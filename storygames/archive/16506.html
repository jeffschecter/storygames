Is this character as good/skilled/talented as I want him to be?  Can he accomplish the tasks I want him to accomplish?  Is the thing I want to do in the game completable as-is, or will the character need to develop/learn/improve in some way to get there?<br/><br/>If the answer is yes, my character is where I wanted him to be, then I'm not all that concerned with mechanical advancement.  But if the system for creating characters doesn't let me make that guy the way I want him to be, then I want a way to get him there.  Or if I'm looking to play a character who learns and improves and develops new abilities, then I need there to be mechanical advancement to be happy.<br/><br/>A secondary, smaller reason why I might want mechanical advancement in a long-term game is to keep from getting bored with the mechanics.  D&amp;D is a fun game, but a steady diet of combats where I have only the same selection of powers, spells, abilities, etc., would be a snorefest.  Mechanical advancement gives me more tools and toys to play with and lets me explore new ways of dealing with recurring situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378195/#Comment_378195" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T08:22:45+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  8:22AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't think of characters in stories that don't change or grow somehow.

I don't need XP to have my character change and grow, I just need to redefine them somehow. Think of how you can move around traits in many fate games.

So the characters needed to scrape together money for basic gear. This gave them tons of incentive to engage in adventuring - at the start of the game they had maybe enough cash to live for a week at the inn in town. Because of this, just a successful looting of bad guys counted as character improvement - it would significantly improve their current situation. And they started out under-geared. So improving their armor or weapons, for example, was a really big thing.<br/><br/>Also, I had a player interested in alchemy, so I whipped up a litle component-based alchemy system. So when she found more components or more recipes for how to use them, those things were a significant boost to her efficacy that didn't have to come through a "level up" process. Plus, it let me work in plot-driven alchemy challenges as interesting story elements - figuring out how to cure someone from a fairy-charm, for example.<br/><br/>Also, the group recruited some henchmen when they knew they were going to face a big fight (which, in the Savage Worlds rules, are fun and easy to add in). So they improved their combat efficacy that way when needed.<br/><br/>Over the course of around 20ish sessions, I think we did regular stat advancement maybe 2 times, which seemed to be plenty enough to keep the players happy.<br/><br/>Of course, the characters started out as being plenty competent at their main areas of expertise right off the bat. I don't think I had anyone boosted their main stats. My son took a perk or two that boosted his combat efficacy a little. I think most of the rest of the players used advancements to round out things they hadn't started out good at but had proved to be useful as the game progressed.<br/><br/>So yeah, advancement/change can come from several directions. And you don't necessarily need much of it if you start out competent (which is my preference).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378643/#Comment_378643" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T10:08:03+00:00" title="May 16, 2012 10:08AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite>even in adventury, tactical games, that bumping up the numbers on the heroes (which usually means bumping up the numbers on the bad guys by a similar amount, making it kind of silly and moot) </blockquote>\nWell, in good adventury, tactical games, leveling up means getting access to more crazy moves, yeah? It enlarges your tactical arsenal, giving you more options. This makes the game richer and deeper as you play, and avoids the need to learn huge amounts of complex rules from the getgo, whilst still enabling the use of huge amounts of complex rules to give a deep tactical gameplay.

It can be. When done well.<br/><br/>Sometimes it isn't, though. Sometimes it's mostly "at 1st level, my best option is to do ____, so I'll do that. At 3rd level, my best option is to do _____ instead, so I'll do that. At 4th level, my options don't really change but my numbers go up (but so do everyone else's, including the bad guys, so it's a wash)."<br/><br/>In my Savage Worlds campaign, the players added some perks that gave them some new options. They also got some gear that gave them new options. But the whole time, their base stats stayed almost all the same, except some of them got like 1 more point of armor protection. I could have gone on with that campaign for years longer without changing the challenge level of the bad guys - maybe add in 1 or 2 more mooks here and there. I don't think I ever would have needed to do a "world shift", like you have to do in D&amp;D every few levels.

Or 5 orcs, or a bear, or whatever the toughest fight from their low-level days was -- just take the fight that was a serious challenge for them back then and give it back to them with no changes and let them beat it in under two rounds without taking a single hit.<br><br>When I did that, it turned out to be the one fight they talked about from that game more than anything else, the fight that defined the most awesome part of the game for them. It was undeniable proof that their characters had become certifiable badasses, as well as long overdue payback on the monsters that terrorized them at first level. They got nothing tangible in-game from it -- no treasure to compare with what they already had, no experience whatsoever, not even a tactical challenge to overcome -- but man, it was glorious.<br><br>Lots of people talk about throwing challenges that are too tough at a group, and yeah, okay, that works; having to run away from the big scary thing is definitely memorable (even if there aren't many players who would remember it <i>fondly</i>). But I highly recommend doing the opposite, too: give 'em something so far beneath their level that they can just cut loose and show off with it and get a sense that their characters' skills and place in the world have truly advanced.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379157/#Comment_379157" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T14:10:23+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  2:10PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>But I highly recommend doing the opposite, too: give 'em something so far beneath their level that they can just cut loose and show off with it and get a sense that their characters' skills and place in the world have truly advanced.</blockquote>\nSure, it makes for a good exception fight. A good contrast.<br/><br/>But I presume you wouldn't have 1/2 of the fights be severely underpowered, 1/4 be appropriately leveled, and 1/4 be severely overpowered, even though that's what, presumably, a somewhat naturalistic view of a world where "levels" are a reasonable representation of how the world looks like would most likely be like.<br/><br/>Most GMs scale the vast majority of their fights to be at somewhere around 3/4 of the current strength of the party. 3rd ed and 4th ed D&amp;D both give explicit instruction in how to do that - older editions were funkier but when I first played, in 2e, every GM I played with shot for that sweet spot as well.<br/><br/>I'm certainly not saying you have to do it that way or that it's the only way to play. In the past few years there's been an increasing interest in doing otherwise.<br/><br/>But the world shift is still a pretty good description of how the vast majority of players play the vast majority of the time with games that have a high level of power increase over time.<br/><br/>Part of the reason I particularly dislike it is that I see the same thing happen in larp games. Characters stick around for 7 years and get so powerful that they can't effectively be in a fight side by side with newbies. If it was a low level fight, the oldies would clean house and the newbies would feel like they were being overshadowed. If it was a high level fight, the oldies would be challenged and the newbies would be running or dead. So organizers end up putting together level-appropriate mods. But the thing about that is that you end up not being able to play with a person you want to play with because they're in a different level range. It's horrible. But it happens over and over because way too many designers look at the power curve in D&amp;D as a good model - but for a large group larp where you constantly have new players joining, it's a horrible model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379159/#Comment_379159" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-21T14:16:22+00:00" title="May 21, 2012  2:16PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, absolutely it's an exception.

It's much more fun to have a character flaw that needs to be overcome to 'advance' the character than gaining more hit points and a better combat adds.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample: you feel guilt and suffer from low esteem because as a teenager you were unable to prevent the minions of the Overlord ransacking your village, killing the men and taking the women for sex slaves. This effects how you interact socially and gives you a burning need to have justice. Each time you strike a blow against the Overlord or free slaves your self-esteem rises and you gain confidence. There would be no specific mechanic for this except maybe a small bonus to aid certain actions  - it would mostly be role-play narrative.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrikes me most of these 'level-up' needs come from D&amp;D anyway and it's never been much other than a miniatures wargame with single figures rather than whole armies.

If you define character advancement as just getting bigger numbers on your character sheet, then no, character advancement isn't necessary.  I don't think advancement should be defined like that, though.   I think it should be defined as character change through play.  If you define it that way (as I did in my article) then, yes, character advancement is absolutely necessary for long term play.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeace,<br/>\n<br/>\n-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
