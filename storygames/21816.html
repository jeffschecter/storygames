Killing the frost trolls would fulfill beliefs for 3/4 of the party, but avoiding the fight was the smarter play.  We ended up letting our least-bloodthirsty party member try to sneak by, but built up a trap that we could spring if they caught us.

Last week\u2019s delve was a one shot, and it was written to be a one shot. There were two monster threats in the whole thing and we only wound up in conflict with one of them. I\u2019d say conflicts are the biggest factor in how long a dungeon will take you. We almost never clear two conflicts in a night.<br/><br/>If you\u2019re playing a dungeon written for another system and there are conflict-level challenges in every room, then you might need a session per room (or a group that really works to avoid direct engagement with threats).<br/><br/>All that said, I\u2019ve found most pacing issues I\u2019ve hit with Torchbearer are more about the expectations of players than the size of the dungeons. I think of it as a real slow-burn game. If players are measuring their progress by their ability to hit the next big conflict and new locale, the mechanics can seem to get between them and the content they want. But there is a lot of great character development in the quiet moments of preparation and recovery.<br/><br/>If the game is slowing down more than you\u2019d like, I\u2019d say pare down the opposition in those dungeons to the bare essentials. If it feels like you\u2019re going slowly, but your players don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d say you\u2019re in a good spot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477284/#Comment_477284" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-28T03:39:09+00:00" title="October 28, 2018  3:39AM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Khimus">@Khimus</a> another thing to note is that players have a good deal of control over pacing.

I wrote an adventure that I\u2019m hoping to polish up for public release and I\u2019m running 3 separate playtest groups to test it out. <br/><br/>The adventure is about five \u2018rooms\u2019 big, set in a cave network under a caldera at the icy northern edges of the world. There is some inspiration from arctic and deep sea ecosystems that I think help it feel unique yet coherent. And the Torchbearer rules really shine when environment is as much of a factor in survival as the monsters.<br/><br/>The first playtest group at bat was all Torchbearer veterans, and one of their number quickly became infected with a contagion. Their in-character banter as they attempted to treat the character was a highlight for me. Their run might end up taking three sessions, as they were bringing in existing characters and needed to hit town before they ventured on.  I expect other groups will clear through everything in two.<br/><br/>The second group is a mix of brand new and somewhat experienced players. They actually got a lot farther, largely because I started them right at shore o the dungeon's island.  Also because they avoided conflict with the first big threat they ran into and then made a map that would let them circumvent it until something changes.<br/><br/>The biggest innovations I'm trying out in this adventure are a timer and a non-corporeal threat.  By timer, I mean the dungeon is fundamentally unstable.  Every time the party camps, the underground gets a little more untenable (according to a hidden tracker) until it eventually becomes deadly to remain inside.  I'm interested to see how this plays out, hopefully putting some urgency into a game where caution is often the best practice.  The non-corporeal threat can be engaged in convince, riddle, or trick conflicts, but not a fight.  It's also not necessary that the party defeat it at all.  I'm curious to see if this prompts the kind of non-linear problem solving I hope it might.<br/><br/>I've got another rounds of playtests this week; looking forward to getting a group all the way through so we can debrief.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477299/#Comment_477299" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-10-28T13:56:13+00:00" title="October 28, 2018  1:56PM">October 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say they don't mind.

I am testing the same adventure with two groups simultaneously and the results have been fascinating.  The groups have taken near opposite approaches so far.  One group tried to fight a nest of giant bristle worms, and succeeded but committed much of their resources to it.  The other just slipped by them.  One group rescued a villager they found underground and confirmed he wasn't contaminated by the sentient bacteria colony dwelling in the caverns below.  The other group assumed the worst and killed him, then fled the scene.<br/><br/>One question that come up in both groups is when to keep the obstacles encountered in the dungeon concrete (Ob. 4 dungeoneer every time the group climbs the chasm into the dungeon and Ob. 5 every time they climb up) or to elide some of these details in the name of dramatic pacing.  There is a side that argues that repeating a similar test with similar stakes (even only when the party chooses to retreat to camp) slows the game without adding new drama.  The other side (where I think I land for now) is that the dungeoneer test raises the dramatic stakes of everything that happens underground, and gives the environment a sense of weight.  The party knows they might get into real trouble underground and they're not be guaranteed a safe retreat back to camp; there is a tough climb between them and any safe (naturally lit) environment.  When obstacles feel more static, and less dependant on the GM's sense of pacing, I also think it allows the players to make more informed plans.  Not "will he call for a test at this cliff" but "well none of us are great dungeoneers, so we need to think of another approach here".<br/><br/>All in all, great session.  I had a player die from an out-of-conflict twist for the first time.  Our Roden was injured the whole session and loathe to suck it up (reduce a skill to lose the injured condition).  He failed a scout roll and was captured by a panicked villager trapped under ground (and possessed by a bacterial entity called the Bloom).  The roden chose to drive an arrow into the villagers eye to break free, failed the fighter test, and was killed in a panic.  The villager wasn't necessarily an enemy, but the situation snowballed and the consequences made sense.  The player seemed satisfied with how it played out, which is a priority/ anxiety for me with character death.  He'll have another character ready for next session.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/michaeln" title="michaeln"><img alt="michaeln" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/michaeln">michaeln</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477591/#Comment_477591" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-07T01:55:54+00:00" title="November  7, 2018  1:55AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice writeup \u2014 thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris" title="ericvulgaris"><img alt="ericvulgaris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/601/nJV8DKZOO3TSE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris">ericvulgaris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477592/#Comment_477592" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-07T03:45:45+00:00" title="November  7, 2018  3:45AM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I appreciate your write up.

I think we agreed that if you're in the same room, always let it ride.  That passed Dungeoneer to traverse a partially submerged chamber lets you move about freely (though the water may be a factor in some other tests, depending on what you do) and dungeoneer doesn't need to be tested again.  So our question is about the test that got you into the dungeon over a substantial static obstacle.<br/><br/>Say the entrance to the dungeon is a sheer chasm.  You have to test to get down.  When the party decides to camp, you want to climb back up to the safe terrain above rather than stay down here with the monsters.  It's the same wall, you passed it before, the physical conditions of the space are unchanged.  However, conditions changed in the sense that you're leaving rather than arriving, and your supplies and conditions are likely different.<br/><br/><br/>So I think it's a grey area up to GM style.  Here's what I think are the considerations for the example of the steep chasm at the mouth of the dungeon:<br/><br/><b>Pros to calling for a test (barring a Good Idea):</b><br/>- Conditions have changed in the sense of player logistics.<br/>- Player planning is more transparent. ("We know it's two tough tests to get out of here, so we need to save at least a torch and a persona for our retreat.").<br/>- Cartography gets to shine ("We want to make a couple trips to the ruined temple, so let's spend one of our precious checks on that, and we're hopefully never facing that Dungeoneering test again.").<br/>- There is a sense of objective <i>weight</i> to the dungeon environment.<br/>-Players have to make a cost/benefit analysis to making camp in a dangerous area, knowing they cannot freely retreat to a safer site. ("Do we have the rations to go back above ground to camp, or do we risk it here.")<br/>- It puts pressures on player decisions below ground ("We don't want to face off with this monster.

Lets find another approach").<br/>- Players control the pacing, rather than the GM ("We know the tests it takes to get back out, and we don't want to burn our resources on them.  So we're making one good delve, looting what we can, and never looking back.")<br/><br/><b>Pros to letting it ride (regardless of player descriptions).</b><br/>- Players are less likely to be bored by doing the same thing more than once; they are always getting to new drama.<br/>- There's no test in an environment that already feels described and known; players aren't spending time in procedures without unless they are discovering new fiction or setting.<br/>- Players might have to burn Fate and Persona on the logistics of getting around below ground and might not have the capacity to take on a more heroic conflict.<br/>- The GM is calling for test only when the stakes feel interesting, so the game might flow more smoothly.<br/><br/>I think a major factor in whether a player is enjoying Torchbearer is: is the game making mundane (in the sense of earthly) tasks interesting, with clear stakes and rich texture, or are mundane tasks (in the sense of boring) keeping you from the character drama or setting lore you showed up for?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_477604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477604/#Comment_477604" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-07T14:15:06+00:00" title="November  7, 2018  2:15PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/michaeln" rel="nofollow">michaeln</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Nice writeup \u2014 thanks!</p></div></blockquote>\nThanks!

Here's the text from the working draft:<br/><br/>"Contact with the skin of another warm-blooded creature will spread Bloom to them.  If the creature is a player-character, they must test Health vs. Bloom\u2019s Nature to resist becoming a host.  For everyone else, Bloom spreads without a test."<br/><br/>The twist there is that Bloom's nature is 1+ the number of its sapient hosts.  So the more hosts it accrues, the harder it is to resist.  And eliminating some of its hosts (through various means) might be part of a party's dungeon strategy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_477701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/477701/#Comment_477701" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-11-10T17:41:15+00:00" title="November 10, 2018  5:41PM">November 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Second session with the 'B team' playtest of my adventure in progress.

Their last session was somewhat of a struggle as their resources dwindled and conditions started to add up.<br/><br/>This week's playtest was levels 1-4.  Their Cleric was able to circumvent two major conflicts by casting 'Chains of Fate' on their enemies, binding them in place so the assassin could murder them.  Because of this, the session's tone took a much darker shift.  The Cleric of law had to atone for these actions in town.

But the real threat of going broke is good incentive not to spend the whole session goofing off on personal errands. Additionally, the pressure of beliefs and goals are a good spur.  Usually, you're going to want to push your character into challenge so you can hit those before the session ends.<br/><br/>I think the other effect of being in a big city (Sigil, in this case, for those familiar with the setting) is that the space of possible actions is wide open and narrowing those options can feel a little more like negotiation than in a more restrictive setting (like a dungeon). Strong signposts from the Gm can help ("You're on a busy city street and these details in particular catch your attention") as can clear systems around contacts ("Who has a friend or mentor in Sigil with a relevant skill?

I think it helped that before play, I didn't belabor how tests worked too much but I did explain the function of each players highest skills, so they knew their strengths when describing their way into new situations.  This group was pretty good at spotlight sharing and tackling situations collaboratively; their 'help' descriptions were consistently evocative.<br/><br/>They came out of the adventure without a ton of loot, but they were quick.  We ran a short town phase and only half the party paid their bills.  They immediately jumped into a darkly comedic response and it was a fun note to end on.<br/><br/>I think having one experienced player made a huge difference.  (A friend was willing to jump into the session.)

Another run of 'In the Care of Bones' for Games on Demand.<br/><br/>This one went fine, as can happen with convention games.  It felt more like an intro to the system than a satisfying stand-alone experience.<br/><br/>Though the party fared far better than the first group (leaving with an astounding 27D of loot) they seemed to <i>feel</i> like they were doing poorly.  I think there was a significant dissonance between expectations and the system for one or two players and that was enough to bring the energy of the group way down. Torchbearer asks you to commit resources, take losses, and roll with significant and lasting consequences.  If you get some treasure and don't die, those resources are well-spent.  If you get the chance to help someone out, or do something beyond looking out for number one (the party), it feels (to me) daring and heroic.  You earn your wins.<br/><br/>For me, these are key features.  For some new players, it's clear that losing a helmet, gaining a condition or two, or having to flee from a a fight that went south, are losing.  And losing is bad.<br/><br/>I've found a lot of ways to make the rules more accessible to new players, and to lower Torchbearer's sometimes frustratingly high barrier to entry.  Because I've found that this is a game that a lot of people <span style="text-decoration: underline;">love</span> once they get the chance to dig into it.  But if people bounce off the system's emphasis on failure (you need it to grow, but it still hurts) then there doesn't feel like a lot I can do to develop buy in.  We just try to wrap the session neatly, and move on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478414/#Comment_478414" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-03T15:20:38+00:00" title="December  3, 2018  3:20PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 3, 2018 4:51PM by moconnor.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PAX Unplugged Session 3.  Running <a href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">@Fuseboy</a> 's 'Circle of Wolves' for friends.<br/><br/>I love this module.  The location is tiny, one small woodland clearing with a lot of interesting details and situations on the knife-edge of catastrophe.  There's no element of travel, but plenty to investigate and a feeling of dynamism because the NPCs and monsters show up in waves.  I made a rules-error that impacted the pacing of the adventure, as I forgot that Might 5 creatures are too powerful to capture outright, but the party also kind of had a 'good idea' to justify it: they were not trapping the monster conventionally but luring it into a volcanic chasm were it (a creature of the frozen north) would be easier defeat.  Ultimately it played out well.<br/><br/>These were all a crew that I love playing with and I enjoyed that the ball was often in their court.  They correctly assumed that just attempting to kill the monster in the woods would be foolish, and they had enough threads to pull on to find an alternate path to victory.<br/><br/>One point of GM skill/art that came up is balancing how helpful a helpful NPC can be.  If the old man guarding the standing stones has all the answers for how to defeat the monster, then the players are just listening to your exposition than following your instructions.<br/><br/>Here's how I tried to play the potentially very helpful hermit:<br/><br/> - Eager to talk about things immediately in his wheelhouse (big picture stuff about standing stones = good, monsters = bad).  there are a couple big tip-offs about what to look out for but no real solutions to problems.  He's not sending them off on a quest.<br/><br/>- Willing to give more substantive info if persuaded deferentially or provoked with unexpected questions (so what the characters say matters beyond 'more info pls').<br/><br/>- Willing to help on tests when not in peril or insulted. +1D for help is really handy but not going to unspool the tension of the adventure.<br/><br/>- Almost totally unwilling to do anything risky himself (it's not his adventure).<br/><br/>I think he was a fun and interesting element, and he gave the PCs a lot of personality to play off of (our magician took a bath with him and shared his cyldwort pipe) without taking the spotlight off the players.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_478416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478416/#Comment_478416" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-03T15:56:45+00:00" title="December  3, 2018  3:56PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PAX Unplugged Session 4: Playing 'The Dread Crypt of Skogenby'.<br/><br/>The reality of scheduling games in a con meant that I only got to take part in the latter half of a two-session run of Skogenby.  I played a Magician for the first time and really enjoyed it.   This session was probably the highlight of the weekend for me, as I got to play with friends from NY that I hadn't seen in months.  It's great to play with a group whose sensibilities for dramatic stakes and tone are right in line with your own.  I definitely roleplay for the table, knowing that if I bring my best, they'll see it.   And likewise, it's fun to listen to interesting characters and try to build on/ play off their personality.<br/><br/>A girl from the nearby village died in the dread crypt and it was partially our fault.  The clerics attempt to make things right with the village and atone for his god were a big focus of our denouement.  The GM did a great job not offering an easy out from this, or making it totally futile.  The cleric is started on a long path.  I especially appreciated our warrior's choice to hide the truth from the village about the girl being possessed, to spare them the additional grief.  It's cool to see the manipulator skill get used for reasons that aren't selfish.  I'd say the emergent theme of this session was: 'the road to hell is paved with good intentions'.<br/><br/>I really enjoy how risky a first session feels.  I can't rely on Fate and Persona to power through anything, so I need to play a little more carefully and be ready to take consequences.  Starting with a full pack means a lot of tools and resources to burn, so i try to pick carefully and then be ready to part with them quickly.  During a first session, what I am focus most on is having an actionable belief and leaning into it hard.  If I have a character that believes in something and dies for it, that doesn't feel pointless.  If the character lives, then they'll earn the rewards they need to get a big win next time and eventually level.  The other stuff (I bought a donkey!) is all extra.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478417/#Comment_478417" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-03T16:09:29+00:00" title="December  3, 2018  4:09PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Final note from PAX: recovery rolls are a great opportunity to make character introspection a part of play.

The Torchbearer stats for a Kraken are amazingly powerful.  They would likely have faced devastating consequences for sticking around.<br/>- There were two level 6 characters alongside a level 2 character and a brand new Sea Elf.  The Sea Elf got to get in on a lot of helping rolls and use handy Nature and wises, so it never felt he was irrelevant to the (very powerful) party.<br/>- I provided the hook and then passed out more specific rumors on folded index cards (a lead on a contract to the assassin, valuable lore to the elf, a lost fisherman to noble the sea elf, etc).  This gave some more options for different goals and gave some interesting decision points mid-adventure.<br/><br/>Challenges:<br/>- I tried to play this session without conflicts unless it was obviously <b>the</b> big moment, which meant I did some waffling.  I think when they ambushed a group of cultists and attempted to catch a few of them in the Sea Elf's net, it would have been a good time for a Capture conflict.  I think it was mostly a missed opportunity for interesting compromises.<br/>- I fought the urge to have a Flee conflict against The Kraken, and I'm glad I did.  I think they often just devolve into 'We keep running'.  There's not enough granular fictional detail to support the handling time.  I think I'm going to hold out on running a Flee conflict unless they are crossing a substantial amount terrain.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_478879">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin" title="Aaron_Griffin"><img alt="Aaron_Griffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/469/nQL6632G2O226.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin">Aaron_Griffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/478879/#Comment_478879" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-12T05:17:20+00:00" title="December 12, 2018  5:17AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really interested in the play without true conflicts, as it's what I'm aiming for in two hour sessions.

The two PCs capturing roll Fighter (4+1 Help).  The two being cultists captured, plus the other two in rage roll Fighter (4+3 Help).  The PCs failed, the whole group of cultists is on them: so it's full fight or flee.  The magician casts Word of Binding on the limp net, catching the two cultists loosely cloaked in it.

As soon as the PCs asked the NPC to go against an instinct or put themselves at risk, it was a test.  Convincing the villager to not run for the exit was a test.  Convincing the villager unaffected by bloom to keep an eye on the one who was a 'host' was a good idea.  We didn't run a conflict.  I find that unless there is a major single issue to decide, the fiction falls behind the dice in most TB social conflicts.<br/><br/>In another session, when the party wanted to convince a village to flee their dangerous home and resettle elsewhere, that was a 'convince crowd' conflict against those that argued vehemently for staying.  It worked because there was a single decision point (leave or stay) but a lot of perspectives and reasons to argue for each side.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479368/#Comment_479368" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-29T16:43:16+00:00" title="December 29, 2018  4:43PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing that worked well this session was adding factors to a fight that happened in water.  The party battled a giant eel.  While fighting in water, the adventurers suffered a penalty (-1 success) to all actions.  However, if they got 3 successes (after the penalty) on a Maneuver, they could drag the eel into the shallows and fight it there.  In the shallows, the eel would suffer a penalty instead of the party.  They strategized about when to Maneuver (there's a sort of rock paper scissors mechanic, and Maneuvers are susceptible to Feints) and then chose their actions.  The party's Minotaur spent his Persona and used his Hauling nature to put everything into dragging the eel out of the depths.  It paid off and the party was able to turn the tide.<br/><br/>But in the next round, the party convinced the Minotaur to script Defend to pull his fallen comrades back into the fight.  He had a bad feeling about it, given that the eel's weapon that round was 'camoflage' and the eel might Feint right through his defenses.  His instinct was right, and though the party won, the Minotaur emerged barely alive.<br/><br/>When the time came to award an MVP, everyone looked to the Minotaur's player without hesitation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin" title="Aaron_Griffin"><img alt="Aaron_Griffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/469/nQL6632G2O226.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_Griffin">Aaron_Griffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479369/#Comment_479369" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-29T18:23:59+00:00" title="December 29, 2018  6:23PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, using Maneuver to change the environment is really good.

We scaled a magic rope to a castle in the sky, took control of the robotic stewards, battled with haunted vines, and lost one of our own to the death ray of a demonic guardian.  The curse was lifted and the people of the castle freed from the vines that had trapped them.<br/><br/>The big picture beats were very Tolkien-meets-Miyazaki but it being Torchbearer, it was full of setbacks, compromises, and small failures.  The final battle was wholly uncertain and the odds were against us.  I was as bought-in as I've been for any RPG conflict.<br/><br/>That said, the eighth session was the real highlight for me: the winter phase.  The Torchbearer winter phase has a great structure for reflecting on the previous year of play and discussing how characters have been changed by their adventures.  You gain new traits based on your character's actions and a new 'wise' based on what your character learned this year.<br/><br/>The sea-elf Reteri told the story of Orrin's refusal to leave the Armdorians trapped within the vines, how he demanded the party put their lives on the line.  Orrin gained the trait "Relentless".  I chose curse-wise as Orrin's new area of knowledge and the group approved of it.  When I put down a character for months, these are the first things I look at to remember what they were all about.<br/><br/>I'm taking over as GM next week and I'm looking forward to giving Orrin some rest and throwing the rest of the party (and Castle Ardmore) into peril.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482880/#Comment_482880" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-02T19:33:16+00:00" title="May  2, 2019  7:33PM">May 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris">@ericvulgaris</a> from TV is on here? that paladin's demesne song got really stuck in my head                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482902/#Comment_482902" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-03T12:46:04+00:00" title="May  3, 2019 12:46PM">May 3</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I am a big fan of <a href="/forums/profile/ericvulgaris%27s">@ericvulgaris's</a> Torchbearer streams.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482994/#Comment_482994" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-07T13:37:37+00:00" title="May  7, 2019  1:37PM">May 7</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2019 3:38PM by moconnor.">edited May 7</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran the first session of <a href="/forums/profile/fuseboy%27s">@fuseboy's</a> Chains of Heaven in Torchbearer last night.  I hooked into the adventure with an unusual bang: the party had been traveling peacefully aboard the Floating Castle Ardmore after freeing it from a curse in the previous adventure.  Suddenly they heard a wild, shrieking note from the Organ of the Four winds, the magical instrument which steers the castle through the skies.  The whole castle, and the mass of stone beneath it, titled wildly and began to veer toward a nearby mountain.  As the peak neared, the party saw that it was capped with an ancient, ruinous keep.  In the middle of the keep was an enormous crater.  The king of Ardmore said that only one weapon that could land such a devastating blow: the White Lance of Deel.<br/><br/>Reteri the Sea Elf manages to command a wind powerful enough to slow the castle's fall, and the party soared over to the keep on hang-gliders (setting a rope as a zip-line for others to follow.  During the flight, Reteri spotted a hunched figure shuffling down the stairs to the level below.<br/><br/><i>[Successful Orator test to play the Organ.  Successful Sailor test to hang-glide to the keep.  Good idea to take turns riding a zipline.]</i><br/><br/>The party landed right inside of the castle's second floor, the collapsed ceiling above them showing clear blue skies above.  Derrol the Elvin Ranger cast Supernal Vision and saw a source of great power at the heart of the keep, drawing in magic like a black hole.  It was this power that had snared the Organ of the Four Winds and still threatened to shatter Ardmore upon the cliffs.<br/><br/><br/><i>[Successful Arcanist test for Supenal Vision, Successful Lore Master test to sense auras.]</i><br/><br/>Olga, Princess of Ardmore, crept forward carefully to the edge of the pit at the keep's center and saw that it was full of a great mass of crushed metal and stone, rippling with silvery light.  As she looked down into the pit, a figure emerged from a ramshackle stone structure to her right: a robed acolyte wielding a milky-white orb.  A pack of fighters in rags emerged from the shadows of the stone winch house, making a wild-eyed charge.<br/><br/><i>[Good idea to use her staff to brace herself as she approached the pit.]</i><br/><br/>Derrol made a split-second shot with his bow, knocking the orb to the floor before the spell was cast.  Reteri dashed to catch the orb before the fighters could get to it.  He caught it in his net and tossed it to Derrol, who made a cast the spell within blindly, not knowing its effects.  The nearest fighter turned to dust in an instant, his component parts drifting away on the wind.  Derrol was shocked, as were the surrounding fighters.  Olga stepped into the pause and commanded the fighters to cease their assault.  Her presence was magnified by the cursed crown upon her head and the fighters retreated to a stone tower, she demanded the name of the one these fighters serve.  They hissed back: "Nacharta."<br/><br/><i>[Successful Fighter test to shoot the globe.  Successful Health test to beat the fighters to the orb.  Good Idea to cast from the orb.  Successful Orator test to break the fighter's morale.]</i><br/><br/>After the encounter, the party was weary and hungry, so they shared rations within the winch house.  They also took sets of iron hooks from off the walls that seemed to be for climbing the chain down into the pit below.  A they finished their meal, they heard a gasping scream from just outside the winch house.  They watched as a cloud of dust assembled itself back into human form, gasped for air, and promptly vomited.  The fighter they had assumed was dead stood before them.  He spotted the party, and bolted in the direction the other fighters had fled.  Reteri gave chase, the rest of the party behind him.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Torchbearer

fighter with his net just before he escaped through the tower door.  Clevin the Paladin questioned him, searching the fighter's soul for evil deeds.  They learned then that this fighter was a local climber and guide who had had been ensorceled by Nacharta. He had killed his boss under Nacharta\u2019s command and only now was grasping how how will had been crushed under the sorceress\u2019s. He asked to be set free, so he could hurl himself from the tower before her spell took hold of him again. Reteri instead bound him in rope and promised to return when Nacharta hadn\u2019t been dealt with.<br/><br/><i>[Successful Ritualist to perform Vow to the Lords of Justice.  Good idea to bind him.]</i><br/><br/>Derrol decided they should search the other towers before traveling below.  The first tower they approached was a block of solid stone, chipped away at fruitlessly, and surrounded with blunted tools. There was a door drawn in chalk upon its, side and Derrol sensed that this was another attempt to enter the tower, though he couldn\u2019t be sure if it had been successful.<br/><br/>The party then inspected a cairn set near a massive hole in the keep\u2019s outer wall. It was full of seeds and grains. They observed for a time and saw a raven fly over and deposit another mouthful.  They noted this unusual farming method and moved on.<br/><br/>The final tower they inspected had mostly crumbled into ruin. They were nearly ready to move on when Derrol looked up and saw a hunched figure up in the rafters, wrapped head to toe in rust-colored robes.  He looked upon it with his supernal vision and saw that a glamor of some kind was masking it's appearance.  Derrol conferred with the group and they decided that this creature might represent another faction than the servants of Nacharta.<br/><br/>Olga coaxed the creature down from its perch and spoke with him.  Is was obvious even from a distance that he was not truly human; something shifted and writhed beneath his skin as if ready to break free.  It called itself a 'Nuss".  The Nuss insisted that they leave; if the party tampered with anything here, they would be rent to pieces.  Derrol asked him who he served, and the Nuss professed undying loyalty to his lady, Sigordine.  Clevin asked about the relationship between Sigordine and Nacharta.  The Nuss likened it to a falcon toying with a songbird, Sigordine being the falcon.  Derrol convinced the Nuss to take them to Sigordine, despite his obvious fear of displeasing her, by emphasizing that all they wanted was to leave.<br/><br/><i>[Good idea to approach the Nuss respectfully and never question Sigordine's perfection.  Successful persuader test to be guided to Sigordine.]</i><br/><br/>The Nuss guided the party downstairs into the heart of the keep.  Down a featureless hallway they heard two voices in tense exchange.  One voice was old and raspy, the other high and clear (Derrol noted it as not-quite-Elvin).  Derrol led the party in sneaking within view of those speaking and saw Narcharta (a human, hunched and robed, perhaps hundreds of years old) arguing with Sigordine (an eight foot tall humanoid, utterly translucent, seeming to be made of lightly tinted glass or clear water) about the Gods who had attacked the keep many ages ago.  Narcharta claimed that Deel had killed his fellows in a rage.  Sigordine insisted that Deel was betrayed, the temptation of the Pit's powers had corrupted even the Gods.  The party noted that Sigordine was standing in the center of a protective circle of crushed quartz.<br/><br/>Derrol wanted to speak to Sigordine without Nacharta interrupting, so he cast Celestial music to draw Nacharta away.  Unfortunately, the effect was powerful: when Nacharta ran off to investigate the sound of far-off singing, Sigordinge flashed out of existence (presumably in pursuit).<br/><br/><i>[Successful scout test to approach unseen.  Successful casting of Celestial Music.]</i><br/><br/>The session ended as the party heard footsteps approaching down the stairs.  Nacharta's acolytes had returned in force.<br/><br/><b>Rewards:</b><br/>Every character acted on their belief and worked toward or achieved their goal.<br/><br/><b>MVP: </b>Reteri for keeping Ardmore from crashing into the peak.<br/><b>Teamworker:</b> Derrol for gaining lots of useful information through Supernal Vision.<br/><b>Embodiment:</b> Reteri and Derrol for the chase scene around the edge of the pit, and the hand-off of the orb.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483000/#Comment_483000" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-07T18:06:21+00:00" title="May  7, 2019  6:06PM">May 7</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was the rare Torchbearer session without a single failed roll, but things remained (imo) interesting and tense.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483898/#Comment_483898" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-21T15:15:02+00:00" title="May 21, 2019  3:15PM">May 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Orrin (Level 2 Human Magician) in the first half of a two-shot Torchbearer adventure about finding a hidden cache of medicine to aid some refugees of a border war.  It was planned as a one-shot, a couple failed rolls in Torchbearer can dramatically change the pace of the game.<br/><br/>Over the course of the session, I was hungry/ thirsty, afraid, exhausted, and sick.  There were a couple other conditions spread around the party.  This density of conditions meant a camp phase focused on recovery was all-but-necessary.  Luckily everyone in the party had at least one check, and our Cleric and Paladin had a lot of recovery-related abilities.<br/><br/>I got back into fighting shape (somewhat literally, since my Magician has Fighter 3) but we ran out of time for the session.  We'll pick up next week, following the sounds of cursed laughter into the chasm where the precious medicine is stowed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_484505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484505/#Comment_484505" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-28T15:55:34+00:00" title="May 28, 2019  3:55PM">May 28</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My magician hit 3rd level (yay!) and was too broke to pay his bills (boo!).
