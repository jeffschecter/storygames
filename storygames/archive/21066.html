I was shooting in the dark, just taking a wild guess about who might be into it (not to mention who might be free on short notice!).<br/><br/>Much to my surprise, my guesses were spot on. We played my game <i>Musette</i> (which is ideal as an introductory story game for people with no exposure to such things), and had a total blast. One of my favourite sessions of all time.<br/><br/>Here's the amazing thing, though: one my friends asked me if I had some paper she could doodle on, and then proceeded to draw through the entire game. At the end, we had a visual record of everything that happened in the game, like a stream-of-consciousness record of events, images, and notable phrases or quotes. <br/><br/>What a wonderful gift! I had a lot of fun looking it over and remembering the various events of the story. (It helps that it was a particularly fun session and a really involved, convoluted story - something which can often go terribly wrong in a collaborative story game - which nevertheless wrapped up neatly and conclusively!)<br/><br/>Oddly enough, we started the game by talking about the concept of a "mind palace" - and these drawings are like an illustration of a "mind palace" of the fiction we created.<br/><br/>What's especially cool is that her illustrations are spread out in non-linear order on the pages, but when disparate storylines combined in our story, it was reflected in the positioning of the images - they come together from opposite sides of the page.<br/><br/>(You can follow along somewhat by going from number to number, which indicate the order of events.)<br/><br/>Everyone should be so lucky as to have a "real-time illlustrator" at their game sessions. I highly recommend it (if you can find one, of course)!<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/MusetteStorySketch1.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://ihousenews.pbworks.com/f/MusetteStorySketch2.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_462102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462102/#Comment_462102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-18T21:38:31+00:00" title="April 18, 2017  9:38PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've encountered similar phenomena. It is quite nice, and your artifact is very cool.<br/><br/>One thing I've done recently with the resident doodler in our D&amp;D campaign has been to give him a bunch of templates for paper miniatures to draw on. The result has been a series of miniatures for the player characters. I sometimes feed the doodlers with specialized mapping duties ("here, clarify this and put in some color to indicate terrain") and such as well.<br/><br/>Most doodlers have a distinct tendency towards limiting themselves to particular topics, though, which limits their usefulness in e.g. campaign logging. Our D&amp;D campaign currently has one who does nice satires (somewhat similar to your sample in tone), but generally doodles so slowly that she only produces one per session or so. Another one (the one I tasked with the miniatures duty) produces an endless stream of drawings of armsmen (think Warhammer style) while participating in the game intensively, apparently without putting any particular thought to it. We currently don't have a truly passionate cartographer/doodler, which is a shame, because the map quality is distinctly better when you have a doodler with that specialty in the group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_462103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/462103/#Comment_462103" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-18T21:43:13+00:00" title="April 18, 2017  9:43PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh, that reminds me of "party" posters I used to in college and just afterwards.
