It's also really fast, compared to most character creation, which is great.  We made 5 killer marines right off the bat and when Dan showed up late, after we had started, we had him a character ready in about 5 minutes.<br/><br/><b>Issue #1:</b> Several of the players also remarked that they were disappointed that the random-roll trooper names were so stereotypically Anglo, lacking any sign of ethnic diversity, but they fixed that by having troopers named Yamada and Drogba.<br/><br/><b>Issue #2:</b> Neil ended up Corporal, having picked FA8/NFA2, despite his buttons really being geared (at least, according to other games I've played with him) towards happily shooting things and watching them explode.  In fact, that's almost certainly why he picked those stats.  He was not really interested in ordering other folks around in practice, though he liked the idea of having the power of rank in theory.  He was really just happy to have the e-cannon so he could maximize his kills.  Later on, this meant that April, the Sergeant, was playing the only real leader in the group, which meant the inter-character dynamics were less interesting than they otherwise might have been, I think.<br/><br/>In any case, while traveling on the warship Skagerrak, the order came down from a drunken Lieutenant, who honestly I should have played better, that the unit would be deployed on Caravaggio, where they would mop up any alien forces they found and await further instructions.  April successfully made her NFA roll (the only player to do so) and recalled that Caravaggio had been nuked from orbit, Death Star-style, wiping the planet from the charts completely.  Despite it being a strange planet to be assigned to, April didn't pass this information on to the troopers.<br/><br/>Then, in the dropship, I described the assholes in the Navy as frequently dropping squads of marines far enough away from the surface of the planet that gravity would not actually carry them to the planet's surface, but would simply leave them orbiting until aliens or radiation or some other thing killed them.  Also, I pulled something inspired by John Harper's "Alpha Protocol": Protocol 411.  Eric and David (I think?), making their NFA rolls to figure out what it meant, discovered that, for this mission, the waste elimination systems on their armor were being placed offline, meaning that they would have to stew a bit in their suits (a problem when aliens cause "accidents") and not jettison any wastes until they returned to the Skagerrak. Eric tried to simply pretend he had activated Protocol 411, but April, on a successful NFA roll, spotted him and gave him some lip until he complied.<br/><br/>But then the doors slid open and everyone had to jump out.  We had brainstormed 5 NPC trooper names and distinguishing traits, so April and Neil had to beat the shit out of Red, the "Scaredy Cat," and throw his semi-conscious body out of the dropship.<br/><br/>Once they jumped, I described what they were falling towards: a cluster of drifting asteroids and dust that had once been the planet Caravaggio, before it was nuked from orbit.  Dev and David failed their NFA roll and got their rocket chutes tangled up, thrusters firing everywhere, and crashed into one of the largest rocks.  April's first order to Dan was "Soldier, drop a grenade down that hole!" pointing at a nearby crater.  Dan complied, launching us into the first encounter as alien bugs swarmed out of the hole in response.  Hilariously, though maybe less so for him, Dan was stuck using grenades as his initial default, since that's what he had out when the bugs attacked.<br/><br/><b>Issue #3:</b> An increased number of players dramatically changes the way Threat Tokens need to be apportioned during play.  I put out three blips in the beginning, but the players had wasted those bugs by halfway through the first round.  Some players didn't even get to shoot and I certainly didn't get to activate the bugs special ability.  This left some of the players rather unsatisfied, initially.  With higher numbers of players, even the early conflicts need 5 or 6 Threat Tokens.  Sure, you can usually count on at least one or two players failing their FA roll, but that still left 4-5 successes in this case, wiping out the bugs quick.<br/><br/><b>Issue #4:</b> The bugs' special ability was "Flee," which also radically changes the way Threat Tokens need to be spent.  What I should have done, in hindsight, was thrown 10 Tokens all at once, overwhelming them, but then had the bugs flee once they started getting killed.  Actually, looking over the list of abilities, a lot of them would seem to alter the GM's strategy for spending tokens, in addition to how they change the way you have the aliens behave in combat.  This wasn't immediately obvious to me until it came up in play.<br/><br/>(more later)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165915/#Comment_165915" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T08:55:26+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  8:55AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<em>recalled that Caravaggio had been nuked from orbit,</em><br/>...and, shockingly, we learn that's <strong>not</strong> the only way to be sure.<br/><br/>Drats!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165933/#Comment_165933" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T10:29:22+00:00" title="August 28, 2008 10:29AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, the names are mostly just former <a href="http://www.claymores.co.uk/claymores.php" rel="nofollow">Scottish Claymores</a> players and coaches.

As a way to validate everyone's experiences playing the game?  Awesome.  Eric, if you can hold back on your tendency to sometimes play a game once, have a mediocre experience, and largely dismiss it, hopefully John can hold back his undying love for this game enough for you to actually talk about this.  Not trying to moderate, just trying to avoid yet another internet meltdown between people I respect (see <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6779" rel="nofollow">Eric vs. Vincent</a>).<br/><br/>John, as some background, the bugs bit it big time in this session.  In the stuff I haven't described yet, nobody used combat drugs, nobody used armor, and the one Strength that was used was mostly Dan wanting to show off by killing the alien queen.  At no time did any of the troopers seem to be in any real danger.  For the aliens, I rolled three separate 10s, when the AA was 5, plus a couple 8s.  It was a cake walk.  The most dangerous part was the troopers blowing each other up with grenades, which they did a lot since there were no other damage sources to make that very dangerous.<br/><br/>All in all, while fun, I don't think the game really conveyed the full potential of 3:16, which was a disappointment for me, even though I enjoyed the game and am eager to try it again when we get the chance.  A mixture of just getting familiar with the game, really bad rolls for the aliens, less inter-character interaction than I would have liked, and a couple players (like Eric) that were really looking for a mechanically potent option besides "shoot" or "move" (he eventually settled on taking credit for other people's kills through NFA rolls, which was funny), made for less of a 40K feel (which is what I think Eric was expecting) and more of a goofy war comedy.  I wish we had been able to run a second mission, which I think would have gone very differently (and would have been a great contrast with the first mission), but we didn't have time and people were tired.<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, nobody ever felt the need to cancel everyone else's action, because the aliens kept rolling so poorly.  I didn't even get the chance to introduce that rule.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166018">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166018/#Comment_166018" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T18:24:47+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  6:24PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clear, I <i>really want</i> to like this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166019/#Comment_166019" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T18:59:54+00:00" title="August 28, 2008  6:59PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eric just called me and we talked.

It's meant to be a spectrum, across 20 planets. You check off the AA items and the powers as you go, right? So those easy AA worlds and the less-awesome powers get used up and you have to face the brutal stuff eventually -- no getting out of it. Hit them with AA 10 and Ignores Armor if everyone is whining about how easy it is.<br/><br/>But really, fighting the aliens is SO not what the game is about. I am not the least bit surprised that mowing down essentially helpless aliens "felt flat." I mean... duh. Maybe it even felt cruel and pointless?<br/><br/>Eric: "The bugs didn't feel like a viable conflict partner," should be quoted on the back of the book. That is gold.

The PCs were carving their way through my Threat Tokens and I think the only wounds were self-inflicted grenade damage as the PCs piled over each other to wipe out the aliens first.<br/><br/>Basically, in low Threat Token encounters the guys rolling high were leaving none for the lower rollers or failures. Good! Roll better next time. Or put your fellow Troopers at ranges where they can't kill (e.g. Far Range where your trusty Slug Rifle will kill and an E-Cannon plain won't). This is not the Kumbaya Space Marines where we all hug and share kills.<br/><br/>So, anyway, I just rolled on to the next planet. Because the advice for the GM is that there are always more planets (and the game is stacked so that while a TPK is possible, it's not likely). On the next planet I rolled better, had a higher AA because of the levelling up, and I picked what I thought was one of the "harsher" Special Abilities (I think it was Ambush or Lasting Wounds).<br/><br/>Very rapidly, with a couple of favourable dice rolls, everyone was at Crippled, Armour out and burning up Flashbacks. It was pretty cool to see them get a wak-up call.<br/><br/>But as the GM I can't engineer that, or as a player you can't say "Oh, I'm comfortable with having a rough encounter now". The roll of the dice, the tactical positioning of the PCs in an encounter, the choosing of their weapons (and at what ranges they upgrade them), who moves on their turn, etc. provides the push to what is happening in the fiction.<br/><br/>And there are times the GM will just keep rolling exactly on the AA. It will be a pain in the ass, more so if you are out of Flashbacks and no one wants to use theirs to save you. And maybe inside someone'll secretly be cheering the aliens on. Who knows?<br/><br/>If you want to just experience a single session of grim war, well, I'm not sure the game will give you that unless you specifically pick planet choices that give you that. And it certainly won't happen if every PC has 2 Flashbacks at their disposal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166059/#Comment_166059" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T06:53:46+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  6:53AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That all being said, it seems like you can play through planets quickly.

I think the variance between planets, instead of them just being all the same difficulty or whatever, probably drives interesting variations in inter-player interactions.  Also, since it was our first session, a lot of things were shakier than I would have liked.  I felt like I did a really mediocre job GMing and that definitely didn't help.  Honestly, it's been a long time since I GM'ed <i>anything</i> regularly, since I've been playtesting Geiger and playing a bunch of GMless and quazi-GMless stuff.<br/><br/>I wasn't meaning this play report thread to be critical of the game at all, just a warning, amidst all the fanfare surrounding 3:16, that the game doesn't run itself and even folks who've played a lot of indie stuff and love Agon can sometimes stumble into difficulties, especially because we were trying to run it straight from the book, without having experienced it at GenCon like lots of other folks.  That's inevitably a more awkward transition, in my experience, even with the best game texts. And, as with other games we've tried for the first time, SGBoston, being a random assortment of whoever shows up on any given night, and including people with a very wide range of play preferences, is usually pretty good about finding ways to break things.<br/><br/>Honestly, I kinda want Eric to run this game at some point (next time?), but we'll see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166069/#Comment_166069" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T07:45:22+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  7:45AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just whispered this to John Harper, but I think it's also important to note in this thread (maybe I should make a disclaimer for every SGBoston play thread):<br/><br/>SGBoston is definitely dysfunctional at times, both in the GNS sense and just straight-up dysfunctional. That's part of the cost of running an open game night, I suspect. We get people from all sorts of backgrounds trying out all sorts of games. Some of them fly and some of them don't. I think the people who've become SGBoston regulars, like me and Eric, enjoy the process of experimenting with new stuff, even if it doesn't match their own preferences and doesn't always work incredibly smoothly. It's a great workshop for playtesting for many of these reasons but it's not always the best place to just play something "straight up" for enjoyment, unless it's something that most people are familiar and comfortable with or you select out of the assembled masses a subgroup of those with certain play styles. I think this is definitely a part of why 3:16 was problematic the first time, but, frequently, many of the differences and dysfunctions get ironed out the more we play something together and I imagine that'll also happen here.<br/><br/>Just to throw that out there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166071/#Comment_166071" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T08:11:12+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  8:11AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No problem, Jonathan.

(In fact, the rotating of GM is something that I love in Joe Prince's forthcoming Labyrinths &amp; Lycanthropes -- but it might not be everyone's cup of tea.)<br/><br/>The first few planets are where everyone learns the rules and no one need worry about getting straight into the angst or death (I hope it'll come in its own time). I'm also assuming that you've not had an Ambush yet? The description for that kinda covers people not getting kills.

Instead, it determines whether or not we learn about a new shitty aspect of your shitty life in the process, or perhaps witness an example of it's ongoing shit-tastic shit. <br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Trooper: "I think I'm beefy enough for this."<br/>Me: "Okay, NFA roll."<br/>Trooper fails<br/>Me: "Yup, you are. You feel no inadequacy about your biceps. You're also addicted to NURPS."<br/>Trooper:  "Huh? NURPS?"<br/>Me: "It's a type of steroid." [I turn to the other Troopers] "You other Troopers feel inadequate around this guy in the showers."<br/>Other Troopers: "..." "Umm, based on what I know about steroids..."<br/>Me: [Turning back to the first Trooper] "Also, you have cancer."<br/><br/>Other things: I did the chargen in character, like Lacuna. "Trooper! What the fuck is your name?!" This continued as we allocated points to FA and NFA and so on. Then they made NFA rolls. I told them that the company that made their MandelBrite suits used to be the Mandel and Brite companies, which merged after years of corporate litigation that cost millions of lives. <br/><br/>The losers of this NFA roll had to tell me which of their close relatives they saw killed during the litigation and what warcrime was inflicted on the victim. The winners told me how their parents spent their day's "recreation" at Aztechnology (my setting inspiration had a lot of Shadowrun in it). That provoked the following:<br/><br/>"Wait, I thought there was no more work."<br/>"Right, ever since the Terran High Corporate Court defined work as shit you do that you get paid for after the fact. Your parents get paid beforehand, and so they're wageslaves. Nobody works anymore, see?"<br/><br/>Remember: Terra is a Paradise. A lifetime of very aggressive and subversive marketing means that you will agree with that statement every time, and offer complex rationales as to why it's true. <br/><br/>Anyway, by the time the session was half over, the Troopers were determined to never get promoted. They wanted no part of the shit that was getting tossed at the Sarge; I addressed most of my proactive GM'ing directly at the Sarge, which put him in the hot seat frequently...<br/><br/>"Sarge, what the hell is your squad doing next?"<br/>"Sarge, let's get this shit going!"<br/>"Sarge, your squad's waiting. Let's have some orders!"<br/><br/>...and so on, with frequent NFA rolls to see how much completely arbitrary and sadistic punishment was inflicted on him by the Lt. in the process (the Lt. was basically Dr. Cox from "Scrubs"). This also had the effect of enforcing the chain of command. At no point did I ever prompt a Trooper for proactive action.

The squad has just landed on planet. Richard, as Sarge, wants to figure out which way Easy Company went so they can make a delivery. He's going to accomplish that. I ask for an NFA roll. He fails. I look at him and say, "south. They definitely went south." <br/><br/>Richard cringes and heads south. They continue for a bit until the Lt. radios in.<br/><br/>[paraphrasing]<br/>Lt: Hey, Nancy, where the hell are you going?<br/>Richard: Towards Easy Company, sir!<br/>Lt: Oh, good. Put Sgt. Krav on.<br/>Richard: ...That's me, sir.<br/>Lt: Oh really, Betty? I thought I was talking to someone else, since I told the Sarge that I wanted him to FIND EASY COMPANY. According to my tracking system here, you're going AWAY FROM THEM!<br/>*Richard fails a NFA roll and collapses in pain as the Lt. takes over his neural implants*<br/>Lt: Do ya think you can do that, Nancy? CAN YOU MANAGE THAT ONE FUCKING THING?! Here, let me help.<br/>*Bright red arrows are superimposed on everyone's field of vision*<br/>Lt: Now follow the arrow, Betty, and don't fucking call me again until you get to Easy Company.<br/>Richard: Thank you, sir. {out of character} Who is this guy?<br/>Lt: I DID NOT JUST FUCKING HEAR YOU SAY THAT, DID I, ALICE?<br/>Richard: NO SIR!<br/>Lt: Good. By the way, I just told all of Charlie Company to piss on your bed.<br/>*Radio goes dead*<br/><br/>So they follow the arrows right to (the remains of) part of Easy Company. As soon as Richard declared what his squad was doing, it was going to happen. The dice decided how much he was going to dislike his "success."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_167278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/167278/#Comment_167278" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-05T12:37:51+00:00" title="September  5, 2008 12:37PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, my Sarge was the idiot who almost killed his whole Squad by insisting we climb a ridge.
