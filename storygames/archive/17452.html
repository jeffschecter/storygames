A spooky-themed Fiasco double feature!<br/><br/>First up, we played the Regina\u2019s Wedding playset (from the excellent Fiasco Companion) mixing in the just-released Living Dead add-on (which can act as a supplement to any playset). I\u2019d seen someone on story-games.com suggest this pairing, and it sounded fun! (Plus, I\u2019d always wanted to play the wedding playset, and combining it with zombies seemed to be the most likely way to get it to the table.)<br/><br/>After that, we played Salem 1692, another one I\u2019d been wanting to get to the table for a while. It provided some witchy good fun. That one may take me a bit longer to write-up, but I hope to get it posted soon. In the meantime, here\u2019s the zombie/wedding Fiasco!<br/><br/><b>My Big Fat Zombie Lesbian Wedding</b><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Set-up</b></span><br/><i><b>Regina (me) and Linda </b></i>are getting married. Unfortunately, their happy day is marred by two signs of the apocalypse \u2013- the right-wing mayor\u2019s law that same-sex marriage shall be illegal in the city and a growing zombie epidemic. The archaic law is to go into effect at 5 p.m. that day, so Regina and Linda (and a few daring friends and family members) brave the undead hordes to get their nuptials concluded while they are still relatively legal. One member of the wedding party is Regina\u2019s stoner brother, <i><b>Alan</b></i>, who is serving as her best man and (in typical Alan fashion) has brought the <i><b>wedding rings in a fast-food bag</b></i> (in all fairness to Alan, it\u2019s hard to find \u201cjust the right\u201d ring box when your city is overrun with zombies). Unknown to Regina, Alan also has <b><i>dangerous, deeply conflicted feelings for his sister\u2019s fianc\xe9</i></b>, with whom he\u2019s having an affair. But Alan isn\u2019t the only one with secrets; in truth, he and Regina are two <i><b>equally unstable relatives </b></i>and if and when Regina finds out the truth about Alan and Linda\u2019s affair, she will work <i><b>to get even with the people who  let her down</b></i>.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395172/#Comment_395172" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T16:25:30+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  4:25PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Act 1</b></span><br/>Regina is blissful on her happy day, while Alan and Linda are sneaking kisses in a darkened room off of the chapel. Regina and Alan\u2019s overbearing mother catches the two mid-kiss and demands to know what\u2019s going on. Alan manages to convince his mother that the kiss was just a one-time thing to wish his future sister-in-law good luck. His mother reluctantly agrees to keep quiet.<br/><br/>The ceremony begins. Both brides make their way to the alter amidst the few members of their friends and family members who were willing and able to get through zombie onslaught. Reverend Emmalou Mason reads their vows, which Regina \u2013- of course \u2013- heartily agrees to. <br/><br/>But when it\u2019s Linda\u2019s turn, instead of saying \u201cI do,\u201d she just begins crying and finally says \u201c<b><i>I\u2019m crying because I need to confess something</i></b>.\u201d She looks from Alan to Regina and back to Alan again\u2026 and then faints.<br/><br/>Linda wakes at the alter a short time later surrounded by Regina, Alan, Regina and Alan\u2019s mother, and some others. She is a bit dazed and says nothing about the outburst. Regina suggest that perhaps she just fainted because of the stress of everything \u2013- the wedding, the rush to the alter, the zombies, etc. Linda agrees and asks if she and Regina can speak privately. They go off together to a small room.<br/><br/>As Regina and Linda are on their own, Alan fidgets nervously with the fast-food bag holding the rings. His mother comes over and berates him, wanting to know exactly what is going on between him and Linda. Finally he confesses that he is in love with Linda. <br/><br/>His mother surprises him by saying that she approves of him with Linda, saying something about if Linda has to be part of the family, she\u2019d much prefer it be with her son than her daughter!<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Tilt</b></span><br/>* Guilt \u2013- Someone Panics <br/>* Failure \u2013- A Tiny Mistake Leads to Ruin(full admission \u2013- we did not work this one in very well, though I suppose some of the things that happen could technically refer to this)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395173/#Comment_395173" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T16:29:03+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  4:29PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Act 2</b></span><br/>Regina and Linda are discussing their future. Linda is about to tell the truth about her affair with Alan when suddenly zombies break through the window! They almost ambush the brides, but Regina and Linda manage to get away, barricading the door behind them. They make their way to the chapel, which has also been overrun with zombies! Much of the wedding party has already been bitten and infected. Only a few remain alive and fighting, including Alan, Regina and Alan\u2019s mother, and the Reverend Mason. The zombies are bearing down on all of them. Many of these zombies were recently turned loved ones of Regina. Linda, always prepared, reaches into the skirts of her wedding gown and produces two Colt .45\u2019s, handing one to Regina. \u201cNo!\u201d Regina cries. \u201c<i><b>I don\u2019t care if they\u2019re already dead! I won\u2019t shoot my family!</b></i>\u201d She runs upstairs, leaving Linda to fend for herself.<br/><br/>Alan and his mother try to make their way to Linda, since she actually has gun that might come in handy. Unfortunately, in their attempt to escape, his mother starts to panic, drawing even more zombies over to them. She is dragged away by the monsters. Bits of her flesh are chomped off as she cries out, \u201cAlan! Go on! You marry that gun-crazy lesbian and help your sister find a man who is not a zombie!\u201d (Yes, this is pretty much a direct quote from the game!)<br/><br/>Regina is halfway upstairs when she hears what her mother has shouted to Alan. Why would Alan be marrying a lesbian unless\u2026? And then she puts two and two together. Alan and\u2026 Linda? Her Linda? She shoots her way through several zombies and makes her way back to the chapel determined to get the truth and \u2013- if necessary -\u2013 revenge.<br/><br/>Suddenly there is a <i><b>widespread power outage </b></i>and the lights go out. Zombies start to swarm all over Linda, but Regina comes to her rescue. <br/><br/>\u201cRegina?\u201d Linda asks, relieved. \u201cIs it really you? You\u2019re alive?\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cI\u2019m alive,\u201d says Regina. \u201cAnd so are you. For now.\u201d (I am probably paraphrasing this dialogue a bit, but whatever we actually said, it was equally awesome.)<br/><br/>Alan makes his way in the darkness to Regina and Linda. The lights flicker back on thanks to the church\u2019s generator, and he finds his sister and the woman he loves in a small, zombie-free room. Linda has confessed everything, and she and Regina are back together -\u2013 apparently happier than ever. But that is not the worst thing about Alan\u2019s situation. In that moment, he realizes that in his struggles with the zombies, he was bitten on his arm. The women notice it too and draw their guns. <br/><br/>Alan pleads with them: \u201c<b><i>It\u2019s not too late! Amputate the arm!</i></b>\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cThat\u2019s one way to do it,\u201d Linda says. \u201cHere\u2019s another.\u201d She shoots him in the head and he falls to the ground. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Aftermath</b></span><br/>Regina comes up with a plan to get out of the church, and possibly the city. \u201c<b><i>If we act and smell like them, maybe they won\u2019t notice us.</i></b>\u201d They cover themselves in blood and guts and try to sneak out. It works, and they make their way to a non-infested area. <br/><br/>And eventually, the zombies are hunted down and exterminated. Regina and Linda begin a quiet life together, but it doesn\u2019t last. Linda regrets killing Alan (her true love) and resents Regina for \u201cmaking\u201d her take that action. She sets up a plan to frame her partner for Alan\u2019s murder, and Regina is sent off to prison. But even this form of revenge does not make Linda happy; she spends the rest of her life sad and alone.<br/><br/>Alan, interestingly enough, did not die that day. The bullet entered the side lobe of his brain but did not kill him. In fact, all of the pot he\u2019d smoked had already killed off most of those brain cells long ago, so all it really left him with was a hole in his head. And all of the blood made the zombies leave him alone, so he escaped without further injury. After the zombies were rounded up and destroyed, he went back to his old life of marijuana and fast food. He even ended up hooking up with his other lesbian sister\u2019s fianc\xe9! <br/><br/>Flashback: During the zombie invasion, a female zombie finds the fast-food bag with the wedding rings. She keeps one ring herself and gives the other to another female zombie before they go off to devour some wedding guests. (Just something we added as a tag at the end!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_395190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395190/#Comment_395190" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T18:01:31+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  6:01PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a touching story of true love right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jddennis" title="jddennis"><img alt="jddennis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jddennis">jddennis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395199/#Comment_395199" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-28T19:23:29+00:00" title="October 28, 2012  7:23PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mawwage is what bwings us togevver today!
