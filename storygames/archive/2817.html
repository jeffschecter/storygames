What do I do?"<br/><br/>"Well, what do you want your Ninja to do?"<br/><br/>"I want to sneak into someone's bedroom."<br/><br/>So I deal her four cards, because that's how it works. "Black cards are sneaking and red cards are fighting. So you need three black cards."<br/><br/>And she turns over the cards. Three of them are black. "Hooray!" she says.<br/><br/>"What now?" I say.<br/><br/>"I want to steal something. Can I steal a magic book?"<br/><br/>"Sure. That's another sneaking thing."<br/><br/>I deal four cards again. She turns them and it's one black and three red.<br/><br/>"So the first thing is: you can get rid of one of the cards and I'll give you another."<br/><br/>"There's no point," she says.<br/><br/>"All right. And the second thing is: because you've got three red cards, you can change your mind and do something fighty. Like kill him in his bed."<br/><br/>"I don't want to do that," she says.<br/><br/>"OK. So the <i>third</i> thing is, you can fail. But when you fail, you give away your presence, and that scares them. And you get a Fear point."<br/><br/>"I'll do that."<br/><br/>"OK. So how do you give away your presence?"<br/><br/>"He wakes up the next day and finds his books are all beautifully arranged. So he knows someone's been there."<br/><br/>"So what do you do now?" I ask.<br/><br/>"I guess I go back to my Ninja den."<br/><br/>"What happens?"<br/><br/>"I think I find an intruder there."<br/><br/>"Excellent. What do you do?"<br/><br/>"I kill him."<br/><br/>"OK, that's a fighty thing, so you need three red cards."<br/><br/>I deal four cards. This time, they're all black, and one's the joker.<br/><br/>"All right. So, the first thing is, because you've got three black cards, you can do something sneaky instead of fighty. And the second thing is, because the joker's there, you can do something legendary."<br/><br/>"What's legendary?"<br/><br/>"Just something supernatural, something extraordinary. It costs a Fear point."<br/><br/>"All right. Before he sees me, I whip around him, and he finds there's a net around him, and I hoist him up to the  ceiling."<br/><br/>"OK. What happens then?" I ask.<br/><br/>"I talk to him. He's called Dave." says my girlfriend.<br/><br/>"OK."<br/><br/>"He's from a faction of Ninjas, all called Dave." <br/><br/>"OK. And what do you do?"<br/><br/>"I hunt down the boss, Chief Dave."<br/><br/>"All right, where is he?"<br/><br/>"He's in the sewers under the city. I want to sneak in to get him. Through a manhole."<br/><br/>"All right. Sneaky thing."<br/><br/>I deal four cards, but three of them are red.<br/><br/>"So what happens?"<br/><br/>"I think I get trapped halfway down the manhole and they hear me coming."<br/><br/>"What happens to Chief Dave?"<br/><br/>"He gets away."<br/><br/>I quite like this game, although I need to work on more realistic Japanese Ninja names.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63922/#Comment_63922" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-14T15:57:21+00:00" title="April 14, 2007  3:57PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nah, Dave, Dave san and Dave Sama seperate them all quite nicely.<br/><br/>Do the ninjas do anything that isn't sneaking or fiighting? and secondly is there a way to get more than four cards.<br/><br/>I like the idea that to be in love a ninja has to sneak into it or fight for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63924">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick" title="Andrew Kenrick"><img alt="Andrew Kenrick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/415482171_321214bd7c.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Kenrick">Andrew Kenrick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63924/#Comment_63924" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-14T16:58:22+00:00" title="April 14, 2007  4:58PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2007 4:58PM by Andrew Kenrick.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Considering your girlfriend doesn't roleplay, she's quite good at this whole roleplaying malarkey!<br/><br/>edit: ninjas sounds fun too!

You're <i>hoping</i> for a sneaky success, but if you get three red cards, you can change your mind and turn your sneak into a fight. So you're sneaking past the guard, and he notices you, and before he can cry out you break his neck.<br/><br/>And then it gets interesting when you're trying to sneak and you get three red cards and a black. Do you abandon the sneak, accept the fighty success and break the guard's neck? Or do you risk exchanging two of the red cards, hoping you'll get two black cards and succeed in the sneak: but knowing you could end up with nothing?<br/><br/>I'm making this up as I go along, of course, and I've only just realised it's more interesting to exchange two cards than one.

And not identical to six cards, either.  Now you have interesting choices involves.  Maybe you can discard any number of cards?  Three and four are even more risky, and would only be discarded if you have a total success in the other field.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64180/#Comment_64180" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-17T13:12:45+00:00" title="April 17, 2007  1:12PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That example of play makes me so happy I can hardly stand it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
