Hail IFC!) and found it fascinating. There were some social/psych aspects that kind of weirded me out, but as far as gaming goes, it made me contemplate the following.<br/><br/>If you're heavily invested in your PC, self-identifying with them and/or really becoming them ("getting deep into character"), how are you ever supposed to gain any enjoyment from, say, that character's death? Or even setbacks in general?<br/><br/>I mean, the "Inheritance" scenario for <i>Burning Wheel</i> in which I played is a total blood opera. Almost everyone dies glorious or ignominious deaths at the end... and they have fun doing it. The deaths are a perfect ending to the story. But, BW is one of those indie/hippie games where even the book asserts that your character is just a piece of paper.<br/><br/>Thing is, I don't see how this can be enjoyable if you're not looking at the game from this sort of macro, story-level perspective. If I'm playing the game from the perspective of people like the Darkon players, how is this going to be any fun for me? If my goal is the "be there" and "be in character," all that story-appropriate death means is that I'm a) no longer there, and b) certainly not in character any more, unless I enjoy lying still on the floor.<br/><br/>It reminds me of a guy I used to game with who would get incredibly emotional whenever bad things would happen to his PC. He'd get angry at NPCs, even though it was, of course, the GM who was thwarting his PC via those NPCs. It just seemed crazy to me (and was a factor in why I left that group).<br/><br/>Or, to get back to Darkon, the scene where Skip and his friend are having a heated discussion at Denny's. The friend decided to have his Darkon PC become an evil lich, and Skip is totally pissed at him for it. The friend is literally saying "It's just a game!" Skip refuses to take that as an answer.<br/><br/>Again, I can see your buddy's PC becoming a lich being a really cool story. But if you're so heavily, personally invested that you see everything through the eyes of your PC, and take this as a betrayal... isn't that sucking the fun out of it all?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109369/#Comment_109369" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-23T10:46:51+00:00" title="November 23, 2007 10:46AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No. When viewed solely as continuous gratification fun is vapid.

As game organizer, I am interested in how players feel. So why not just give the player what they want? She'll have fun, we'll all have fun. If her tastes change up the road, they'll change.

How could anyone possibly enjoy that? It makes one afraid, which is a negative emotion, and the characters we care about get slaughtered in evil ways. But it's also cathartic, and it's sometimes a good experience to have these negative feelings.<br/><br/>However, if you go into the movie expecting a wish fulfillment fantasy (like, say, a Steven Seagal movie, or (disappointingly) Live Free or Die Hard), then it would piss you off if your favorite character gets shamed, defeated, killed, etc.<br/><br/>That's one aspect. Of course there's the issue of how you continue playing if your playing piece is removed, but that's an issue not just for immersive players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109395/#Comment_109395" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-23T13:35:31+00:00" title="November 23, 2007  1:35PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>There's a difference between immersive playing and wish fulfillment.

I guess there's nothing wrong with escapism and turning to gaming out of a sense of frustration and disappointment with yourself, but I would have appreciated a more balanced look at the hobby. My point is not that anyone's reason is badwrongfun, its just that the film left the impression that all of them are in the hobby because they hate themselves, live dull lives and are otherwise social outcasts. I'm sure that exists, but clearly the film was biased toward the dramatic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109440/#Comment_109440" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-23T23:55:49+00:00" title="November 23, 2007 11:55PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: buzz</cite>That makes sense.

The game that triggered my massive split was, ta-da!, <i>Burning Wheel</i>. <br/><br/>The game pushes almost every correct button for me, and I'm the only GM in a rotating group of 6-10 players. Several design elements and play philosophies come together in that game (and BE, to a much stronger extent) to produce what I feel is a near-optimal RPG experience.<br/><br/>Half my players agree, and we're enjoying the best gaming in 25 years.<br/><br/>Half my players disagree so strongly that they have withdrawn from the group and refuse to even discuss roleplaying with us 'til we drop Burning-anything and get on with something, <i>anything</i>, else.<br/><br/>The following is strictly my own theory and is probably both inaccurate and incomplete.<br/><br/>The hater-half just isn't wired to be able to see the story side of the game. They want immersion and achieve it easily; so easily, in fact, that they experience a lot of anguish when I put their characters through the wringer. Unfortunately, since it's me, the GM, inflicting the anguish on the players/characters, they take it personally. Why are you punishing meeeee? <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the story-focused half is climbing over one another to get another piece of that delicious high-drama spotlight time they feel I'm squandering on the half that wants a string of tactically interesting and visually intense combat scenes.<br/><br/>It's a real problem, because this is the first time I've ever had a situation where players' mutually incompatible needs were so clearly highlighted. Once I wrap up my current <i>Blossoms are Falling</i> game, we're gonna need to take a little break and play something else.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_109456">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109456/#Comment_109456" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T07:13:53+00:00" title="November 24, 2007  7:13AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>Perhaps you shouldn't project your personal desire to limit subject matter onto what experiences games should provide for everyone.</blockquote>\nUm....and where did I do that exactly?<br/><br/>In my first post I said it drove me crazy for a while until I hit my forehead with my hand and said 'duh!' and stopped trying to change it, and everyone was much happier for it.  I can completely understand why it would drive someone crazy.  Its only because of the preferences of my group that I could hit my forehead and yell 'duh' and stop worrying about it.

I give setbacks and problems to some characters and not to others.  And I certainly don't handle Very Serious Things in my games.  And everyone is happy with that because of the mix of preferences we have.  The "problem" that made me so frustrated is still there, but it is simply no longer a problem and I am no longer frustrated.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_109464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/109464/#Comment_109464" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-24T09:28:53+00:00" title="November 24, 2007  9:28AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 24, 2007 9:30AM by noclue.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>You don't call real life deeply personal?</blockquote>\nMalcolm, is that a rhetorical question?

Like Matt, I was kind of put off to see so many of the interviews focus on how much these people are dissatisfied with their lives and look to Darkon for fulfillment. Not that this is inherently bad, to a degree; I certainly have more fun at game sessions than I typically do at work. But part of me is a little tired of seeing the mass media focus on this one aspect of roleplaying.<br/><br/>(There was an IFC interview with the producers and Skip after the film. My TiVo cut most of it off, but at one point the director was making some larger point about Darkon exemplifying America withdrawing into itself... and he was sitting right next to Skip!)<br/><br/>Not to mention, another part of me wanted to ask these people why they weren't bettering their situations instead of investing so much effort in Darkon. Granted, Skip's history with his brother and the family company is pretty rough, and the single mom certainly had a lot of obstacles in her way. I.e., I'm sympathetic, but I was still thinking this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
