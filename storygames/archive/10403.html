I was totally kicking myself that i hadn't gotten a tracking number at the post office,<br/>and though i have three more copies with me, i want to give them to people who are kind to me on the road (as that <br/>i'm travelling right now). I've been checking my email, expecting a no-show, so i'm glad that the Smoke Dream has<br/>finally come to Guadalajara. Plus THE POSTAL SYSTEM isn't keeping you waiting. <br/><br/>So yeah, man, please tell of your experiences! Play well, and don't let The Master Bedroom grind you down! (little U2 refference there, for the faithful)<br/><br/><br/>Matt: There has been some success on that front, the two playtester-friends mentioned in the text played it on the floor of a waiting room,<br/>teamed with a third friend, carefully discussing each move to be made. They (and others: Mattijs, Christian) report enjoying the shared puzzling.<br/>Please, tell me how you and your co-player arrange this specifically between you. I'm freakishly interested.<br/><br/>Matthew, Colin, other interested parties: On our green earth, i currently know of the following unaffilliated-with-buyer copies of the smoke dream:<br/>3 copies in my backpack. X copies in the hands of Joe Mcdonald, where X is less than or equal to 5. also, 25 as-yet unbound copies at my home in<br/>olympia, washington (where i will be returning at end-of-the-month).<br/>unless there is an emergency (you're injured and in hospital and need a copy of the Smoke Dream to occupy your brain and keep your imagination<br/>from rusting shut), the 3 with me are unavailable, i want to give them to people i meet. I will be gathering the copies from Joe before too long, but you<br/>can certainly contact him about sending them to you- do something really nice for him, like taking some photos for that photo project of his or posting<br/>and Actual Play account for his game Ribbon Drive, as that i'll only be buying him a slice of pizza in thanks for whatever work you make him do, and that<br/>doesn't seem sufficient. <br/>If you can wait, i'll send out copies in early october, after i sew up the 25 copies. (Already there are a few set to fly to Denmark upon my return-<br/>how is it that i envy the travel that my game books experience?)<br/><br/>Joe, thanks for having my back.<br/><br/><br/>And i've been playing too, every day for the last three days, taking over the kitchen table and trying to convince The Waif to join<br/>my party. She's a hard one to find, however. Best of Luck, Omar and the others!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231585/#Comment_231585" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-11T08:15:39+00:00" title="September 11, 2009  8:15AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 11, 2009 8:17AM by ColinC.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Got your e-mail, Jackson.
