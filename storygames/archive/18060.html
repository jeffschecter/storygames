I'm looking to join or build a game group  and  generally meet folks interested in RPGs and other fun games.  <br/>I live in Silverdale, near the Kitsap County mall.  Bremerton and Poulsbo are nearby, but if anyone's interested in options within an hour's drive... I'm open!<br/><br/>I've played many games.  Mostly interested in RPGs, but also play various mini games, card games, and board games.  <br/>I can join a group to play,  or look to build a new group  and  love GameMastering as well.  And I can host games at my apartment if the group likes.  I also have a roommate, who's been a longtime friend and player interested in gaming as well.  <br/><br/>From D&amp;D to Call of Cthulhu,  from Exalted to All Flesh Must Be Eaten,  from StarWars to Shadowrun, superheroes, Deadlands,  and  dozens of other mainstream and indie games.  From Warhammer to HeroClix,  from Magic the Gathering to Settlers of Catan.  I'm looking to find a group  and  get into a great campaign  and  regular game group.<br/><br/><br/>Any interest for options?<br/>Kevin<br/>kevperrine@gmail.com<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC" title="KingstonC"><img alt="KingstonC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/KingstonC">KingstonC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407906/#Comment_407906" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-03T20:16:17+00:00" title="March  3, 2013  8:16PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also live in Kitsap.
