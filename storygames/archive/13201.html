But I suppose the only reason I thought that was because IaWA is already fantasy-oriented, and there's no clear reason (at least not to me) why one game would be more suited to a particular setting than the other.<br/><br/>So, supposing you're about to sit down to write your own oracle or playset,<br/>* is the question pointless?  Is the reason to play IaWA vs. Fiasco because of your taste or mood ("I want GMless!" or "I want more crunch!"), irrespective of setting?<br/>or<br/>* is there really something about Fiasco that makes it suitable to modern settings whereas IaWA is really what you want for magic and supernatural stuff?<br/><br/>And what about science fiction?

Fiasco works great for fantasy (as you'll see in December!), as long as it is "incompetence porn" fantasy. I think it does that very well, but that's all it does. Both games can embrace a variety of tone and tenor, but IAWA offers a lot of latitude in theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297255/#Comment_297255" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T13:05:01+00:00" title="October 18, 2010  1:05PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a question of tone, myself - IaWA seems less primed for humorous stories than Fiasco, and a great deal of Dwarf Fortress is supposed to be some combination of chuckle-worthy and absurd.<br/><br/>For that matter, I am going to agree with Jason and say that Fiasco can do fantasy, too. But the reverse doesn't work - I don't think IaWA could do much more than shift into a related genre (science fantasy, for instance) without having to be completely broken down and rebuilt. <br/><br/>If, on the other hand, you just like the Oracles, or the conflict resolution, of IaWA, you could use it (and people have), but it's going into serious hack territory at this point, as opposed to using IaWA as-is. Fiasco is genre-neutral, more or less, with an emphasis on how conflicts should unfold (bigger and bigger stakes, absurd left turns), and it does seem to help if you enjoy a bit of kitsch. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there are some playsets that seem kitsch-free (Southern Reconstruction comes to mind), so it really does seem to be wide open.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_297260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297260/#Comment_297260" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-18T13:40:56+00:00" title="October 18, 2010  1:40PM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite> I don't think IaWA could do much more than shift into a related genre (science fantasy, for instance) without having to be completely broken down and rebuilt.</blockquote>\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6038" rel="nofollow">Nah,</a> that's <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Vista_Heights_Oracle" rel="nofollow">not true.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/297340/#Comment_297340" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-19T06:49:31+00:00" title="October 19, 2010  6:49AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Surface setting elements (dwarves, elves etc.) Are less important than the story structures a game creates.

Fiasco has precisely three points (albeit with major impact, at those points).<br/>* Character mechanics - IAWA actually HAS characters mechanics, Fiasco doesn't. If you want mechanical efficacy or a character's measurable competence to impact the narrative, IAWA does it. Fiasco's impacts are all by freeform narration/fiat/consensus.<br/>* Supernatural - IAWA's Particular Strengths play to a supernatural angle better than even a "supernatural" playset in Fiasco, in part (again) because of the character mechanics, not just a relationship to something supernatural (or a supernatural-ish role in a PC-to-PC relationship, like "members of a black cult").\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Zac in Davis</cite>But the reverse doesn't work - I don't think IaWA could do much more than shift into a related genre (science fantasy, for instance) without having to be completely broken down and rebuilt.</blockquote>Just not true, as Jason (JD) mentioned above. I've run IAWA for a bunch of Shadowrun heads who'd never heard of a "story game," and we used the default Oracles but modernized their interpretations (e.g. "an inn" become "a motel"). Worked just fine, though one player's Particular Strength was tricky to use in more than one way (i.e. he thought "super power" not "arena of competence").<br/><br/>Could IAWA run a Fiasco-like game? Sure, with the right Oracles. But the lack of freeform narration and the more-adversarial triggers for mechanics ("Oh, no, you fucking don't, asshole") will shape the fiasco into a particular type--a Reservoir Dogs game is more likely than a Fargo game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_297438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
