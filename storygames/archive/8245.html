Being a game collector and having played Magic in the past, I said sure. He gave me a case of cards, some pre-constructed decks, but most just lose cards packed into shoe boxes. These are from the first three sets (I think they are on 9th or 10th edition now?) and I doubt there is much in the way of monetary value, but still, it seems like a shame to lets these hundreds of cards just sit in a box doing nothing.<br/><br/>So short of building decks of antiquated cards, help me figure out some creative things to do with these. Is there a way I could use them in another game? A cool arts and crafts project? Clip them to the spokes on my bike? Anything?<br/><br/>Any advice would be appreciated.<br/><br/>ME<br/><br/>Edit: I said they were from the first three sets, but to be honest I don't know that for sure. I showed some of the cards to people at my office today who have played the game, and they said they were from all different sets. I plan on going through them more carefully tonight (there probably are 1,000 or more cards, easily) to look for some key cards to set aside and look up values online.

My idea was similar Jonathan's: a big map made up of Lands, which you would conquer in order to access their mana. In the large scale, it was like a game of Diplomacy, in the small scale battles were played out as games of M:tG.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of dealing with the cards more literally. For example, you might designate a particular Mountain as being the home of the Minotaurs. Only the person controlling that land could call on the Minotaurs for help during a M:tG match.<br/><br/>I also considered that the further away a land was from your current location, the more expensive or difficult it would be to draw on its mana or resources (like the Minotaurs).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181511/#Comment_181511" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T09:47:37+00:00" title="December  4, 2008  9:47AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part Two:<br/><br/>I think how I would do this part would be to make huge decks of each colour. Then, for each appropriate Land that you control, you draw a number (10?) of cards from the appropriate deck. You would use the sum of those cards to build your personal battle deck.<br/><br/>So, for instance, if you won two Swamps from an opponent, you would draw 20 cards from the Black deck, and add whichever ones you wanted, in whatever proportion, to your deck. If you lost a Mountain territory, you'd have to remove 10 Red cards from your deck, and so on and so forth.<br/><br/>You would interact with the other players (all powerful wizards and warlords) by fighting them, negotiating them, offering and trading them resources (whether cards, territories, or something else).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181518/#Comment_181518" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-04T10:02:26+00:00" title="December  4, 2008 10:02AM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Take out a selection of cards you like, maybe just a deck of 60 or so.</p>\n<p>Look at them every day.

I'll use this card for explanatory purposes:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v20/frostwinterheim/DrizztDoUrden.jpg"/><br/><br/>* Get a 1" deep clear card box.<br/>* Get several copies of the same card (he did it with commons, at a time when a full box of Jyhad boosters could be bought for $5).<br/>* Cut out the entire art box--this will be the top-most card in a stack of cards with more and more of the artwork left uncut.<br/>* Cut out all background image elements, leaving only foreground elements--this is the next card down. On the above, you'd only leave the swords and orc arms at the image bottom.<br/>* Continue removing progressively less background at each "layer":<br/>--- leave the above and the orc on the left with his spear broken (and the spear tip by itself)<br/>--- leave all of the above and Drizzt<br/>--- leave all of the above and the rock at his back, with his shadow on it<br/>* Finally, the "bottommost" card would has the full art.<br/>* Glue each card together into a stack, separating them with a bit of (hidden) cardboard.<br/>* Put the stack of cards with in the clear box and glue it shut (or not).<br/><br/>Voila! A bit of Exacto knife work, and you've got a very cool shadow box of one of your favorite cards. The guy got, IIRC, about $10 each for them... for maybe five cards worth less than a penny each and a $1 card box and some time.

Give 'em a card that represents the item. Who cares about the stats on the card, it's the visual thing you're after. Although there's nothing stopping you from doing your own custom cards either, but that's a whole other topic.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're thinking of doing some sort of rpg thingy... there's a few folks that have already taken a stab at it:<br/>\n<br/>\nManaburn:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://ruscumag.wordpress.com/other-games/" rel="nofollow">http://homepage.mac.com/whymme/ManaBurn/index.html</a><br/>\n<br/>\nMagebane:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://ruscumag.wordpress.com/other-games/" rel="nofollow">http://mindseye_x.tripod.com/</a><br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the one that I find most intriguing:<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://ruscumag.wordpress.com/other-games/" rel="nofollow">http://ruscumag.wordpress.com/other-games/</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_181836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus" title="Scurvy_Platypus"><img alt="Scurvy_Platypus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scurvy_Platypus">Scurvy_Platypus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181836/#Comment_181836" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-05T23:14:32+00:00" title="December  5, 2008 11:14PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2008 11:18PM by Scurvy_Platypus.">edited December 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">Here's an idea someone has done with Jyhad (Vampire: the Eternal Struggle) cards: shadow box art.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nSo, there's some folks that have messed around with what David is talking about. His explanation doesn't quite do it justice though. So, I'm going to provide a few links that should help explain just how cool this really is.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, here's a tutorial.

If you study the pictures closely, you'll see that instead of simply slapping the Ogre on there exactly the same way, he actually cut out and built up specific parts of it. That's what helps to give it the very nice 3D look that some of the others are missing. For example, in the first picture of the ogre, you can see how the sword is actually built up slightly over the arm. You can also see how the head has been built up separately. The buildups look like they were done mostly at the last stages to help establish the depth of the character. Very slick.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_181892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle" title="JCunkle"><img alt="JCunkle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JCunkle">JCunkle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/181892/#Comment_181892" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-06T15:35:56+00:00" title="December  6, 2008  3:35PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could use them for IAWA oracles.

I'd like to unpack that a little bit.<br><br>Take a look at your standard MtG card, you've got:<br>- The card name<br>- The artwork<br>- The casting cost<br/>- The type<br/>- For a creature, the offense and defense values<br/>- The rules text<br/>- The flavor text<br/><br/>Any and all of these elements can act as constraints or inspirations for narration. <br/><br/>Start with an extremely simple freeform game using MtG cards. I play a card and narrate what it is in the fiction. You do the same. We keep going until some kind of story is resolved.<br/><br/>We decide that the artwork literally depicts the narration. That's a creative constraint, and also a source of story inspiration. How can we use other elements in this way?<br/><br/>We could decide that the offense and defense are also narrative constraints. If I play an Ogre, it's already given within the fiction that he's stronger than your elf because the Ogre has a higher number. We could decide the color means something. Perhaps I can only narrate violence if I play a card that has red in it. Maybe playing a white card lets me narrate some kind of healing, refreshment, or source of hope or redemption.<br/><br/>I think this gets really cool when you start looking at some other games. The Dune CCG has icons on each card that correspond to the different kinds of conflict that the culture of the Dune world recognizes - a clear tie between the mechanics on the card and the game world. We've been playing a lot of Race for the Galaxy lately. Each card has a clear indication of which aspects of the epic sci-fi story they correspond to (exploration, conquestion, trade, and so on). I have a few cards from a now defunct CCG for teenage girls called "boy crazy" or some such blather. Each card features a hunk of a boy, including his hobbies, interests, and so on. That's just begging to be made into "boy crazy fight club" or something like that.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
