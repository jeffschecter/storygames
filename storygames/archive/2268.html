                    Hey,<br/><br/>Any of you who are coming in super-early, I would like to invite you to sign up for the playtest of my game, Misspent Youth: A Game of Juvenile Delinquency and Being Awesome.  This would be the third playtest and I think the game is humming pretty well right now.  It's a sci-fi game that focuses on rebellion, friendship, and the temptation of using The Man's tools against him.  It's R101 (the first roleplaying game on the schedule!), and I hope to see you there.  If you have any questions about the game, let me know.  Here's the blurb:<br/><br/>R101: "Misspent Youth: A Game of Juvenile Deliquency and Being Awesome" by Rob Bowell. An INDEPENDENTLY PUBLISHED GAME from Dog-eared Designs - Part of the Indie Games Explosion! It's 10 years in the future and The Authority is out to crush you, everyone you love. The adults won't do anything about it, the other kids are sheep. Only you and your crew will stand up. Misspent Youth is a story game including collaborative world creation, fluid and easy-to-remember rules, and kickass adventure. NOTE: This is a playtest of a forthcoming game. Thursday, 8:00PM - 12:00AM; One Round; All Materials Provided. Beginners Welcome; Fun, Under 18 Requires Parental Clearance.<br/><br/>Crap.  I just realized for some reason the company is listed as Dog-Eared Designs.  I'll get them to fix that right now.                </div>

                            Krista and I might play again, depending on whether we actually go Thursday night or not. Since I couldn't take Friday off, it's almost a waste for me.                        </div>

                            I'm sorry I can't be there for that, Rob.  I'm really curious to see how the game flies with the new craps mechanics.<br/><br/>The game we set up over holiday break was intriguing and I'm curious to see how it plays.<br/><br/>Good luck.                        </div>

                            Thanks guys, both of you.  Andrew, I hope I get to see you and Krista again playing this.  The game is so much better than it was.<br/><br/>Last night I went to Kinkos and I now have a 2-foot-long "table."                        </div>
