I'm a huge new-games whore. This isn't judgement, just observation.<br/><br/>For me, when evaluating a new game, I know I look for a few things that are so ingrained into my experience that their absence is jarring. Like, we're about to start a Technoir game, right? I'm playing not running, so I've only flipped through the book. But the two things that jumped out at me were:<br/><br/>* The game really doesn't care what your character's goals, beliefs, values, whatever. There's no measure, as far as I can tell, of his internal space. Or at least no heavy mechanical/economic tie to pursuing personal ambitions.<br/><br/>* No way for players to bring in their own NPCs<br/><br/>Of course these "absences" are totally a result of too damned much Burning Wheel exposure. Those two items always, always feel "missing" to me whenever we play anything that's not that: AW, Inspectres, Dogs, whatever. Getting my head to accept the game on its own terms means, for me, getting past that "where the heck are those rules?" feeling.<br/><br/>What elements do you go looking for?

I'm like the mirror you, from badwrongfun land!  j/k<br/><br/>I've been running a lot of Technoir, so I'll use your example as contrast. You're absolutely right in that there's no direct, obvious mechanical tie to a PC's inner space. I like this about the game, and it's a feature I appreciate in other games as well. Character stuff (goals, personality, fictional positioning, etc.) is something I prefer as an emergent property of play. Maybe that comes from playing primarily D&amp;D for so long, not sure. Having to front-load all that stuff before play makes me think two things, "We could be playing right now omg this is taking so long" and "You don't even know this character yet and are going to want to change everything you just wrote about them fifteen minutes into the first session anyway".<br/><br/>So yeah, while I don't mind a little bit of pre-play "this is who my guy is and this is what he wants, and so on..", I far prefer games that leave room for that to emerge primarily through play. It occurs to me that Psi*Run does this in an excellent way while still pointing you in a direction with your Questions that you need to answer.<br/><br/>To use Technoir again, yeah, there's no direct mechanism for players to insert NPCs or create setting or have much ownership of that stuff at all. Which, theoretically I have no problem with, but I'm usually playing with folks who appreciate having some ownership over those things. Also, as a GM, I find players are usually more invested in the game if they've had a hand in creating some of the setting and NPCs. So for this current round of Technoir play I had the players help me build a custom Transmission. One side-effect of that I think is that the players are introducing more setting elements during play than in previous games of Technoir that I've GM'd.<br/><br/>So I do look for games that have hooks that will help build player investment in the setting, or I look for ways within the existing structure of a game to provide that myself.<br/><br/>Those are probably the two features I look for in a game primarily, and notice most when they're not present. My biggest problem is usually a game having too many rules and too much structure instead of feeling that something is missing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358078/#Comment_358078" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-06T15:01:03+00:00" title="February  6, 2012  3:01PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat!

Such a bully. :-( A thousand apologies if it came off that way -- having an eight-week-old in the house isn't bringing out the "best" in me, either in person or online. <br/><br/>I noticed the same thing about Technoir. And I think you're right that a good part of this phenomenon I'm feeling is where the rules don't cover stuff I'm used to having rules for. <br/><br/>I'm not running Technoir so I have no idea what it says about stuff not covered by the rules. Now you've got me curious.<br/><br/>Now! Back to AW! :-D I think the whole "flag what you want to focus on" component that I feel like is missing from AW is missing precisely because it's not explicit. I guess, maybe, you could extrapolate what the players think about via the moves they pick as the game goes on. But it's very old-school, I think, in not making those kinds of flags explicit. It's all very indirect and -- while I still do very much enjoy the game! -- guessing at player flags/priorities in AW really feels no different than guessing at player flags in D&amp;D. I took a fighter, does that mean I want to fight or does that mean I want to not be hurt? I took a Gunlugger, does that mean I want people to be afraid of me or does that mean I want to succeed in combat? Dunno.<br/><br/>Bringing in NPCs, too, kind of depends on the playbook. Some let you do that, some don't.

I'm just fuckin' with ya, no worries.<br/><br/>I'm actually talking about something completely different in AW. There's little mechanical weight for those two things, but they are all over the MC section.<br/><br/>One of the principles is: "Ask provocative questions and build on the answers."<br/><br/>So, most of the examples of questions throughout the book are "what do you do?" Emphasis on "do"--it's all action. But wait! What about the psychic maelstrom? If we go to page 204, we have questions like "Who was your first kiss?" and "Are you happy?" Many of the Hx connections are also implicit questions about trust and intimate feelings.<br/><br/>And secondly, there are the various moves that allow players to ask the GM and other players about their inner feelings. "What is your character really feeling?" "What are your character's secret pains?" "What's wrong with this and how might I fix it?" "What makes you feel beautiful?" etc. These can not only be turned against the PC on a miss, but the answers can be used as leverage for a manipulation attempt.<br/><br/>As well, the principle says "build on them." Coupled with the bloody fingerprints, the answers to these questions are always opportunities for the GM to (re)introduce meaningful content into the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358361/#Comment_358361" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-08T13:55:17+00:00" title="February  8, 2012  1:55PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As for how that relates to goals and motivations, one of the read a person questions is 'What does your character intend to do now?" Another is "what does your character wish I'd do?" These are both about motivation, and can be turned back on the player. The answers can be short-term or long-term. While the player doesn't get any reward from revealing or pursuing the answers, the act of revealing them allows NPCs to act on them, and either support or oppose them, and so the setting starts to circle around the protagonists.<br/><br/>For the second, one, introducing NPCs is actually pretty easy for players in AW. It's just not made explicit, so I think there's some hesitation on the part of many players to do it. Maybe we are used to responding to the GM's prompting? Or to address only the material that the GM introduces?<br/><br/>In any case, I have noted that the MC section and 1st Session section imply that characters are living in a familiar environment.<br/><br/>Like, page 109 says it's the players job to say what their characters <i>remember</i>, exclusively, "and to answer your questions about their characters' lives and surroundings."<br/><br/>Combine that with "Ask questions like crazy" on page 127, which says to turn questions around and ask the players: "where DO you get your food?" If I as a player am going to really answer this question, I am probably going to have to invent an NPC or two. And it's not really the MC's job to veto what I say, just to add bloody fingerprints to it, make it not boring <i>now</i>, and see what my character does about it.<br/><br/>The other indication of familiarity is "address the characters" and "name the NPCs." Those two together imply that either people in the apocalypse are really good at introducing themselves, or that the PCs know everybody already. And if the PCs know somebody already, the MC can say what they're generally like, but, going back to page 109, not what the PCs feel about them or remember about them. So it's in the MC's best interest to just ask one of the PCs what they think of this guy who just got introduced. So that's a second way for the players to introduce elements of NPCs.<br/><br/><br/>And yes, like you mentioned, playbooks. If you have personnel, you should have a say in who they are, or course.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_358367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358367/#Comment_358367" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-08T14:37:11+00:00" title="February  8, 2012  2:37PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2012 2:49PM by Khimus.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I too felt it weird to start GMing AW after a long campaign of Mouse Guard. I\xb4d think: ok, X reads Y, asks him what\xb4s he really feeling, what\xb4s keeping Y\xb4s player from saying later "no, he doesn\xb4t feel like that anymore". Or the same with important people for the characters. If X\xb4s player says Gum\xb4s his best friend, then later kills him without hesitation, the mechanics in AW don\xb4t stress the relevance of that act (like, maybe, in mouse guard if your goal was to protect him, there\xb4s a mechanical push built in the situation).<br/>But then I started GMing it. First of all, players tend to take seriously what they\xb4ve said about their characters: if they care about X, if they really want Y, etc. But I learnt that AW\xb4s not so suited for flagging issues like BW/MG-beliefs "My honor besides everything" or "Better to be alive than to win a war" or even goal beliefs "I want to overthrow Mani and be the new lord". The players are free to run their characters as they want, so those things are rarely the source of significant play.<br/>What I really feel is the premise, the core of AW, is this: you\xb4re an individual of significant power, but you can\xb4t live on your own, you live within a tight community in danger: anarchy (or chaos) and scarcity. <b>What will you do with that?</b><br/>That is for me the core "flag" around which AW is built. The players can\xb4t dodge that issue, whatever their characters do, it is relevant. If they embrace chaos and kill everybody, if they wish to emerge as the new leaders, if they care only about protecting their group, etc., they are influencing the outcome, because the characters have such power that their actions will always be important. And the consequences of all this are both fictional and mechanical.<br/>Does this make sense?<br/><br/>I feel that AW is a more focused game than BW, because in AW the flagged is broadly built into the game itself, whereas in BW the players create flags for the GM to use. There are, obviously, other things which the GM should use in AW: people PCs directly depend upon (the supplier, the crew, etc.), people PCs care about (because players said it or PCs demonstrate that during play), things the player says or thinks about his character (like goals or personality), etc. But all that is more loosely handled: by the GM asking questions like crazy, by the moves themselves, and of course the GM taking note of every important thing during play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elegua" title="elegua"><img alt="elegua" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elegua">elegua</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358374/#Comment_358374" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-08T15:44:26+00:00" title="February  8, 2012  3:44PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 8, 2012 3:45PM by elegua.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I think that, if you play a certain way over a long enough period, those habits become so ingrained that doing something different can feel like there's something missing.</blockquote>\nI think this was more prescient than perhaps was intended and it helps me to answer the question of what I find 'missing' in a system.<br/><br/>When I play, I bring to the experience a huge pile of baggage about what I prefer, what sort of experience I hope to have, what I tihnk has worked in the past. This all exists before I even try to understand the framework the system is asking me to work under. It is only then that the system tries to bend my will toward what it is trying to accomplish. It does this first by drawing my attention to certain things that it believes are important, perhaps by asking me to write exposition or determine some value for later comparison. The system also might warn me away from certain activities such as narrating for another player. However, no system seems to be able to (nor do I think it should even attempt to) describe in complete detail how to play, and thus there are always great big holes which I and my companions fill with our own expectations.<br/><br/>The expectation which tends to screw up most of the play that I have participated in is the idea that if there isn't a rule for it, you can't do it. This is a completely normal and natural way of approaching things, as we can't expect that any instruction will be able to enumerate everything you are forbidden from doing. The problem comes from the fact that any system has many underlying presumptions and no-matter how fastidious the designer may be, a great many presumptions will be left unstated. Sometimes I can infer these, particularly because I have some exposure to other information, but quite frequently I am left to my own devices. I have found that the best way here is to simply take a damn the torpedos attitude and fill in where I think things are missing and I usually am satisfied with the result.<br/><br/>Sometimes I am not happy with the result, and that's when I get annoyed that something is missing. There might be parts of the instruction which guide me to try doing things very differently than I am accustomed and that might lead me down a path for which I don't know how to return on my own and I have no guide from the designer. This isn't to be confused with situations where I think the design simply made poor decisions and asked me to focus on things that don't work for me and ignore things that do.<br/><br/>Regarding the concerns about what appears in a system such as in BW and is not specifically stated in AW, it seems to me that these are games which focus on very different things. Play in AW is fast and hot with most of the attention paid to the moment and very little paid to the place of the moment in a greater arc. It measures its success on how good a session is. BW is trying to tell stories with a little more distance and measures its success by how well a character's story integrates across a broader tapestry. Not that each system can't accomplish the success of the other, but the amount of effort each of the systems puts into guiding different behaviors is evident.<br/><br/>For me, it all boils down to trying to understand the intent of the design and choosing how much I want to let it influence me and how much I want to override. It has helped that I have an idea of what already works for me, but I am open to the possibility that different experiences could also be enjoyable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
