This is a barely disguised file-off-the-serial-numbers version that moves the action from steampunk-Firefly and brings it into the WW3 in Poland from the 80s RPG Twilight: 2000.<br/><br/>The characters were:<br/>-Natasha Syri, Lady "Twilight" Blackbird: A Polish noble in disguise, escaping an arranged marriage to a warlord so she can be with her lover.<br/>-Dudley Bishop: Former British commando who escaped from Soviet slavers and is now bodyguard to Lady Blackbird<br/>-Cyrus Vance: Ex-U.S. Army captain turned smuggler and soldier-of-fortune, commander of The Owl.<br/>-Kale Arkam: Once a petty criminal, now second-in-command and gunner/mechanic of The Owl.<br/>-Elektryk: A slightly-crazy Polish ex-private and driver of The Owl.<br/><br/>The Owl changed from a Firefly-esqe skyship into an "old but reliable ex-U.S. Army <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAV_25" rel="nofollow">LAV-25</a> armored car, outfitted for smuggling".<br/><br/>We had four players, so the only one left over was Dudley, who I played as an NPC. Based on my previous playings of Lady Blackbird, I encouraged LB and Cyrus Vance to be PCs to keep that tension going.<br/><br/>After a quick overview of the rules, I gave the players a rundown of the situation, which was largely rewritten from John's excellent intro to LB:<br/><br/>Twilight Blackbird is on the run and desperate to get away. She hired a mercenary alcohol-fueled armored car, nicknamed The Owl, to take her from her warlord husband's encampment in Lipno to the free city of Krakow, so she could be with her secret lover, the Pirate of the Vistula, Czeslaw "The Elf" Zielewicz.<br/><br/>However--just before reaching the halfway point of Plock, The Owl was pursued and captured by the armored column of a rival warlord, Kruk Darda.<br/><br/>Even now Lady Blackbird, her bodyguard and the crew of The Owl are detained in the warlord's encampment, while Kruk's gang looks over their papers. It's only a matter of time before they discover the truth and learn that The Owl is owned by none other than the infamous brigand and ex-U.S. soldier Cyrus Vance.<br/><br/>We had three major scenes in the session:<br/><br/>1. The group escapes from the basement of a ruined house in this desolate town by convincing the Polish ex-soldiers guarding them that they were going to miss out on some sex action with their disguised "woman". After a uncomfortable LB acted like she was being raped, Dudley crushed one soldier's windpipe while the other was garroted. War-torn Poland is not a pleasant place to be.<br/><br/>2. Alone in town at nightfall and looking in vain for their vehicle, the group trades a found teapot to a small group of wild kids in exchange for showing them where The Owl is. The warlord's vehicles are arranged in a defensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagon_fort" rel="nofollow">laager</a> with 30-40 armed marauders camping in the center. And The Owl is chained to the back of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP-2" rel="nofollow">BMP</a><br/><br/>3. Three members of the group advance stealthily while two brazenly walk into camp, wearing uniforms and carrying AKs they took from the soldiers they killed. The two create a "diversion" by walking up to the alcohol still (gasoline is almost gone in this world, so vehicles run on ethyl alcohol), and proceed to puncture and set it ablaze. All of this while the other three sneak into The Owl.<br/><br/>Cue explosion, AK fire, backing The Owl into camp and T-boning a BMP to knock a gunner off his aim. Fun stuff all!<br/><br/>(next post will contain player comments and questions)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213565/#Comment_213565" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-19T23:40:42+00:00" title="June 19, 2009 11:40PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued from last post)<br/><br/>At the end of the session, I did a PTA-style "next episode on Twilight Blackbird" and got some great ideas for bangs and pieces of color for next session.<br/><br/>Player comments from our discussion:<br/>-Liked the freeform style of play (GM: I gave them a lot of rope and we created content on the fly)<br/>-Wanted to check out the PC conditions (GM: they didn't fail a roll the entire session)<br/>-Perhaps limit the number of personal dice that can be added to a roll?<br/>-Feels like you need to "justify your dice" to bring them into a roll. (GM: which is true; LB plays like Burning Wheel in that regard)<br/>-Wants to see the GM describe things more (GM: I was relying on the players a lot to describe scenes and what was around them)<br/>-Suggestion: the less dice you throw in, the faster your intent happens? This is a form of hedging your bets.<br/><br/>I believe Matthew later suggested that your failures are narrated along with your successes. So for instance if you needed 4 successes and you gathered 12 dice (which is kind of overkill), you run the risk of having the GM narrate 8 failure dice if you just make your 4 successes.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed running this hack of John's LB game.<br/><br/>I found again that having 4-5 players at the table makes most rolls easy to accomplish. I'm thinking about either ratcheting most conflicts up one dice, or experimenting with what Matthew was describing above. I definitely want some challenge at the table, and I think my players would agree.<br/><br/>What do you all think about the potential rule change?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213579/#Comment_213579" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T07:15:05+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  7:15AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't comment on the rules tweaks but I love the setting port!

I scratched it out because I didn't want associations with that awful teen-vampire crap. But now you have given "twilight" an awesome connotation, so it's all good.<br/><br/>We've had a good mix of success and failure in our LB games, so I haven't given much thought to tweaking the system. I'm a hard ass about helping, though (shouting to someone across the room? not even close), and I often make someone spend their whole action helping -- i.e. they don't do anything else for that chunk of time.<br/><br/>Feel free to increase the difficulty levels. WWIII blasted Poland is a tougher place than the Wild Blue, so starting out at difficulty 4 and going up from there might be just fine.<br/><br/>The idea of the GM narrating something with the failed dice is interesting. I'm talking to Ben Robbins right now about doing something similar in <i>Danger Patrol</i>. I really like the notion that adding dice helps you succeed, but they also increase your risk (kind of like adding dice for dangers in the Otherkind-dice mechanic). Something to experiment with, probably.<br/><br/>Thanks for the AP, Chris.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_213638">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moleculo" title="moleculo"><img alt="moleculo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/874/n4G37MA34HKP8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moleculo">moleculo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213638/#Comment_213638" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T14:43:47+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  2:43PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great session, Chris. It was loads of fun and a great mix of players (nod to Dale, Mac &amp; Jason). <br/><br/>One thing worth mentioning was our final getaway roll to break out of the laager was a difficulty 6... and Dale had 15 dice after it was all said and done to throw at it. We knew it would be a cakewalk and that significantly reduced the tension until he rolled a boatload of crap and we barely made our six. We all howled at that and Chris made us each narrate our part, telling how we barely pulled it off by the skin of our teeth. Made for a fantastic ending despite the initial feeling of overkill dice. I later considered how f#cked we would have been if Chris then narrated <i>nine dice worth of failure</i> on top of our measly six successes. That dynamic would force players to think again about trying to throw every remotely reasonable die at each challenge.<br/><br/>I want to hear Mac's rationale for how the tag of "Engine" applies to blowing up an alcohol still. That was some good times.<br/><br/>Matthew (the Warlord's Daughter)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_213641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/213641/#Comment_213641" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-20T15:12:01+00:00" title="June 20, 2009  3:12PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            15 dice vs. difficulty 6 is pretty good!

Something to experiment with, probably.</blockquote>\nPerhaps something like <i>Bliss Stage</i>, in which the unallocated dice add Bliss (1 for 1-2, 0 for 3-4, 3 for 5-6) and the character story is over after you accumulate more than 108 Bliss.  So you can bring in a lot of dice and greatly improve<br/>your chances of success, at the cost of burning out faster.  That may not be much of a disincentive for one-shots, though.<br/><br/>Someone or other I talked to at GPNW had an interesting idea that barely exceeding should be somehow rewarded more than overkill, to represent doing things with an economy of effort.  I don't know if that could be applied somehow to LB/TB.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
