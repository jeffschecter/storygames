Complimentary guest badges will be available to volunteers, giving you access to the show for all four days. Volunteering involves facilitating games you love for enthusiastic strangers, for three four-hour slots over the course of the show. <br/><br/>If you\u2019re interested in joining us, or if you have questions, shoot me an email, or whisper me your email here. Then I'll send you the details I know and links to the sign up spreadsheets. <br/><br/>If you'll be at PAX as a panel speaker or to run a booth, please feel free to talk about your plans here as well. I'd love to talk about how we can coordinate the events better. <br/><br/>If you are anti-PAX for the various good reasons that people are anti-PAX, you can also whisper me here. I have some friends who are interested in promoting awareness and in building a list of people who wouldn't pay or volunteer without some changes.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
