For me it feels an important thing to celebrate as I thought that the group might not be quite the success it has been. This has been due to many newcomers and old lags coming to the meets with a sense of curiosity, enthusiasm and the desire to be involved in great RPGing.<br/><br/>We now have over 100 members and this continues to grow at an encouraging rate. It would be great to see new and familar faces on our birthday. We are having our usual sessions of gaming but with added cake as it seemed to go down very well last time we did such an event. We may even give out the odd panda dice (if Graham is around).<br/><br/>Hope to see you soon<br/>Piers (The Magus)<br/><br/>PS - yes, I appreciate this clashes with Furnace, apologies for this.<br/>PPS - if you're a very good boy or girl we might just run your favourite game (don't say F.A.T.A.L.)<br/><br/><a href="bit.ly/brdghc" rel="nofollow">London Indie RPG Meet</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
