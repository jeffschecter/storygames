There are those who say that they don't have this problem. For those of you who believe you've already found El Dorado, I can only say that the methods by which you play will not find it for me. I've never seen any approach to play that makes for a comfortable combination of these priorities. I won't argue that you're in denial, or that you're actually playing one way or another, but I'll just note that if you think you have successful play of this sort, it's very unlikely that you'll be able to help me. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot impossible, however. In fact I'm looking for a new way to get to El Dorado, the place where competition and stories are both generated, and if you know the as yet undiscovered northern approach, go ahead and let me know. We've already tried East, West, and South, and we're doubting that El Dorado exists at all now (hence the name). But I for one am going to try the North approach, and see what that gets me. If you know the way, or can see that I've strayed from the path, let me know. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm pretty firmly of the belief that decisions can't be made that prioritize more than one value at a time. The basic premise of Creative Agenda. If you don't buy that, you probably won't be of any help here... but, again, if you're the genius who has figured out a different perspective on this subject, fine, make your case. I may shunt you off to another thread, however, and I'll be quite skeptical. Just to warn. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, before we get into the details of possible solutions (or even getting started on the path to the north approach), why is this important to me? Well, as I say, since both forms of play are fun, I'd like a game that incorporates both forms. But moreover... have you ever had a player play a RPG and afterwards explain to you that it seemed problematic to them? They couldn't explain why, but they simply seem uncomfortable with RPG play? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can't blame folks for not being able to explain the phenomenon. Because it's only after years and years of theorizing about RPGs that I think that I've put my finger on it. Basically they see it as a game... after all, you've said it was one, an rpG. But when they played, the playing ground was more like life... there are no hard and fast rules for how things get done. You can have your character do anything, and at some point some judgment step comes in that's all-important. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is key to understand. In RPGs the question of even whether or not to roll has some aesthetic standard behind it. Usually the rules will give some very vague guideline like "Only roll if it's important." State of the art descriptions are actually similarly vague, if having a Zen feel to them; things like, "Say yes, or roll the dice." <br/>\n<br/>\nEven outside of resolution, there is a collaboration going on between players to figure out how the action is proceeding. "Freeform" play that has no mechanical resolution is all to do with each player trying to figure out if their contribution to the fiction is suitable at every move. Players don't just narrate "anything," there are standards, and ones that are often very hard to negotiate through, because they usually remain implied, and not explicit. Worse, you can't really be explicit about them because, in the end, there are infinite numbers of "moves" one can make, and each one could have a rule written about it to say whether or not it's Kosher. <br/>\n<br/>\nInstead we rely on player judgement to decide on how a particular maneuver goes. Do we simply allow it to become fact? Do we challenge it by forcing the player to go through a "Resolution System" in order to get the narration he wants to be accepted fact in the play space? If we do use a resolution system, how "difficult" is the task, or how "dramatic" is it? That is, the resolution system itself often has some variable in it that's adjusted by a player (often the GM) so that we can adjust how likely the outcomes are. Again, this requires that some participant in the game make a judgment as to something like liklihood, or dramatic importance, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142612/#Comment_142612" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T07:14:39+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  7:14AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 7:20AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The point being that in no other human endeavor called a "Game" does human judgment have so important an impact on the outcome as in a RPG. Usually in games we do all we can to ensure that the rules can be dealt with in as objective a fashion as possible. In RPGs this simply isn't usually possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, in fact, we can create "RPGs" where all options are mechanically laid out, and there is as little judgement involved as, say, in calling balls and strikes in baseball. But what's interesting is that when people play these games, the narration that occurs often feels "tacked on." Like one was playing Monopoly and narrating the purchases of the properties. Why would you bother?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact it would seem that it's a unique and valued property of RPGs that we adhere to some aesthetic standard as the means by which we determine success. Often this standard is, by the way, "realism." That is, we attempt to make the game world seem as though it were a "real" place, and the aesthetic that's reinforced, intends to reinforce this illusory feeling that the setting is a real place. In other games, the aesthetic is more dramatic. But in games where there is little aesthetic, many RPG players report that the RPG becomes "just a game" to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want to create a definition of RPG here, but to the extent that we want this unique part of RPGs in RPGs - and I do - any move to create a single set of hard definitions of all moves possible in play works against this property. What I (and many others) want from an RPG is that the narration matters in terms of outcome, and in specifics. That we don't group all of one sort of action into one sort of resolution, rendering the nature of the narration unimportant.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this human aesthetic judgement step seems intrinsic to the sort of RPGs we want. And, yet, it's also what makes us uncomfortable about RPGs at times. Well it does to many who play them for the first time, I've seen it first-hand. That includes people who have played D&amp;D as a minuiatures game in all practicality, and see RPGs that are far removed on the opposite spectrum. They find them suspicious. <br/>\n<br/>\nKnow what? I do, too. For all my talk about "wanting failure" for characters, there's a part of me that says that approaching the drama, without still allowing for the player to be competing in full, is asking the player to simply dissociate from the character to some extent. Which, of course, renders the drama inert to some extent. Care, but not enough to always win. It's simply not quite right. Yeah, we can play that way functionally, but it always feel like we're denying some part of ourselves. Does to me, anyhow. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf we had both going on, I think we'd have a game where people could feel comfortable that they were competing in their best interests, and yet also were coming up with satisfaction in creating story at the same time. Tautological, I know. I want both because I want both, beacause both would be good. But I honestly think that it would solve a lot of problems. <br/>\n<br/>\nI regularly hear the clamor of people in the "indie" crowd saying, "we need to create games that open up the market to the mainstrea." I'm dubious that this is really a mandate. But I'd also note that it's already been done. It's called World of Warcraft, and it's got ten-million players. One game that dwarfs any other RPG in terms of player-base. And, at ten million, it's rivalling any other mainstream activity. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, again, some people will say that WoW is not a RPG by their definition. But to me, it's precisely that WoW is identifiable as a "Game" activity, and that other RPGs are not, that makes it viable to the mainstream. Any RPG that doesn't market itself as a game, and doesnt' play as a game, will never reach mainstream attention. Any more than improv theatre will (note how comedy sports actually make a game of this, and how the mainstream suddenly pays more attention). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'd posit that, in fact, coming up with a functional way to combine the dramatic/aesthetic/simulative elements of an RPG with making it an actual "game" that people can deal with as a game (meaning having some objective playing field), is actually key to making an awesome RPG. It is the single most important nut that needs to be cracked. <br/>\n<br/>\n(If you disagree, then this discussion may not be for you.)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question is, can it be cracked?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142614/#Comment_142614" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T07:26:57+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  7:26AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll take a moment at this point to note that a couple of recent discussions that I've been having with folks (OK, harassing them), have been in an attempt to see if their games have solved the problem. For it seems to me that their games do attempt to do so. Unfortulately, they seem to fail by my standards. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere I attack Vincent's In a Wicked Age: http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26103<br/>\nHere I'm all over Ralph's game Blood Red Sands: http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=6316&amp;page=1#Item_49<br/>\n<br/>\nI like both of these designs, and this thread is, in part, an attempt to get out of attacking other games looking for the solution. I'll note that the fact that two of the designers that I most respect have approached this problem, and seem to me to be failing. This is how difficult this problem is. Laws, in designing Hero Quest, makes no bones about wanting to appeal to all players, and I find that game only works if you play to the dramatic side. Another failure at tackling the same problem. From my perspective. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you can see why I might be somewhat pessimistic about there being a solution. In fact any solution that says, "just do both, be competitive and be dramatic" at the same time simply misses the target. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what remains?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142615/#Comment_142615" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T07:40:57+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  7:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only two reasonable theories that I've ever heard for getting both sorts of play are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n - "Shifting" agendas during play. That is you play to address challenge one moment, and you play to address theme the next. A game that is meant to cause shift (rather than it happening haphazardly), is said to be "Transitional." Fang Langford's game Scattershot is an attempt at a transitional game where the transition occurs based on mechanical changes in the rules decided upon by the players. The game promotes one sort of decision one moment, and then we change the rules and it supports another sort of decision the next. <br/>\n<br/>\n - The other is far more problematic and theoretical, and I've dubbed it "Universal Play" where the system somehow manages to promote decisions that are always both tactically correct, and thematically appropriate at the same time. This seems impossible, however, when you consider that most players will, at some point, decide that the best way to create a theme is to have their character do somthing "stupid" (meaning tactically unsound.) I'm willing to hear arguments on why this is not so, however, and my approach below is to some extent informed by this idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother design that's interesting in this regard is The Riddle of Steel. The game has a massive combat sub-system, and a very influential "Spiritual Attribute" sub-system that interact with each other. Ron says that the thematic content overwhelms the tactical content, and by some readings he might be right in some ways. But interestingly that's never made me feel any less like I was competing when using the combat system in TROS. Sure, with enough dice from SAs, I can dominate the combat... but interestingly if I pay no attention to what's going on, I still might be beaten. Both drama and tactical play lead into character success to some extent. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurther TROS does some other interesting things in that the tactically sound decision tends to be the dramatic one. That is, if my character's SA is "Loves X" and X is in trouble, it may well make a ton of tactical sense for him to dive in right there, to get those extra dice. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, one could argue that TROS goes back to being gamey this way, in that the player doesn't have an option as to what the best solution is in a given circumstance. But the game does something else interesting in that it allows one to change their SAs in ways that tend to give the player back their ability to make dramatic decisions about what's important to their characters. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt does so, it seems to me however, by having dramatic decisions made one moment, and then tactical ones made the next. Overall Ron might be right as to what it tends to promote in play. And it's far from perfect. But it's always interested me as a model. Basically it's making the player think of these different priorities at different times in play. So it seems somewhat transitional, while also having the decisions be somewhat "universal" (both tactically sound and dramatically sound). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo it's always occured to me that you could "partition off" parts of play such that we could comfortably be making one sort of decision at one point in play, and be making another sort of decision at another. Note that Ron's contention is that there are "instances of play" that form the observable units in which we can discern a creative agenda. And generally it's supposed that these are fairly long. If not, then the data might get confused in going back and forth, and you might get incoherence. <br/>\n<br/>\nMy supposition is that we can create transition very rapidly by making different sub-systems, each that promote one thing or the other. Such that when you're using one system, you're obviously playing tactically, and when using the other, you're obviously playing thematically. This is actually almost trivial to accomplish. The real trick is doing so in a way that links the two systems together so that the effects of one flow into the effects of the other, without the one agenda also leaking into the other. Because linking them is how you get the actions to each seem more "universal." <br/>\n<br/>\nBut can this be done? Without leakage that will create a slippery slope that likely ends up in the whole thing being gamism?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142620/#Comment_142620" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T08:07:09+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  8:07AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The general notion I've got is to have scenes be segregated into either dramatic or tactical. Or to, again, have subsystems that are engagable by players, each of which is suitable for only one agenda. <br/>\n<br/>\nA basic problem at this point is that I generally want to allow player freedom in terms of which agenda they're engaging. But the problem is that I have a feeling that this will cause many players to just use one or the other. This is also why I generally think that the one system should flow into the other, linking them, so that one can't get away with only playing one system or the other. This is, however, where the "leakage" may occur as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet's say we have system A in which I get rewards for kicking ass tactically, but they're used in system B to produce drama. System B, on the other hand, produces rewards for drama which can be used to give greater chances of success in system A. The problem is that players may start to ignore the real drama, and simply mechanically orchestrate the dramatic scenes in order to churn them out so that they get the bonuses for system A again. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe way around this is, it seems to me, is to have the rewards in system B be awarded by players for dramatically appropriate stuff. Like Fan Mail from PTA, if you will. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'll stop at this point and let folks jump in. Does this seem to make sense where I'm going? Any obvious problems? Any better solutions? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142633/#Comment_142633" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T08:57:30+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  8:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea, but I'm having a hard time grasping what it would look like!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142635/#Comment_142635" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T09:09:43+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  9:09AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, I applaud your willingness to look at new perspectives on old discussions.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>I'm pretty firmly of the belief that decisions can't be made that prioritize more than one value at a time.

Indie games tend towards relatively simple mechanics (with many interesting emergent interactions) but it's usually very easy to figure who "won" any given exchange (especially when CR enters the picture).  Combine this with the very common indie structure of "build tension until the situation explodes," and it becomes easy to finger someone as the winner of the entire game -- whoever "won" that final exchange when everything was on the line.<br/><br/>Consider a game, however, where the mechanics were complex to the point where there are more than one "win" condition in any given exchange, and even more emergent win conditions.  Different win conditions may be more or less useful given situation and individual tactical agenda, and since those things change, so do the values of the win conditions.  In this arena, it is much harder to point at any decision and call it a tactical error.  Certainly there would be some total bonehead mistakes that yield nothing, but not only are these avoidable by players, but many can be designed away.  What you are left with is a situation where any given result of the mechanics yields <em>something</em>, and those results (and especially the combinations of those results) are significant and valuable for later developments in the game.  Instead of a linear progression along the game board to the win condition, what you have is an artist's palette of options to be used to create theme.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142642/#Comment_142642" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T09:32:48+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  9:32AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 9:37AM by Valamir.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">The problem is that players may start to ignore the real drama, and simply mechanically orchestrate the dramatic scenes in order to churn them out so that they get the bonuses for system A again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way around this is, it seems to me, is to have the rewards in system B be awarded by players for dramatically appropriate stuff.

You are correct. And, in fact, part of what I'm looking at is whether or not my solution has any legs. If it helps with the exercize imagine a challenge mechanic in the place of the Fan Mail. But the "difference" between what I'm proposing, and what you have in BRS is that in the theoretical game there are two types of activities, each of which is judged differently. <br>\n<br>\nFor instance (and I propose this as something that I've kinda rejected already, but it may serve to demonstrate the point), we could have combat be competition based, but have a second system that regards what's important to the PC as the drama end of the game. Somewhat like TROS, in fact. The point being that there would be no possible way to "win" the dramatic system. The rewards would be given for how cool people thought the contribution happened to be.<br>\n<br>\nSo I hack up an orc, and get a drama point. That allows me to have a scene in which I decide whether or not to slay the orc children. If I make that scene interesting, then I get a challenge point, which I can use to slay the next orc. <br>\n<br>\nJust as a terrible example. Hopefully it illustrates. Since there's no "winning move" I can make in that phase of play, nothing that makes me gain any ground against the other players, there's no reason for them not to reward that which makes the scene interesting...<br>\n<br>\nExcept that they might not do so if it means that this challenge point puts you ahead of them. That's the "leakage" problem. <br>\n<br>\nIn TROS, one can argue that the rewards are sorta unidirectional. They don't cycle back all the way, except in terms of character development. So that's why I don't think you have much of that problem in that game. <br>\n<br>\nOne thing that I've proposed is putting in yet another link to the cycle. <br>\n<br>\nSomebody whispered to me that I've got a unique definition for El Dorado. I think that, in fact, El Dorado has always been the coherent/incoherent game. But, to be sure, I want everything in my version and it's "impossible" if it is for the same reasons. So one thing I'd like is to have world-building and other simminess as a rewarded activity. So, because GNS proposes three agendas, and for no other good reason than that (meaning I should think more about it), what occurs to me is to have three steps:<br>\n<br>\n1. Good challenge play gives rewards that benefit theme play. <br>\n2. Good theme play gives rewards that benefit world-building play<br/>\n3. Good world-building play gives rewards that benefit challenge play. <br/>\n<br/>\nI like this cycle because you can be pretty objective about the world-building portion. Basically if the player does the work to enumerate something, he gets his point that he can use to benefit himself in challenge play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJosh, I'm afraid that you are absolutely correct. This has been my problem so far, that I keep coming up with simplistic models like the above to try to elucidate how it might be done, when I suspect that the effective version is going to be horribly, horribly complex. Don't get me wrong, I love that idea. I love complexity, especially when it's elegantly created (such that the game isn't a chore). And that's what I would shoot for, certainly. But I have to have a basic idea of how to get there before I make the complex version.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can imagine a design method where I throw in the everthing but the kitchen sink, and stir it around until it does what I want, but I'm skeptical that this would be an effective design methodology. Might be worth trying, however...<br/>\n<br/>\nPlain and simple, I'm not sure that I (and maybe anyone else) have the brain wattage to make the leap right to the complex form. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that I think could be done is to have something more complicated than a "Cycle" like the one I propose above. Maybe with five or ten different sorts of activities that one can do, linking to each other in various ways. But I'm hard-pressed to come up with what those might be, or how we'd reward them, much less how you'd make the whole mess function. So for the moment, I'm sticking with as simple a method as I can theorize, trying to find the problems, and then seeing if we can't seal them up. Once we have some ideas on where to go, then I think we might add the complexity to make the solutions work. <br/>\n<br/>\nVery speculative, yeah. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142652/#Comment_142652" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T10:18:18+00:00" title="May  6, 2008 10:18AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As another example to follow the one above, imagine playing D&amp;D combats, but using Universalis in any scene in which combat does not occur. Now figure out how EXP convert to Coins, and how Coins convert back to EXP. So in the scene where we have our two characters having a duel of wits, like in Universalis, both players would be rewarded for participating, and the game informs you that there's no competition going on there. Then it kicks you back into D&amp;D for the next fight where the death mechanics inform you that you'd better play as hard as you can, or you'll lose your character. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, terrible example that I'd never try to implement, but hopefully illustrates what I'm talking about. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically the overall theory is that if I play game X, and it produces good gamism, and I play game Y, and it produces good narrativism, then all I have to do is switch back and forth between these two games in actual play, and I should get what I want. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne potential solution is simply not to have the sub-systems feed into each other at all. But then, again, that begs the question of how to trigger the "transitions."

To me Adversity is a component of the fiction and I like it to be real and threatening and driven, not fake and willing to take a dive for "the story."  Competition is something that happens between players.  I am actually trying to demonstrate that I play this game better than you do.<br/><br/>I really, really, really dislike people who make decisions "for the story."  I think it's actually antithetical to Narrativism believe it or not.  I think that such decisions are actually a form of Simulationism where the pre-play aesthetic standard for the "sim" is what the story *should* look like.  Instead I much prefer it when people play with unrelenting emotional commitment to their character's passions and only "quit" when something in the fiction (sometimes coupled with the state of the mechanics) genuinely undercuts that commitment.<br/><br/>But playing that way is still about prioritizing the players emotions and feelings about his character his fiction.  Even if he's playing the mechanics HARD to express them, and not about actually beating *ME* the other player.<br/><br/>So if we're talking about my passion driving unrelenting Adversity that you're genuinely opposed to and you're genuinely fighting against then absolutely that's compatible with story creation.  Sorcerer, The Riddle of Steel, In A Wicked Age... are all BASED on this.  It HURTS those games to play weakly and without commitment.<br/><br/>On the flip side (because I believe Narrativism and Gamism are kissing cousins) I think you can play a fully committed Gamist game where you really are trying to out do me, and get story as a SIDE-EFFECT.  In fact, I wish Ron would turn his attention to his Black Fire proto-game because I think that game has a high chance of producing this kind of play.  You won't ever be making decisions based on your emotional commitment to character and fiction but through your commitment to capturing your goals before the other players do, you'll end up with a nice little narrative.  In fact, I'm tempted to say that in a Black Fire game the winner would have a story behind him and the losers won't.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><br/>Let me lay it out even plainer.  I believe you can do Step On Up with strong story support and your can do Story Now with strong strategic support.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142677/#Comment_142677" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T11:54:45+00:00" title="May  6, 2008 11:54AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marco, again, yes.

I hate the phrase "Step On Up" or I'd use that. Any clearer? That can involve player competition, or competition against the scenario, or any other sort of challenge that shows the player to be a creative tactician, with that display of his talent as the point. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that, the only other thing I'd say is that, Sorcerer doesn't get this for me, and that In a Wicked Age is actually giving me fits by the way it approaches it, and then does it all wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet me be clear, it seems to me (and I'll admit that I might still not get something about the game) that IAWA does precisely the same thing that happened in my 1979 D&amp;D campaign, where there was this constant uneasy friction between players trying to win, and me trying to get them to play "in-character." That is, it seems to try to accomplish it to me by saying, "Just play the right way." Same with Blood Red Sands. The mechanics one moment make me want to play gamism, the next narrativism, but so closely intertwined that the conflict is actually uncomfortable. Because it's basic incoherence. I don't know which thing we're prioritizing as a group at any particular moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nI want both things, but at the moment that the decision is made, I want the mechanics to support one and only one sort of decision. So that everybody is clear in agreeing on the agenda for that decision. And then I want the game to allow the next decision to be clearly in another agenda. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142681/#Comment_142681" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T12:11:23+00:00" title="May  6, 2008 12:11PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think El Dorado is pretty easy to get and was going to say that here--but wanting competition and a good story is something I know less about since I don't care about competition as much in my gaming.<br/><br/>But I'd look at <i>Capes</i> as "Exhibit A."<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142706/#Comment_142706" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T13:38:12+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  1:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 1:39PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marco, good thought.

I've found that players wind up having more emotional commitment to characters than the rules require, which is a nice side effect.  We've actually grown fond of a reoccuring "NPC" who's been played by two different players and has gone from villain to redeemed and fell again through the actions of 3 different "PCs".<br/>\n<br/>\nMike a couple of things.<br/>\n<br/>\nBlood Red Sands does have the pure competition part of play during the Conflicts where everything is mechanical effects and the narrative color around those mechanical effects.  And the "other" part of the game which is leading into and setting the stage for the upcoming Conflict.  That other part isn't entirely devoid of competitive elements as setting up for the conflict can be important to the winning strategy...but I'm not sure what would be enhanced by having this other part of the game devoid of competition.  Meaning I don't see how you avoided the Conflict of Interest issue you were discussing at all, you've just structured it differently.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'd appreciate that you refrain from saying things like "That is, it seems to try to accomplish it to me by saying, "Just play the right way." Same with Blood Red Sands."  Because that's not true.  There's mechanics there that go way beyond "just play the right way".  You may not have seen them all in your brief exposure, you may not think they address all your concerns, but the implication that BRS relies on "just play the right way" vs. having actual rules is wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142720">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142720/#Comment_142720" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T14:17:59+00:00" title="May  6, 2008  2:17PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 6, 2008 2:19PM by Josh Roby.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Plain and simple, I'm not sure that I (and maybe anyone else) have the brain wattage to make the leap right to the complex form.</blockquote>\nMike, I feel like you're asking me, "I've got this black permanent marker and this red permanent marker.

It's that "compete, but don't compete too hard" kind of thing.<br><br>I think this has to do with the nature of creative agenda.  <br><br>For me, I think, your "play tactically for thematic advantage, play thematically for tactical advantage" game would not feel right, and no amount of "policing" of input is going to make it better.  If you're trying to add thematic content to the game for a tactical advantage, then you're still making your decisions based on tactics.  If there's some "challenge" mechanic, or if there's fan mail, or whatever, that's simply another hurdle to jump to get your tactical goal.  You're thinking "how do I push the other players' buttons so they give me fan mail?" or "How do I get away with this without being challenged" rather than "what do I think about the issues this game is raising, and what do I want to say about that?" or "What would my character do here?"<br><br/>One of the many things that creative agenda is said to encompass is the choices players make at the table, and their reasons for them.  I think if you're making thematic choices for tactical purposes, then you're playing Gamist.  <br/><br/>Perhaps a way to think about this would be like a fighting fantasy novel.  Some of them have pretty interesting stories, and it's not impossible to imagine a fighting fantasy novel that adressed a premise and was a "capital S" Story, in the sense Ron uses the word.  But as long as one of the endings is marked "you win" and the others are marked "you lose", the player is still playing Gamist, and not addressing premise.  You can look at the fiction that was created (or discovered) through play, and think "wow, that was great", but it's not Narr play if the player made the decision they did because they were trying to get to the "you win" ending.  It's only if all endings are valued equally that the player's choices have thematic meaning - when the players decide which ending has value for them.  That's a thematic statement, and it's the basis of Narr play, as I understand it.<br/><br/>So I think that Fan mail can't work in a competitive game.  You're asking players to make decisions that are counter to their interests - to work in two mutually exclusive modes.  They're competing with each other, but they're also being asked to judge their opponent's contributions, and reward them.  It can only work (in my opinion) if those rewards go towards an entirely different goal, that's not tied to the competition at all.  (I'm a bit of a Fan Mail hater in general though, so take this with a pinch of salt).  <br/><br/>I think the best play experience I've had with a game that employs some elements of competition is The Mountain Witch.  You've got these characters with competing goals, and the players are motivated to get their characters what they want, but the players also have other goals - reveal their dark secrets, ensure the success of the group as a whole, and so on.  These goals all conflict with each other, but in a kind of productive way, where whatever you choose, you're making a thematic statement, and advancing the game.  The competition in the game isn't very strong.  There's no "winner", but there's definitely a frission of competition between the players that makes the game spark.  That's the closest I've come to "El Dorado".                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142789/#Comment_142789" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T04:32:27+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  4:32AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2008 4:33AM by C_Edwards.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mike,<br/>\n<br/>\nIt might help if you determine what "winning" means, to YOU, in this theoretical game and reverse engineer from there. So you've got this ruthless competition, utilizing an array of tactics, creating theme (and possibly world-building) in the process, in order to achieve... what? To WIN, right? Because there is no other proper goal for people who really like competition in their games. So tell me, what does winning look like? It may just be the process of playing a completely fulfilling game. But I'm not sure that's really going to scratch the itch you've got fully. I think this whole enterprise rests upon the details of the rewards and reward cycle. Are you looking for a game with some crunchy resource management or one that is fairly streamlined?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142798/#Comment_142798" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T05:32:18+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  5:32AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great comments by all. One by one...<br>\n<br>\nJesse, <br>\n<br>\nYes, that's one of the problems, where "leakage" can occur. Or maybe it's better to call it "overflow." I can theorize one easy way around it, though it's probably not optimal: every "tactical phase" you play out the entire contest. If that phase is "can I get through the dungeon," you don't stop for thematic stuff until we know if you've beaten the dungeon. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't like how that pacing sounds, however, so I wouldn't use it. But I think it might solve the problem. Which makes me jump forward to Simon's point...<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon,<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a reward makes me do something dramtically interesting, then it doesn't matter the nature of the reward. Does it? The reward system only has to get me to perform the behavior we're looking for. OK, I only half-heartedly believe that, but this is the response that Ron Edwards gives when one asks him, if you give bonus dice for cool actions in Sorcerer, doesn't that lead to gamism? Ron's response is that it doesn't in practice, because the mechanic is contained amongst other mechanics which, together, serve to inform the player that play is not about tactical choices, but about thematic ones. <br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the ways that Sorcerer, and a lot of other RPGs, do this is to simply give you few to no tactical options to make. In Sorcerer there are no resources to burn that are tactical, but instead they all have to do with thematic choices. So, yeah, the reward in question makes you win more often, but it doesn't lead to gamism.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, generally speaking both the reward itself, it's purpose, and what you get the reward for doing, are influential in determining the behavior that the reward gets. This is the problem with giving EXP in D&amp;D for "roleplaying." Sure, you might see some roleplaying occur to get them, but the only use for he EXP informs the player that they're to be powergaming. With Sorcerer bonus dice, they give an instant boost to character success, and so don't inform future play at all. Other than to encourage getting them again in the future, which requires doing "cool stuff" (narrativism criteria). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo I'm less concerned that the rewards themselves will be problematic... I in fact DO want players to go to challenge next, and then back to theme, and the rewards will do that. So in a way they are like EXP for roleplaying in D&amp;D... except that there's no other way to get the EXP. They say, "That was thematically cool, now go face a challenge." and then "You faced that challenge well, go create theme." <br/>\n<br/>\nThe real challenge, it seems to me, is to make the sub-systems themselves, the mechanics of them that occur before the rewards, such that they reinforce the mode that's supposed to happen in that phase. <br/>\n<br/>\nFurther, note that my notion of using "points" to link these together is just that, notional. Meant to spur discussion. As Josh says, the actual effective implementation may be much more intricate, and might not even have to do with reward-systems as we're used to them. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's interesting, in fact, is that rewards in RPGs are almost always given out in terms of increased character effectiveness, no matter what it is that you're trying to reward. There are exceptions (usually player empowerment currency), but they're relatively rare, even in "story-games." <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142802/#Comment_142802" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T06:19:08+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  6:19AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To Simon and Ralph,<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I believe that creating a game whereby story occurs as a side-effect of competitive play is very possible. In fact, I'd say that Primeval, and Pantheon are two good examples. Perhaps even Baron Munchausen. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut all these games actually come down to one of the two agendas in effect. Which is very much what I'm trying to overcome. I think some of these games are, in fact, attempts at overcoming the problem in question. But that they don't actually hit the mark. In fact Primeval creates an entirely new Creative Agenda that I'd call "Storytelling" which means that there's no "exploration" and that makes it a very strange RPG. It's simply a Storytelling Art Contest. <br/>\n<br/>\n(Which is a neat idea, but not what I'm after at all.)<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom one perspective, the problem that I have with BRS as I've experienced it (as opposed to how it may exist if played from the full text), is that it's not 100% gamist, that we're being asked at all to come up with subjective judgements that muddy the waters regarding player victory. Because, yeah, the positioning is, in fact, about tactical advantage. If its to be so, then I want hard and fast objective rules for that portion of play. And I lean this way, generally, because without that added on, the strategies for overall BRS play seem very limited. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut one could theorize also where there could be absolutely no tactical advantage to the positioning. Where, instead, the player was informed during that phase that there's nothing he could do that would advance his position, but all he could do is to make thematically creative entries. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf so, then BRS would look more like what I'm envisioning. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I wouldn't do that for BRS. I'd make the positioning mechanically locked down, and then what I'd do if I wanted to add on thematic play, is to cordon off some other part of play for the purpose of doing thematic play. Yeah, this is problematic for reasons already discussed (it might eliminate narration in favor of mechanics). But it's precisely because the positoning part of play is "mixed" that it makes me uncomfortable. The fact that I want positioning to be both at the same time, so as to both have narration, and be mechanically objective, is the paradox that we're addressing by trying to figure out parts of play that we could be satisfied in not being mixed. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's interesting that when the characters are in conflict, this seems to be where it's most appropriate to have the challenge mechanics. I guess all games are about conflict at some level? Combat, being "mortal conflict" which makes it the most important sort, and, hence why it usually gets special attention as an arena of character conflict? In reactive moments I've posited a game in which, say, the political arena is the one in which the player challenge arises, and then when personal physical conflict occurs, we go to thematic resolution (this would neatly address the problem of character death). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut lately I've been more of the opinion to empower players to decide what conflicts they want to make challenges, and which they want to make thematic, so as to give greater freedom. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChris,<br/>\n<br/>\nPart of the problem here is that I'm theorizing about how to create a technique to get past this particular problem, and not trying to make an actual game. So... I don't have a win condition in mind. It could range from "Get Powerful Fast" to "Become a Diety" to "Bond a Neighborhood into some sort of Unity." But very definitely it can be subtle. It doesn't have to be a "Player X who Does Y First is the Big Winner." That could be a fun condition, but not a neccessity. <br/>\n<br/>\nJosh, <br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be part of the problem for your idea as well. Since I'm dealing in the abstract, it's even harder to start nailing down specifics on anything more complicated. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMy biggest failing as a designer is that I have ideas for how to make things work mechanically, once I have a goal of play. But I'm rarely inspired by any particular goal of play to make a game about that thing. This is why I end up often with generic designs. I'm more interested in the method of play than what specifically the play should produce. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, OK, let's take a stab at it. Josh, I completely agree with you. Again, it's not a matter of should we do what you ask, but can we? And I also agree that we can... it's just going to be extremely difficult, I think. We may fumble about quite a lot.

I think that the fact that we've stayed with fantasy quite a lot in RPGs is not just by random chance of the first RPG being a fantasy RPG. But, in fact, that's mixing up cause and effect. I think that the fact that they played fantasy miniatures lead to RPGs. The two have a kinship that makes them very appropriate together. I always thought that it was interesting that in olden days, they used to be called FRPGs (Fantasy RPGs) even if they were about science fiction.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I digress.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also all about the world-building. That is, I am a fan of Tolkien and even like the post-Howard Conan stuff to the extent that it intends to create a continuum for the character. Yeah, I'm just that geeky. In any case, I think it'll fit the design well to have this as a focus. And, again, world-building seems to be something that is, in some ways intrinsic to the fun of RPG play. Why not incorporate it functionally into play, instead of having it be something done pre-play, which sometimes ends up unrelated to play? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm all about linking the world to the magic, for that is, to me, what makes magic feel magical in play. It's precisely D&amp;D's generic spell list usable in every D&amp;D world that makes it seem wrong to me. <br/>\n<br/>\nOK, so now I've got some design goals emerging that we can use as a basis for constructing out system which also has as a goal having transitional play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo let's start putting in all of the pieces that Josh has noted that we have lying about. Perhaps unexpectedly, I'll start with Amber. <br/>\n<br/>\nI hate Amber, because of the extent to which resolution is GM fiat. But I think that "karma" resolution (as opposed to "fortune" with randomization) tends actually to be superior for the creation of games that invove substantial player challenge. That is, hardcore gamers often note that if the randomization effects are great enough, that player skill cannot be demonstrated. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not against having any random-ness, but I'm going to avoid it where possible. An example of a karma-only game would be Fred Hicks' game Pace. On the other hand, some people point out that if you have enough random-ness, that, in fact, the law of averages tends to make it so that the randomness can be accounted for, and has less adverse affects in terms of being able to judge player effectiveness. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I feel is missing from many karma games is variability in success. That is, if we know if a character can succceed at something, it's not very interesting. This is the usual reason we incorporate randomness, a sense of suspense. But this can be accomplished with a karma system. One commonly used method is that of currency expenditure. You need a total of 7, but your skill only gives you 5, so you have to spend 2 in order to succeed. <br/>\n<br/>\nThese are interesting in that you definitely get a feel for whether or not a player cares to win a particular contest, but there's no player challenge involved here. In fact this is a good way to make a purely narrativism portion of a system. Assuming there's no tactical repercussions like, "You might need it to win later." So perhaps resolution for the thematic portion of the game can use something like this. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what for the tactical portion? Well another way to introduce a level of uncertainty is to have players bid resources in secret. You have a 5 skill, and I have a 4, but if I bid two more than you do, then I win. This is related to the Game Theory concept of a "dollar auction" (how much would you bid for a dollar?) and can be a lot of fun if the amount paid is the lower of the two bids. <br/>\n<br/>\nOther sorts of "hidden information" also cause uncertainty. Not knowing your opponent's level, for instance. We'll do some of this. What's key, however, is that there be enough information available such that the player be able to form opinions about likelihoods and such that involve player skill. Too much hidden and the game is, again, all random. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo that extent, an interesting part of play can be obtaining information about your opponent, and/or the strategies he's employing. It's a fun trade-off, to have to burn resources on learning, as opposed to simply spending them to overcome your opponent. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142818/#Comment_142818" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T07:38:27+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  7:38AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You'll note that if I'm going to create a game with gamism as part of play, that I'm going to bring to bear all of the knowledge I have from things like Game Theory and boardgame design. In fact, if we're going practical, I may well tap my boardgaming wonk friends to test out the gamism parts. <br/>\n<br/>\nWant to know a fascinating thing? In boardgame design, for games that are long, it's near universally considered that "player elimination" is bad game design. Designers are willing to go to extreme lengths to avoid it. So we'll make this a principle in this game. It's not about whether or not the player position survives to the end of the game (I'm not envisioning a set lenght game, either). But it's about how well the player does as play goes along. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the subject of endgame, I want a mechanical method to determine if and when the game is over. Conditions that players can cause to happen pretty easily, but which they never have to. The simplest example, and therefor one I won't use, is that of a player vote. This is more or less how it works in most games, just tacitly. I want to make the question to continue a vote of confidence in the game. Perhaps allowing the game to mutate to accomodate player loss and acquisition. Something that inter-relates with some of the other factors of the game so that it's an informed decision to some extent. <br/>\n<br/>\nMore in a bit...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142829/#Comment_142829" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T08:02:57+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  8:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gave this sort of thing some thought a little while back when I was developing a game were the players competed, but only had one character between them. The competition was to be the player in control when the scene was won (everyone loses if it was lost).<br/>I wanted the competition to have no effect on the chances of winning/losing the conflict, so I designed a card based system that worked on two levels, neither interfering with the other. I never quite got it right, but I'm still working on it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>1. Good challenge play gives rewards that benefit theme play.<br/>2.

So you are still losing out in the competition for giving fan mail, even if it's two steps removed from the competition.<br/><br/>As I see it...\n<ol>\n<li>The competitive part needs to have fixed rules (like a board game).</li>\n<li>The competitive part can feed into any other system.</li>\n<li>The other parts can have any rules you like as long as they encourage their own agenda.</li>\n<li>The other parts cannot feed into competition.</li>\n</ol>\nThat way you get a game where you are encouraged to compete but are still free to pursue the other goals. This, like has been mentioned before, requires some part of the game to be declared 'gamism territory', and be clearly labelled.<br/><br/>How that manifests itself in a game probably depends a lot on what the game is about. You could have both play types going on at the same time in some games but for others they need to be separate.<br/><br/>Mixing Nar/Sim is a different, trickier, problem I haven't thought about so I couldn't really comment apart from to say 'world design' doesn't have to be simulationist, if your agenda is to create a world specificaly to reinforce a narrativist theme.<br/><br/>John,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142846">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142846/#Comment_142846" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T08:56:27+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  8:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, almost like the Tragedy of the Commons.

Interesting that your version separates the conflicts. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what you're advocating is a one-way progression. That's certainly effective, except... how do we get back to "step on up" once we've gone down the road? Hmmm... Perhaps something that happens in the Theme or worldbuilding phase simply mechanically sets off a challenge? Players don't seek it out, but instead are forced into it mechanically? <br/>\n<br/>\nThat appeals to me in terms of making the player solely an advocate for the character. But part of me likes the idea of players setting up their own challenges, to some extent. I particularly like players being able to select their own level of risk... but perhaps that can be incorporated even if the player doesn't choose when to have a challenge occur...<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it's interesting that the "leakage" tends to be seen as "Gamism interfering with my narrativism." I think that this is the phenomenon you see. But might that be my own bias showing? Because if the other sort of leakage may occur... narrativism tainting competition, then we'd have to organize it in the opposite direction with narrativism on top, and we have the problem with gamism leak again. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan you have any "Cycle" and not have leakage? <br/>\n<br/>\nMy idea with world-building is that there would be no subjectivity. It's not fan-mail. As a really bad example, you could get one point per 100 words you write about the setting. If this is what benefits challenge, then what the person rewarding theme is doing, is, yes, giving an opportunity for the other player to get points, but doing so in a way that he only gets them if the player gets the worldbuilding out of play. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes it help at all if the players aren't forced to be in direct "competition?" If, in fact, they can co-operate? Is it still problematic if the players have the option to be in competition with each other? Do we have to force them to be on the same team for this to work? I think that's really still as problematic, in a way, because you have the case where players collude to gain points to win, and simply pass on their points to the other player perfunctorily, because to do otherwise hurts the team. <br/>\n<br/>\nHow do you make a player an unbiased judge if he has a stake in the outcome? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142853/#Comment_142853" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T09:09:44+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  9:09AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How do you make a player an unbiased judge if he has a stake in the outcome? </blockquote>\nThe "What goes around, comes around" Principle, perhaps?<br/><br/>I mean, you're still biased, but perhaps you think of the long-term a bit more?<br/><br/>Can precedence in judgements matter?

It is a special case and I can see the alternative being fun (kind of a 'push your luck' mechanic, which I generally like).<br/><br/>I hadn't thought about how a gamist challenge is set up. Any setting up of a challenge in the Nar section of play would make the strategy affect the story. Controling it with mechanics seems like the way forwards, since all the gamist play needs to be strictly defined. Maybe X challenges must be played per scene, so it doesn't matter what they are, or when they are, but they must exist.<br/><br/>If you want players to determine the nature of the challenge, Narrativist play could determine this... but that may affect the game if certain characters are better than others at certain types of challenge. Abstract statistics would help this but then you risk getting a disconnect between the fiction and the rules.<br/><br/>Players can determine the level of risk in the challenge with their gamist hat on, strategically, what do they think they could win.<br/><br/>Gamism does 'infect' the other agendas in a way, if player A competes and player B tries for a good story B will be dominated by player A mechanically unless you set it up otherwise... which would cheapen A's competition. If you want anything to feed into Gamism, it cannot be related to specifics of the story, otherwise it turns the story into another tactic for gamism, even if it's just creating a game world.<br/><br/>The world building idea still channels fan mail into gamism, even if there is a world building step in the middle.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Does it help at all if the players aren't forced to be in direct "competition?"

Pretty traditional in terms of creative authority. But sans the power to dictate plot as usual for a story-game. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe real question is whether or not this player will have any special judgement powers. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt solves a lot of my problems to thrust awards all on the GM, if he's not ever competing, as it fixes a lot of potential problems with conflicts of interest. But I also find that it makes the GMing job less interesting to me. I like the impetus in BRS to create community standards, and would prefer mechanics to do that. I simply want to have it occur in such a way that the player can clearly only have one agenda for any particular decision. <br/>\n<br/>\nPerhaps as the "World Player" the GM can judge the quality of additions made in the world-building phase? That's close to solving many problems.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Gamism, with objective win rewards that empower narrativism play.<br/>\n2. Narrativism play with player subjective rewards that allow the player to do world-building. <br/>\n3. World-building play where GM subjectivity as to quality lead to Gamism rewards. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis way the GM is only judging on things that are not tactical in nature, and maybe so won't feel that he's hurting any player unduly... simply enforcing the quality of certain content outside of tactical play. The only issue is that, as I've written it, the reward for narrativism gives the player an opportunity to gain in gamism by doing the world-building work. Yes, he may be satisfied with the quality of that work, because the GM has done his job in making sure that it is quality. But we could still maybe withold rewards for good narrativism, simply on principle, if the player is in direct competition. <br/>\n<br/>\nA potential solution: We can have the narrativism judgement made by a player who is "impartial" in that he can have no current stakes set up with the other player. If, in fact, there's no way to gain permanent position on all players, then there's going to be cases where neutral third parties do exist. But then why not simply force the GM to do the job? If it's comfortable for the player, then why not for the GM? This makes sense... have objective rules to cover all of gamism play, but have the GM subjectively be the judge of the other sorts of play. Hmmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know if I'm just a lazy GM trying to pass off this duty to other players, or if there's a value in other players getting to make judgments about this stuff? In that it keeps them glued to what's going on?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142870">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142870/#Comment_142870" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T09:47:44+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  9:47AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, at this point the whole "thematic" stage is pretty fuzzy. That is, if I do well in gamism, what is the reward that feeds into the narrativism? The simple answer, and I think it's probably bad, is that the reward is an opportunity to do a thematic scene. The reward probably should not be a bonus for the player to get his way in some thematic scene, right? As thematic scenes would not be about resolution, but about choices? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's so easy to get caught up in creating bad circles here... I keep getting the idea that the gamism reward leads to the player getting to put levels into some sort of "Values" for his character (scenes being set up as selections between values). The theme created being what the character finds more valuable. The problem is... what do you do with these levels? The obvious thing is to have them act like SAs in TROS, at which point they are directly feeding back into the gamism empowerment. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what reward do we give to the player? I'd rather not limit how much theme a player wants to put in. I'm skeptical that an effectiveness reward would make sense in thematic play, and any reward that ends up giving the player more effectiveness seems directly leaky. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf, in fact, the value adjustment was an opportunity, but the levels were a zero-sum game, would that do it? This is something I've thought of before. For my one point, I am allowed to adjust up one value, by lowering another. And these values are, in fact, used in tactical play, but only to indicate where the color is coming from. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat sounds good, but if there are actual levels involved, then there are likely degenerate strategies that involve stacking up one as high as possible, and then trying to maneuver to use it (and the attendant problem of there needing to be a judgement as to whether or not it's useful in a given situation). <br/>\n<br/>\nHow about a character has five values, and thematic play is about adjusting these? Renaming them, for the most part. Then the player simply invokes two in any contest. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem then is that it seems... pointless sorta. You could call your values X and Y, and since they always apply at your whim, you'll always get your +2 or whatever. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut let's plug it into our overall system with the world-building in it. How about players are able to work on creating stuff related to their character's selected values? So the effectiveness of the selection never goes directly to gamism, but instead to empowering where the player has world-building control. And, again, if they do well there, then they get the gamism reward. <br/>\n<br/>\nCan the thematic play actually be judged objectively? Like I chose X and Y values to chose between, and get my reward for making that choice? If so, however, that's the slippery slope to narration being meaningless again, no? GM subjective award here is better? <br/>\n<br/>\nI think that I'm beginning to stretch too far to get the effects I'm looking for. I'm not sure that, for instance, limiting realms of control by selected values is all that interesting...<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry that this is becoming very stream of consciousness...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John%20K" title="John K"><img alt="John K" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John%20K">John K</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142877/#Comment_142877" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T10:21:30+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 10:21AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;">I'm sorta not kidding here, and I'm not talking about gambling exactly.

The solution may be to make each subjective choice have a very small effect on the game, so no one choice can be abused to let someone win... then again, stories tend to build up to a climax which high stakes at the end, and that would stop that from being the case.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Mike">@Mike</a>,<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">This way the GM is only judging on things that are not tactical in nature,</span><br/>But he is judging tactical matters, saying 'yes you get bonuses' to setting info gives a direct benefit to your tactical play as I understand it.<br/><br/>About GMs: I'm not sure how much a GM would affect the problem, since they need to have a stake in <i>something</i> otherwise there is nothing for them to care about.<br/><br/>About rewards: Keep the two stats for both games seperate? Gamist stats could advance through winning conflicts but thematic stats just get swapped around through narritist play? You could also keep world building stats and rewards within world building.<br/><br/>I get the impression this would be an easier thing to explore if a game was written to explore it, we'd then have something concrete to talk about.<br/><br/>John,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142882/#Comment_142882" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T10:30:36+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 10:30AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of things:<br/><br/>In order to articulate where I'm coming from, I need to say what I think of Sim (and by extension Nar).<br/>1. I think that ultimately there is nothing "good" in Sim that is <i>incompatible</i> with Nar play. This puts me at odds with how a lot of people view the model but it's key to my understanding of how this kind of play works. I think that a <i>lot</i> of what people call Nar play is at odds with <i>The Right to Dream</i> because of the way people approach the games--and that's what I'll talk about.<br/><br/>2. In order to have an exploration heavy Nar game you need to do the majority of the work "up front." That is: before play starts. The key concept revolves around making a "fit character" to explore the premise and then playing from an immersed, actor-stance position using task resolution. <br/><br/>3. In order to make a "fit character" you have to know several things:<br/>(a) what the premise will be--in order to know this, you have to know what the action in the game will revolve around more than a standard game might reveal--not "everything"--but enough to know what the likely conflicts will be and how you, as a player, might want to react to them.<br/>(b) You need to fit in with everyone else: everyone should talk about their characters before play starts and possibly have a lot of interaction between them--including front-loaded conflicts.<br/><br/>4. The GM has to do a good job of making the game stable in the face of immersive play. The situation <span style="text-decoration: underline;">must explicitly</span> involve premise, the characters directed at it, and the ability for them to act meaningfully on it. The play of the game must then be <i>structured</i> to support this.<br/><br/>This is a best-practices approach: we know that the players will simply be playing their characters in an immersed state so the game needs to survive a lack of actor-stance. This means:<br/><br/>(a) attention to pacing--the GM will pay special attention to pacing because bad pacing will not only kill literary merrit but will bore players and pry them out of actor-stance / immersion. In order for the group to be "living the dream" they will need to be properly paced. The <i>situation</i> should be designed with elements that will help pace things such as NPCs who are close to and trusted by the PCs that can generate "pacing events."<br/><br/>(b) The game is hard to stall / disengage from. The situation should be one that will grip the PCs and the Players. The GM cannot count on the PCs engaging "because that's where the game is." The situation should be impossible to simply ignore.<br/><br/>(c) The action should allow for character exposition. There can be lower intensity scenes that simply put the characters in a position and let them be who they are--these can't be too long or you are moving away from both tight literary structure and, likely, address of premise--but not <i>all</i> character development <i>must</i> be in the face of hard, premise-related, adversity. A few of these scenes, especially in the early parts of play, will help the players establish character in an immersive fashion.<br/><br/>(d) The game should not be brittle. There are a number of flaws that can kill a game like this--such as having the villain appear in early scenes to taunt the PCs. In these cases, acting in actor stance, the PCs try to <i>kill</i> the antagonist (in this typical hypothetical) and the GM must deal with both structural frustrations (you don't kill the villain in Act 1) and mechanics issues (how do you engineer an escape?). It is, for example, best-practices to send a flunky of the villain to taunt the PCs and let them kill him if they can. Some thinking like this will help a lot.<br/><br/>(e) Run the game from a what-would-happen perspective: the GM will be controlling pacing and such but most decisions will need to stem from a what-would-happen place rather than "what is cool" or "what makes the <i>best</i> story." The PCs need aid in immersing and, it is my thinking, this helps. This allows for some anti-climax but if the situation is well developed and the players understand what is going on, it should be a low-rate-of-failure.<br/><br/>I submit that this model of play reliably produces what was called Vanilla Narrativist play that contains everything positive from The Right To Dream (Sim).<br/><br/>-Marco                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142910/#Comment_142910" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T11:57:03+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 11:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In looking at your ideas, Marco, I'm thinking that a lot of what I would do matches what you're saying, in that I think that more traditional models tend to have less problems dealing with transition. Or, put another way, the things that we've seen people put in games that make them distinctly narrativism oriented obviously function against what we're looking for. For a very simple case, having players have control over more than one character might be problematic for several reasons. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I'm positing a pretty traditional split in powers, so I think that I won't conflict much with what you're saying. On the "sim" side, I do actually perhaps "damage" the sim feeling by giving players power over the world in some ways. I think this is OK, however, for two reasons. For one, again, we are, in fact, trying to get segregated play. If the player is jarred out of immersion for that moment, it's not a problem by my goals. Second, I think that we can ameliorate jarring by simply pointing out how control of the character means automatic control of the world that's around the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, if my game isn't "sim" because the GM doesn't come up with most of the details up front, I can live with that. That's not the sort of sim agenda I'm after. <br/>\n<br/>\nI do, do, do, want for the setting to matter a great deal. Not just thematically, but in a "what if this happens?" sort of explorative way. This is probably narrativism, true, but then you aren't against that feature per se. Only where it interferes with a sense of immersion. I've found that, as long as I'm not the only one making stuff up about the world... as long as it has some existence outside of my ability to create it... that it satisfies any sense of immersion that I might have. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for "appropriate characters" I would definitely like that the character creation system address this. "Just talk about it" while a good notion isn't nearly as cool as when the chargen system automatically takes care of this for you. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd on the subject of premise... how narrow does it have to be? If we're talking about a potentially broad premise like, "How do we know our beliefs are correct, and how do we go about dealing with the world when beliefs come into contrast?" then I'm with you. Allowing for local premises to form during play is, to me, superior to nailing it all down before hand. If at all possible. General premise that the chargen system supports? Yes. Nailing down specific premise before play? No. <br/>\n<br/>\nSame with "stakes." One thing I agree with Vincent about with regards to IAWA, is that setting stakes before a contest is bunk. I'd solve the problem differently than Vincent has, but I think he's right. I much prefer the suspense of not knowing what may come of a contest outcome. Now, that said, I understand why stake-setting is attractive. For folks who have had their intents ignored for much of their playing career, or, worse, have had to suffer a GM who is out to "deprotagonize" their charater on failure, agreeing to what's at stake before hand solves this problem neatly. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo what I want for this game is a way to convey intent clearly, such that the agreed to contest has limits on what the outcomes can be. But those limits are not just this or that, they can be anything that doesn't fall outside of those limits. By doing so, you get the best of both worlds; suspense, and satisfactory outcomes. <br/>\n<br/>\nTypical methods for this of late have involved things like giving narration rights to the loser, so that they can ameliorate the effects of a loss... basically they're not likely to deprotagonize their own character. But I think there's a lot more milage out of giving it to a third party (GM, probably, or even the other player), and coming up with good descriptive limits to adhere to. These can flow from complex mechanical description outcomes. As I think Josh says above, if/when you have black/white Conflict Resolution, that is little to work from in terms of coming up with the in-game description of the event. Meaning that the participant actually has more breadth in what he can narrate. Given more mechanical feedback, the narration possibilities that fit become narrower. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142911/#Comment_142911" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T11:57:23+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 11:57AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2008 12:00PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo that extent, I need the resolution system to be "scalable" in terms of how much it resolves. Does it resolve the entire issue? Let's not do that often, instead let's resolve it in interesting parts, so that the overall outcome becomes richer in terms of the possible end-states. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is typified by the problem of many CR systems where you'll have a "Combat" and only one side can come out wounded or dead. This is one problem that a complex system of this nature should solve, that getting something should entail some concessions, and concessions that are not all ceded right at the end, but along the way. Such that the stakes really change during the contest in terms of likelihood of success, or escallation, and characters may, for instance drop out of the contest. Or otherwise change their goals. "I'm losing, I just want to get out of here now!"<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat John K is saying is how I feel... if I'm making part of the game, well, gamey, I'm going to try to make it as rigorous as possible. So that there's rarely, if ever, any case where a question like, "Is this move gamey" is likely to come up. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's not because I don't trust the other players, but because for whatever reason it's more comfortable when there's no question as to the validity of the move. This is not my trying to kill "abuse" or trying to fix "Assholes"... I was amongst the first to chime in that I know that game mechanics can't fix these social problems. It's possible for two entirely reasonable people to disagree as to the nature of something, and I'd like to minimize those occurances where possible? Why not do so? <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, again, I'm pretty sure that it's OK for the reward to be gamism promoting, as long as it's given for the narrativism (or in the example, world-building) activity. Again, even if the reward given is tactical, but I can only get it by doing something a-tactical, then how is it promoting making that decision in a tactical manner? <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, that means that world-building would not be a viable way to create position, either. Sure, I can narrate that, unbeknownst to you, that we're on top of an ancient burial ground full of spirits who are on my side. But that has no game effect until I pay for that maneuver to be effective in gamism play. Until then, it's "just color." <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's somewhat problematic in de-linking narration and effect, but if we say that the items created are the only ones from which such advantages can be made, then we make the narration significant again. Perhaps. And/or perhaps there's something that occurs with the world-building in the theme creation phase that makes those creations important. Linking values to built world-items? Relationships? Can we have such, and have them be important in such a way as it doesn't equal tactical advantage? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. John, I can't write it until I have some vision of what to write. That's what we're doing here, is getting to that step. This was Josh's point, too, that we really need to progress forward in a practical example. I'll get something down once I have some of these issues set aside. Likely that's when the real discussions will happen, sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142957/#Comment_142957" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T14:24:38+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  2:24PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may or may not be helpful, but it's something:<br/>\n<br/>\nCompetition does not equal Gamism.<br/>\nThe important bit is where competition is relative to Exploration (as per the Big Model).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Gamist play, Exploration's job is to provide the arena for competition.  If you do that, you're playing Gamist.  But you can invert that:  competition's job can be to drive Exploration forward.  I've got a game called <i><a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.angelfire.com/indie/btw/SUPER_ACTION_NOW_3.htm" rel="nofollow">Super Action Now!</a></i> that works that way.  And when you do it this way, it's not Gamist, it's Sim because Exploration is the end-all, be-all.  (Or, you can take that Exploration, with competition as the engine, and use it as an arena for addressing Premise, and you've got Narrativist play; from what I can tell, this is the way that IAWA works--although I haven't read or played it yet, so I might be mistaken)<br/>\n<br/>\nSAN! also showcases an interesting thing about reward systems.  In SAN!, you get points everytime you cause another player to laugh.  That seems simple, right?  You make someone laugh and you get rewarded?  But that's not the case at all; the points aren't a reward, they barely even mean anything (because it's very rare to run out).  So what's rewarding about playing SAN!?  It's this:  *I* get my reward when *YOU* make me laugh.  Laughing is the reward.<br/>\n-Marshall                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_142958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142958/#Comment_142958" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T14:32:53+00:00" title="May  7, 2008  2:32PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mike,<br>Everything you say is more or less on target, I think.

I think that's <i>fine</i> (in fact, the attempt to codify premise in some indie games is an unnecessary limit to these kinds of games).

If you want to limit the GM do it for other reasons--if you are trying to fix a people problem, don't do it in the rules (I realize this is probably controversial here--"But can't rules <i>help</i>?" I can hear some people asking. I think the <i>discussion</i> is a category-error.

As a vague and bad example, using tactical resolution to get through a dungeon then switching to thematic when you get to the lich-king that's about to give you a dirt nap.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, it seems to me that it would be a more elegant solution to have a nested set of rules and mechanics as opposed to separate systems with some specific points of feedback. Meaning something like, you have your thematic values mechanic as your outside box, the layer that is always "on". Inside of that you have nested your tactical specific mechanics that, when turned on, filter out through the thematic layer mechanics, focusing them towards a tactical use/outcome for the duration of the tactics oriented instance of resolution. World-building can be nested in there wherever is most workable and satisfactory.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143006/#Comment_143006" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T03:34:15+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  3:34AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my summation of the problem, as I see it:<br><br>Most roleplaying games use some amount of Drama resolution.  I think where you're talking at the start of this thread about "that thing with human judgement that's unique to roleplaying games", you're talking about Drama resolution.  It's the resolution that happens even before you roll the dice, when the GM decides "yes, this wall is climbable" or "no, there's no window back there" or "the pit is 200 feet deep, sorry".  That capacity for infinite complexity and detail, that sense of exploration is one of the very fun things about roleplaying.<br><br>But it's fundamentally incompatible with Gamism.  You can't assure that a GM is impartially playing the role of "the World", and unless you find "guess the GM" to be a fun game, that's not much fun.  I think a lot of Gamist D&amp;D play functions because of incoherence between a Sim GM and Gamist players (which seems weird).  You can't get other players to judge Drama resolution in a Gamist game, because that is the same as asking "how much do you want to win?"<br><br>But that leaves heaps of other room for design.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143024/#Comment_143024" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T06:32:01+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  6:32AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall,<br>\n<br/>\nI'm not sure what I'm supposed to do with your points.

I'm fine with having zero overt rewards if the mechanics of the game cause the sorts of play that we're looking for. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance, when I'm talking about points being spent to do a scene, that could actually be a much more mechanical transition. Like, "If you win a challenge, immediately do a thematic scene." Not that this example is a good rule, but, again, illustrates the principle. I'm using overt reward terminology because it's hopefully easy to visualize, and because it might be that we'll have to resort to them in some cases. Because no matter how much you say, "they barely mean anything" they're informative, and that's important. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMarco, <br/>\n<br/>\nExactly, situation rich with "premise-potential." <br/>\n<br/>\nWe agree that one shouldn't try to fix power-politics between players in play. Hence why I don't want to have overt stakes. That's not the same thing as saying that we don't want to empower players to have input into making entertaining resolution. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nChris,<br/>\n<br/>\nI may be reading you wrong, but it sounds like you're saying that we can go through an entire series of challenges, and get to the "winning move" challenge that'll determine if we're ultimately successful, and that somehow at this point we might trigger thematic resolution? <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the one hand, that seems to me to be damn appropriate. I often give the example of a player in a game who, when faced with what seemed to be an insurmountable baddie, sacrificed his life in order to thwart him. I fudged to ensure success in that case. Basically I wanted that thematic statement to trump the mechanical system I had that might have told us that the attempt was unsuccessful. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, it seems in some ways to violate the gamism to say, "Well, we've come all this way, worked very hard, but instead of playing it out to see if we win, we're just going to choose to win." <br/>\n<br/>\nThis goes to the question of how the transitions will occur. My first instinct is to give players the power to decide when they get to move to Thematic play from Challenge play. This way they'll make that move in the example if they figure that it's worth it. Here's a hard question, however. If the player is thinking in gamism terms, then isn't going to thematic resolution in the example simply the winning move? <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, that assumes a lot about what might happen in a thematic scene. Again, my initial notion for thematic play is that the character has some values that he has to choose between. Basically the player in the situation in question can choose to have his character "win" by giving up his character. In a lesser situation, they might choose the value of getting rid of the baddie, by selecting to devalue their family somehow. Like if the question is, "Do I get to go to fight honorably in the war, or do I have to remain home with my family?" there might be a dilemma between the value of honor and family. The player can choose to resolve this in gamism style, and potentially keep both... or lose both. Or some other combination. If he goes to thematic resolution, he chooses between the two, and one goes up, and the other down, in zero-sum fashion. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, that's very notional, but hopefully illustrative. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis would seem to follow what you're suggesting, Chris? <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143025/#Comment_143025" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T06:32:18+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  6:32AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\nYour "nesting" idea seems interesting, and, again, the "Cycle" is just what I'm using to illustrate. So I'm with you if I can figure out how to do the nesting. But I'm not envisioning what that would look like. Worse, I have an uneasy feeling that it would make the leakage problem greater, as the "outside" box might dominate play. From one POV, TROS could be seen like this, the gamism combat being nested inside the overall narrativism set of rules? <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the thing... I'd like for the gamism to be more than just local to specific events. That is, I'd like for there to be long-term gamism, too. I'm not sure if I want the typical thing where characters get more powerful over time to represent this, but on the other hand I do like that sort of building. Imagine for a political game building a power-base. That's a realistic way for a character to gain in power. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor a game about magic, I'm seeing characters gaining personal magical power through assembling either followers or acroutrements, and by devotion to elements of the supernatural (be they gods, spirits, elements, whatever). And then having the things that provide power also limit the use of the magic. Yeah, I'm stealing from Stafford here. Like a bandit. Because there's no better way to do this. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSimon,<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, in the context of Tynstian DFK, what I'm talking about is usually Drama resolution. But it's also those moments where the GM adjudicates some bonus or penalty in an otherwise fortune system. "It's going to be hard for you to hit him, what with him sitting on your chest, so you get a -2 situational penalty." <br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I agree that this is problematic for the gamism end. I probably won't be including any GM judgment in terms of that portion of play (and definitely not any player judgment). The explorative elements are still there becasuse we can deal with them during thematic play, and it's here that GM judgement (or other players') might be important. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis begs an all-important question, however. If there are gamism elements in the overall game, can any mechanical monkeying around in another part of the system, have any meaning? This is why I feel the need to have it cycle back to the gamism, and not be a one-way dead end. But, then, if in fact we need to have any actions have a gamism meaning, aren't we saying that the overall agenda is gamism? And won't that mean that all of the decisions will be gamism based? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe theory is that if you make the link indirect, such that you can't get advantage for the act that causes you to be rewarded for gamism, that the act itself will be about theme creation. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm getting close enough now to visualizing a game that I'm going to start writing something. The first drafts will really be more for poking at for problems, but I think they might have to be played to determine whether or not the "leakage" problem exists with the design in question. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143028/#Comment_143028" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T07:16:47+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  7:16AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 7:18AM by C_Edwards.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mike,<br/>\n<br/>\nYou'd definitely have to make sure the weight of the outside box doesn't overwhelm the inside boxes, particularly the tactical layer. Here's a quick and dirty example of how I'm seeing the nesting:<br/>\n<br/>\nSWITCHES\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n&gt; FACTUAL LAYER\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n&gt; THEMATIC LAYER\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n&gt; TACTICAL LAYER<br/>\nFact<br/>\nTheme<br/>\nTactics<br/>\n<br/>\nI see players choosing which switch to flip any time resolution is engaged, possibly with limits imposed on the frequency of use of any particular switch. Flipping a switch activates the corresponding layer and any layers before it. So if I flip my theme switch for a contest then I will also utilize the factual layer as well. The active layer farthest along in the chain should take precedence and have more mechanical weight in terms of deciding and effecting the outcome of the resolution. In use each layer has a certain focus:<br/>\n<br/>\nFact: (world-building) facts enrich and flesh out the game world and can be used to effect the PC's current situation<br/>\n<br/>\nTheme: using thematic elements helps create dramatic tension/payoff, your "story" driver<br/>\n<br/>\nTactics: tactical play has competition, resource management, and involuntary character death<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I've got my tactics switch on, the thematic and fact layers aren't going to have exactly the same function as they would if they were currently the dominant layer. With tactics active they take a support role and become filters for the output of the tactical layer.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes any of that make sense? To explain it more fully I have to actually start using it to make something playable.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and as for one type of resolution trumping another in play (like the theme/tactics example from my previous post), I don't think using theme or facts should be an automatic win. There should still be some uncertainty involved as to whether a player can achieve their desired result. Maybe they get an equally fulfilling but different result. Maybe the GM gets to reverse an intended outcome or whatever. Just as long as flipping the theme switch in front of the lich-king still requires something akin to a gamble.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143029/#Comment_143029" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T07:27:01+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  7:27AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Forgot to mention rewards.

Which makes it look like, "if you're funny, you get power," but that's not really the case; in practice, it's like this:  "if you're not funny, you run out of power."  The TILT! economy is a <i>punishment</i> system.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd some random thoughts on Gamism and Narrativism in the same house:<br/>\nCompetition makes Gamism when it's the priority; thematic choices make Narrativism when they're the priority.  SOMEtimes, the two are compatible.  Sometimes thematic choices are <i>also</i> good tactical choices.  I've got another game that tries to take everything away from the PCs, to see what they're willing to sacrifice to save it.  Sometimes, if they're clever, the players find a way to save it without making sacrifices (or at least without a serious sacrifice).  Which is cool, because their character accomplishes it by doing something, well, COOL.  Something exciting, something we'd like to see in a movie.  But that's always happened by accident; the general byword of the game is, "you're damned if you do, and damned if you don't; now decide which damnation is worse."  My game's basically about choosing how you lose.  Sometimes you win <i>now</i>, if you're clever, but you eventually lose.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, if it can be done by accident, there's gotta be some way to do it on purpose, right?  And do it consistently?<br/>\nMy only problem with that is I wonder if it would continue to be engaging on a pure story-based level.  Of course, you'd have to make loss conditions thematically significant, as well as victory--but then what happens if someone comes to the game caring more about theme than victory, and they choose loss because they find it cooler this time?  Or would that even be a problem?<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry if this is even less helpful than the last post<br/>\n-Marshall                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143282/#Comment_143282" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T08:37:52+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  8:37AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When a choice appears to be either one of two modes of play, we say that it's "conguent" with both. But what's important is that, in fact, the choice was made based on one or the other priority primarily. It might be that it was tactically the best move, and it also happens to make an interesting thematic statement, so I chose it for the first reason and the latter is a nifty side-effect. It might be that it was made because it was thematically kickass, and just happens to also be a good move. We don't know. <br>\n<br>\nThe big model says that Creative Agenda is not composed of individual decisions, in any case. But the overall agenda of play over an "instance" which is probably something more like a session. In point of fact, I can defect from the agenda, detectably, or undetectably, in making individual decisions, and still really not be working against the agenda. What's important to the agenda, and it being clear is what you find in terms of a "reward cycle." This may involve reward mechanics, but perhaps even more important is the social reinforcement a player gets for their acts. A player may get loads of EXP, but if other players are playing narrativism, they may call that player a powergamer, and punish him socially for his acts. <br>\n<br>\nIn fact game reward systems only inform and reinforce behavior, they can't make you enjoy it. They can, however, by making the agenda coherent, make it *enjoyable.* Rather, incoherence tends for many people to cause a lack of enjoyment. <br>\n<br>\nMe, for one. <br>\n<br>\nSorry for the refresher, but if we're going to use the terms, we need to be on the same sheet of music. <br>\n<br>\nThe point is that, at some point in play, there will tend to be friction between varying agendas. Sure, the game can try to keep the decisions such that play is always "congruent" and so you don't see the differences, thus preventing the appearance of incoherence. But this has only been done in theory to my knowledge, and even the theoretical models do it by limiting thematic choices to an extent that seems to actually be detrimental. <br>\n<br>\nThat is, you basically have to eliminate the option to try to make a poor tactical decision in order to make a thematic statement. You can't have the character do something tactically "stupid" to prove how valuable something is to them. Which seems to be a powerful tool. <br>\n<br>\nThat said, this is sorta precisely what I've been proposing, isn't it? All thematic decisions being zero sum. <br>\n<br>\nOften the "solution" to this in other games I've seen is for bad tactical decisions to be rewarded with some player reward. These come in various types:<br>\n<br>\nUse it Now Reward: Sorcerer Bonus Dice, for instance. "That's cool that you leapt into the firey pit, you get extra dice!" The problem with this method is that it means that we're not longer at all judging the tactical acumen of the player, but have gone totally over to narrativism. We're rewarding the cool, not penalizing the tactically unsound. <br>\n<br>\nDefered Reward: The character is at a lower chance of success for this action, but the player has a resource to call on in a later contest. Very "karma," this method. If you give now, you get later. In a Wicked Age has a great example of this in that if you choose in a contest now to use lower dice than your optimal ones (such that they're lower than your opponents'), then you get on the "Owe List" and are able to scratch your name off it later to get a bonus die. This is the ultimate example of bleed, however. That is, did I make the decision in order to be thematically interesting now? Or did I make because I know that having the potential of losing now is not as important as having the greater chance of winning later? This might be a case of "Accidental Story" where we get cool stuff as an outcome, but only because the system causes this, and not really because of player creativity, which is instead really about player challenge. Given the mechanics of IAWA, I played it Gamism style, and only tried to get on the owe list because I saw the mechanical advantage in the long run (interestingly my opponent's thwarted me in this, and I had trouble getting on the list). <br>\n<br>\nContinued...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143283/#Comment_143283" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T08:39:09+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  8:39AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br>\n<br>\nThis is why I want to reward players for winning in gamism with something that gives them power in the thematic realm. Because the reverse seems to automatically have the bleed problem. Which, again, begs the question as to whether or not any full cycle can avoid the bleed problem. I think it can be avoided for a very subtle reason. I'm not intending to reward tactically unsound acts. Ever. I'm intending to reward thematically interesting events, independent of their tactical quality. Paying people to fail, as a way to get them to make thematic statements doesn't work, I don't think. I've always had this problem with FATE, for instance. Instead I want to pay them for making thematically interesting moves, even if they happen to be congruent with tactically sound moves. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\nAnother theory of how to make such a game system work is to have two systems operating independently of each other. One rewards for good tactics, the other for good theme, and the points are used to fuel entirely different systems. You can't use the rewards from the tactical system in the thematic, and (maybe more important, if you believe in the power of gamism bleed) you can't use the rewards from good thematic decisions to enhance your chances of tactical success. <br>\n<br>\nBut that has two problems. First, what is this other thematic system? What do you use the rewards for? Second, if, in fact tactical play tends to corrupt thematic play, and both priorities are available constantly, won't things slide to gamism? If not, then don't you have a strong case of potential incoherence in play? Perhaps not if the player simply makes it clear which reward he's trying to obtain? <br>\n<br>\nCall this the fast-transition method: before any conflict, the player states which sort he wants it to be, tactical or thematic. If he chooses tactical we use the tactical system and give tactical rewards. If he chooses thematic, we use a thematic system and give thematic rewards. <br>\n<br>\nAgain, key to this would be that the rewards for using the thematic system could never benefit the player when using the tactical system. Begging the question as to what such rewards would be (in form and function). <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is why I've sorta settled on a cycle as the viable method. In the end, the rewards do end up being tactical. But in the interim, we award them only for thematic (or other) sorts of activity. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe temptation to use the "bad tactics reward" is strong. Because it can be created objectively. In IAWA, you use your less powerful abilities, and if they're less than your opponent, you've obviously made a suitably bad tactical decision. No judgment involved. But the problem being that it's just hidden gamism in this case, a queen sacrifice to win three turns later. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo am I right in demarking this dichotomy? Is it different to reward tactically unsound play, as opposed to rewarding thematically good play, in terms of the actual agenda that's created? If, in the end, the resulting reward is more or less the same in function? <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143287/#Comment_143287" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T09:02:17+00:00" title="May  9, 2008  9:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2008 9:03AM by C_Edwards.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rewarding tactically unsound play just doesn't compute for me. Your tactics are either sufficient to succeed at achieving a goal or they are not. If they're not, no cookie for you. You don't get the uber loot, you don't get the XP, whatever. Doesn't matter why you're making a certain decision or move, only what outcome the system is going to reward.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn that note, the bleed-over in rewards from thematic to tactical isn't going to just be a meta-currency issue. If I defeat the lich-king in thematic mode, then I take his stuff, I've just gained rewards to use in tactical play. Of course that's all dependent on the crunchy bits you have in mind for the tactical side, and limits placed upon the thematic side.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave you given any thought to a centralized reward currency that is gained from all modes of play and can then be spent for mode specific advantages? It might be workable if you gain less of the currency in the thematic mode and/or it costs more to purchase tactical mode advantages. May be hard to balance though.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Chris                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Approaching El Dorado from the North - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6438/approaching-el-dorado-from-the-north/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Approaching El Dorado from the North - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6438/approaching-el-dorado-from-the-north/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Chris, yeah, tactical bleed in terms of situation is a concern.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chris, yeah, tactical bleed in terms of situation is a concern. I keep using bad terminology with this, however, which may be confusing. That is, I'm not actually thinking of allowing players to resolve anything that's non zero-sum with thematic play. So, in fact, if having the lich's stuff is tactically beneficial, then it can only be obtained through tactical play. The results of thematic play can't give them to you... unless you give up something else equally important. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this is situation. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat is, the outcomes in question gives the character a seeming advantage in terms of situation, we have two options:<br/>\n<br/>\nEither give him a bonus for that situation, and then you have definite tactical bleed. Or<br/>\nIgnore the situational effect until and unless paid for with tactical currency. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm prone to taking the latter approach. Think effects-first Hero System design. You don't get it unless you pay for it. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, let's say that we figure out a zero-sum solution for defeating the lich, but this leaves the lich's treasure unguarded. There's no reason in the in-game fiction that we can't just walk off with is magic ball of wondrous power. Well, it's OK to narrate walking off with it, even getting into another fight with it present. But then we either concoct some reason that it's not working, or we simply ignore it's mechanical effects (though we can still narrate in effects) until such point as the player pays to add it to his character. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis goes for any situational advantage. If I'm narrated as a result of a combat as being uphill from you, and I want the bonus from it, I have to buy it or otherwise obtain it by engaging the tactical system to do so. We have to devise a contest to see if you can obtain that advantage. Roll vs your tactics to make use of the height advantage. That sort of thing. <br/>\n<br/>\nMake sense? <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for a central currency, that's got bleed written all over it. "Bean Counting" as Ron would call it, with exchange rates in order to try to balance. Never works that I've seen. But if you can give a more specific example, perhaps I can see better what you're getting at. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the currency wasn't cyclical, it might work as a pacing thing. That is, if you can't get any as a result of any sort of play, but are just refreshed at session start or something, then it becomes just a way for the player to meter out what sort of play he wants. <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, the problem there is that you might get some players doing only one sort of play, then, however. I'm ambivalent about that. One side of me says to let em play the way they want whenever.

If your plan (as a player) is to "say something" (in the Lit 101 sense) using the encounter with the lich king, then it would not go to tactics at all, and it would be settled in some other manner, without gain or loss.

"That's cool that you leapt into the firey pit, you get extra dice!" The problem with this method is that it means that we're not longer at all judging the tactical acumen of the player, but have gone totally over to narrativism. We're rewarding the cool, not penalizing the tactically unsound.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI couldn't possibly disagree with you more.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe skill at creatively coming up with something "cool" such that it earns a reward is every bit as gamist facilitating as the skill at using "sound tactics".<br/>\n<br/>\nI think this is also reflected in your distaste for the term "Step on Up" to describe gamism.  In my view, Step on Up is EXACTLY the right phrase to describe gamism.  And there are numerous ways to Step on Up.  Stepping Up simply means bringing the awesome, and being acknowledged by your peers for having done so in spades.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I stepped up with my cool narrative description such that everybody acknowledges my profound contribution to an amazing session...that's every bit as gamist facilitating as if I carefully used cover modifiers to safely advance against an entrenched pill box.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think alot of your issues and perceived areas of conflict would disappear by simply acknowledging a broader definition of Gamism that permits competition using soft factors as well as hard.  There was never any intention in any of the Big Model discussions to limit Gamism only to the manipulating of hard factors.<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143315/#Comment_143315" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T12:33:19+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 12:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2008 12:48PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very theoretically, yes, Marshall. (Crossposted with Ralph)<br>\n<br>\nBut people are obviously getting the impression that the thematic mechanics are a resolution system, when that's not neccessarily the case. You can do other thematic stuff that simply doesn't resolve anything like an external threat. <br>\n<br>\nFor instance, attempting to take out the lich king would use tactics to accomplish. If the player wanted to shift to thematic play at that point, we could orchestrate a situation in which the lich has two hostages, a friend and a family member, and the character has to choose between the two of them as to which he wants to try to save first. Neither choice of which is mechanically advantageous. In making the choice, the player is using his character to make a statement about, say, whether his character values friends or family more. <br>\n<br>\nThen we might switch back to tactical play, to resolve who he actually saves. <br>\n<br>\nActually that's not too bad... positive stake selection (or even prioritization) as potential for the thematic part of play? Hmm.<br>\n<br>\nYou can even have a mechanical value for the goals, the friend is a 4 and the family member is an 8 in terms of motivation. What the thematic play does is to switch their values. So you always end up with the superior number in play, it's merely a question of which thing ends up with the superior number, a decision that can only be thematic then. <br>\n<br>\nAcutally that's pretty well integrated. <br>\n<br>\nWhich is a good segue into the next point. I want for the narrations to make a difference. Even in tactical play. But how do you do that rigorously? One way is to have players pay metagame currency to make the narration count (very Universalis, this). In a way, this is very "Nomic" (the game where you make up the rules as you go). <br>\n<br>\nI'm also visualizing using an "engine" concept. Players have cards on which they have their charater's abilities listed, along with the rules that go along with the ability. Think of it as a "purchase a feat" sort of system. Purchase feats ahead of time and it's cheap. Do it during a conflict, and it costs extra. <br>\n<br>\nThis goes along with the worldbuilding, sorta. So you'd pay for it with points from the worldbuilding part of play? Like "I created part of the world that everybody enjoys, now the world pays me back by showing where I'm effective and how?"<br>\n<br>\n<br/>\nThe reason for the concern regarding wanting narration to matter is that I've noted that where you have hard mechanics, often narration goes by the wayside. I'm actually not all that concerned about narration itself per se... I find it fine to have players make declarations of character actions. What I'm really concerned about more is the question of emphasizing creative action declaration, be it by narration or not. Basically I want players to invent new maneuvers, potentially an infinte number of them given that narration could be anything. This incentivizes players to come up with new maneuvers that have new effects. Accomplished by having the world-building reward only be able to do this, and not being able to give advantage in any other way. <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that the maneuver then becomes theoretically universally doable, the player is not only giving his own character this ability, but is giving everyone this ability. <br/>\n<br/>\nSounds interesting, but it might lead strongly to the "If my character knew he could do that, he would have done it." To which you'd have to respond, "Then you should have thought of that before!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with this, again, comes with deciding whether or not the rule itself is aesthetically pleasing. Players could just make any rule up to go with any maneuver, if there's no way of policing them on it. Meaning that there's really no reason to come up with a creative description at all. The player says, "I hit it REALLY hard this time, so that gives me a +1" Next time "I hit it REALLY REALLY hard." <br/>\n<br/>\nCharacter facility with such an ability would have to be purchased from challenge empowerment currency. That is it benefits everyone or nobody equally, until such point as the player makes it slanted in his character's favor because, say, the character is actually skilled in whatever it is. <br/>\n<br/>\nBasically payment of the world-building currency is to allow for the ability in question (or situational bonus, or whatever) to be useful in the situation of play in question. <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143318/#Comment_143318" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T12:47:22+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 12:47PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ... from above. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn another related subject, going with Josh's notion of complexity of goals and such, I'm thinking that players can try to angle for multiple goals. And that these can change during resolution. Again, this varies from stake-setting prior to the contest in several ways. Most notably, the player doesn't have any direct understanding of what they stand to lose, other than that it'll be appropriate to the contest at hand in some way. Even if unexpected. (I'm hoping, in fact, that the negative results of conflict end up being very surprising, in fun ways). <br/>\n<br/>\nMy current idea for resolution, then, revolves around using something not totally dissimilar to the rules for games like Puerto Rico (or the space version, even better). Basically players can use action during resolution to orient their character's actions towards achieving some goal. But they do so by building "factories" that head in that direction, and then put fuel in, to make them produce, and then these products are then traded in for the thing sought. <br/>\n<br/>\nTactics, then, involve blocking player's abilities to advance a particular goal by taking the resources that they need to either start up production towards he goal, or the initiative to convert, etc. Thus, working with the idea above, "manuevers" might be the equivalent of "factories" that take certain sorts of "effort" and convert them into certain sorts of "advantages" (products), which are then traded in for victory. Other actions might be the acts to do the conversion. <br/>\n<br/>\nThus a "feint" sets up an opponent so that you can get an advantage on him that you can then convert to damage on the opponent. Wheras the actual stab maneuver is the conversion of the position advantage to the damage. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's fun about this sort of thing, of course, is that it allows for the multi-variate outcomes that we want. A player may get some of what he wants out of a conflict. Or none of it, or all of it. And his opponent may get none, some or all as well, of what he's seeking to get. And you'd also get intricate detail of how the maneuvers were working against each other, as opposed to just "it worked for 5," or "it failed." Instead you get, "My counter made his feint not only fail to be productive in changing the situation to his advantage, but actually set me up to have an opportunity to lauch my own maneuver." <br/>\n<br/>\nThoughts?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143320">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143320/#Comment_143320" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-09T12:54:45+00:00" title="May  9, 2008 12:54PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following the above to address Ralphs' point. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe may have to agree to disagree here, Ralph. But I think that my definition is not unique to me. In any case, where I'm drawing the line is where my problems occur. So you can tell me to define gamism a certain way all you like, but that's not going to change the problem that I have. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf it helps, drop those terms, and start using local definitions to this thread. I'll even use a different term than gamism if it helps (I've been trying to avoid it, in fact). But the conundrum to be solved still exists, and, well, I'm going to try to fix it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't see a problem, I'm not surprised... the discomfort in question may be somthing that few others besides myself feel. Just as there are those who don't seem to believe that there's any such thing as creative agenda incoherency at all, might disagree with you if you said there was (I think you buy into the concept of CA, right?). It's only a problem for those for whom it's a problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, again, apologies to anybody who feels mislead by any of my rhetoric or terminology use. I think it's still an interesting and even important topic.

If it's a total success, then it carries the full weight of all that Stuff; if it's, say, a half success, then it only carries half the weight, but if there was a lot of stuff then that could be pretty darn good anyway.  On the other hand, if it's a total failure then all that stuff could swing over to the other guy's pile.  Is that what you're talking about?  'Cause that sounds neat.

It will probably be possible to go for big rewards with simple strategies. And these may even work in some cases where you have some sort of advantage, or your opponent plays badly. It's less about the complexity of the strategy, and more about how much action a player decides to devote to setting up goals, as opposed to advancing them. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn some ways this is the standard "Guns or Butter" dichotomy that you find in many strategic games. Do I build units now, or the resources with which I'll be able to build more and better units later? Wait too long to get the good units, and the opponent may already have made moves that give him the tactical advantage, and then he's making my preparations useless. Go too soon, and I may find myself delayed just long enough that when I finally get there, my opponent has more and better waiting for me, the tables are quickly turned, and now I have to contend with the fact that I haven't made extensive preparations. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCallan, <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't want "stories" per se. Not at all. Sorry, once again, if my rhetoric seems to indicate that I do. What I want is to have situation exist where players can have fun making thematic decisions. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is often, I think, what throws a lot of people who approach "Story-games" both this site, and the games that we term story-games. I think that they feel that we have an over-engineered approach to creating stories that has to be unfun because it's so... planned... for lack of a better word. I think that it's seen as non-spontaneous. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs has been pointed out, many people feel that story can be a side-effect of gamism play. And, sure, I think that's non-controversial. This is why, when we pointed this out to Ron, that he changed the definition of "Narrativism" from being about creating a story, to being "Story now." What he's saying is that the decisions made in such play are based on thematic considerations made at the moment of contact in play. Just as we have to make tactical decisions based on the tactical situation that occurs in gamism from the unforseen collision of forces that occurs, in narrativism we have to make decisions based on what's thematically interesting as play evolves, and at the moment that the decision becomes available.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, we often decry any planning as Ron would call it "playing before you play." It's not only that what we're interested in isn't "Story After" (which is what you get from piecing together the events created in play to see how they turned out to be thematically interesting), and it's not that we want it to be "Story Before" (where you plan the story, and there is no suspense), but it's "Story Now" created in play and at the moment of play. <br/>\n<br/>\nLet my put this in another, hopefully very simple way to understand it. I want to be able to make a decision that seems "thematically right" to me for the character (including him making bad decisions, for instance), and not have to worry that I'm looking like a buffoon for having done something tactically unsound. I don't want to have to take tactics into consideration at all, outside of plausibility. <br/>\n<br/>\nNot at that moment. <br/>\n<br/>\nConversely, choices that are tactical can seem very wrong at times to players expecting not only plausibility, but theme creation. <br/>\n<br/>\nI just want for there to be a way to do both, and have players understand when it's one, and when it's the other, and both be fun for everyone involved. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your question is deeper, like "why do we like thematic play?" I can only ask "Why do we like tactical play?" In the end it's either self-given pats on the back that you liked your own play, or social rewards given by the other players, that make us want to do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy do people like this sort of thing? Well that's getting into psychology and such, and I'm not sure we really have to get into that, do we? I mean, if you don't understand Opera, and why people like it, does it do any good to try to explain it to you? Shouldn't it suffice for our purposes here that we just understand that it is something that we like? I actually have worked to come up with an answer to this question, but I'm not sure the "why" really matters much.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically, if you want to look at the underlying question of why "story" or "theme creation" is fun, you should probably take it to another thread. For this one, I don't think I'm being unfair by asking us to simply assume that it's something that players like myself want from play. Or have you discerned that there's something essential to the question of the motivation to create the story that needs to be answered? If not, then "it's fun" will have to suffice. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143624/#Comment_143624" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-12T19:00:56+00:00" title="May 12, 2008  7:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 12, 2008 7:05PM by Callan_S.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mike,<br/><br/>I had been reading it that you were using 'story' as shorthand for thematic choices/story now stuff.<br/><br/>I've read your post carefully...let me run a couple of examples past you. One is playing poker, with beads from a bead jar as the stakes. Now, this is reasonbly fun and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Okay, the second example is playing poker, with a real amounts of money on the line (not cents, real money).<br/><br/>The latter example can be incredibly exciting and thrilling, or alternatively devistatingly heartwrenching (Note: Here I'm refering to heartwrenching, but not unhealthily so - ie, not losing the rent money, but being stung all the same).<br/><br/>In the second example, it's not really accurate to say 'Poker was the thing that was exciting! It was the source of that hightened excitement!'. It wasn't making that excitement. What is exciting is each players real life changing during each moment of play, in terms of money and how it affects our RL personal goals. I hope we can agree on this, the rest of the post uses it as a basis.<br/><br/>Now, lets take a roleplay game about thematic choices just for the sake of it. That's reasonably fun and enjoyable. But imagine something comes up in play that just rocks your understanding of your own real life - some insight that strikes straight to the bone. Perhaps your playing the knights/beligerant king game from my last post, and although you hated your boss, now you can just see him trying to make up for his own weakness. You've seen something you'd never have seen otherwise - it's rather like winning money, in a way. In terms of him, your real life personal goals are furthered - you understand how to deal with him much better.<br/><br/>Now if that was just thrilling and exciting and wonderful - like the poker example, it's missplaced to say roleplaying itself was that thrilling and exciting. Roleplay wasn't exciting - it's that your own real life goals were furthered (like getting a wad of cash would further your goals).<br/><br/>As I said in the last post: I'm wondering if certain game sessions for you were awesome because they touched on a practical, real life meaning for ya. And now your trying to get back to that awesomeness through technique, trick, stance, turn order, competition, a whole bunch of game design stuff. When really, it'll never be exciting unless it has some practical, real life meaning to you. That's what spiked the punch.<br/><br/>Basically I'm getting down to design fundimentals, when your ready to get into choosing what techniques and stuff apply. I know it's a pain in the arse - it's like me asking 'Are cars good?' when you've already bought a car and not only that, you'd like some help finding a damn parking space - it doesn't seem very helpful of me. So in that note, I'll leave it with you on this post. Hope I kept it relatively small and not thread diverting - I tried to, how well did I do on that?

I don't think it matters at all why it's fun, and it's all the same in play. Sure intensity might be greater or less at times, but I think that'll be catch as catch can. I'm not going to try to design to obtain life-changing moments, especially since I have no idea how I'd go about doing that. Any more than any artist has an idea of how to do it other than to try hard in their medium. I don't think that I can create a medium that will make people more likely to address their own personal issues, nor is that what I'm about. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe game will hopefully be just as fun when answering thematic questions like, "Which magic sword is coolest!" Which isn't to say that the player can't ramp up the stakes for himself. Just that it's not something that I'm concerned with. Yeah, I've got a car, and I want a car. I don't think the flying car is practicable. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJesse, I hope your question is probative, intentionally asking if my idea is X, so as to get me to correct it. Otherwise I'm left with the assumption that I'm communicating pretty badly. Which may well be the case. You'll forgive me, this isn't an easy subject to approach. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut to answer your question directly... a game like what you're talking about would probably suffice in some small way to meet my criteria. But described the way you're describing it, it would be the "least good" version of such a game. Your proposal catches the essence of what I'm doing, yes, and so might make a good analogy. But what I envision would be far from what your example makes me envision. <br/>\n<br/>\nFor one, the "cutscenes" might end up being most of the scenes of play. So in some instances of play you'd get "cutscene" after "cutscene" occasionally punctuated by a challenge (making them really just scenes). In some play. Basically I want player input to at least partially determine the rate at which each of these sorts of play occurs. So if the player is feeling like a challenge, he can press for that. If he's feeling like making a thematic statement, he can press for an opportunity for doing that. Much more organic than in a video game in the transitions. Yes, with a system that tends to incentivize doing more than one sort of scene... but not where we have any enforced pacing. <br/>\n<br/>\nSuch a game, if designed like that from the ground up might be interesting. But it's not at all what I'm striving for. <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a paradoxical statement. While I want the game to be different in how it supports transition from mode to mode, I also want it to look in play a whole lot like playing most other RPGs. I'm sure that what I'm proposing makes it sound very different, but I'm not trying to create some new paradigm of action in play. Just trying to get at functional transition with the least amount of interference from what else we find fun in play. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat may be giving you a wrong impression is that I keep talking about the reward from gamism beign something like having the opportunity of doing a "thematic scene." But that's just a placeholder idea, really. Mechanically I want it simply to be a choice by the player made at some point that is zero-sum. So instead of having a whole new scene, we can just have a single decision that's backed up mechanically by the rules to make it clear what the agenda is. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, basically I want to be able to "transition on the fly" if at all possible. I don't want it to be some clunky, inelegant thing where we have to say ritual phrases or something to get players to understand what's going on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, optimally, the rules should not require any explanation on my part as to the notion that any switch is happening at all. It should merely be apparent from the rules of play what's going on. The stilted mental example I have is like:<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer A: I use a feint.<br/>\nGM: Cool, that causes the opponent to fall for it, and you gain one position point. What's your next action? <br/>\nPlayer A: Huh, know what? I think that right here in the middle of the fight my character has determined that he really doesn't care about the princess at all, and is really all about killing this guy. <br/>\nGM: Aha, so you can chase him if he runs away!<br/>\nPlayer: Yeah, exactly. That'll piss off the princess, but my character doesn't care. In fact I think that he's falling for Olga. <br/>\nGM: Really? <br/>\nPlayer: Yeah... I'm going to spend a value point on changing his "Save the Princess" value to "Get Count Snide." <br/>\nGM: Sweet. OK, spend the point, and mark that down... OK, now what's his next action? <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143666/#Comment_143666" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T06:52:13+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  6:52AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2008 6:53AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote in the example how, as I've said, I'm not at all concerned with in-game narration of what's going on. There may be ways for players to incentivize this themselves if it's what they want, but I'm not putting in any narration mechanics per se. What I'm more interested in is having stuff available about which the player can make decisions. In the example, there's no mechanical advantage to making the decision to switch values, it only dictates what arenas the player is allowed to enter for challenge. <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment I'm sorta worried that the "Arenas" idea is weak. Basically limiting player choice in order to focus on it. I'm very willing to hear ideas of what else I can do with "values" or the like that might be mechanically more interesting to players. Again in such a way so as to not cause bleed.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne idea that I think is problematic, is allowing players to "power up" in things related to their selected values. Not such that they can use them immediately, but long-term. I worry, however, that this becomes once again, "EXP for Roleplaying." Goes straight past the world-building buffer to the challenge play. Might work if done right? How about the previous idea where player is allowed to do worldbuilding where his character has relevant values? Or is that just too odd to be engaging? <br/>\n<br/>\nOther ideas? <br/>\n<br/>\nI've got most of a draft written for a rules set. Very sketchy at this point, and full of holes mechanically, but it may serve to be illustrative. I hope to post it soon. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143812/#Comment_143812" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-13T18:21:21+00:00" title="May 13, 2008  6:21PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2008 8:45PM by Callan_S.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mike,<br/><br/>I've read you through a second time and I think I missread your goal.

Because it's that shift that, for me, is the dealbreaker to having both competitive GAME play and structured STORY play.<br/><br/>I thought this was an interesting statement:\n<blockquote>I want to be able to make a decision that seems "thematically right" to me for the character (including him making bad decisions, for instance), and not have to worry that I'm looking like a buffoon for having done something tactically unsound. I don't want to have to take tactics into consideration at all, outside of plausibility.</blockquote>\n"Look like a buffoon" to whom? Yourself? Your other players? The (implied) audience of the events as they unfold?<br/><br/>That sort of desire seems very much like the moment in a horror movie when the unsuspecting teen goes down in the cellar with only a flashlight to investigate a noise. The audience is either all, "No! Stupid! Get out of there and come back with a gun!" or they're gripped by the uncertainty and fear created by the setup. The former want their hero to be smart and capable, even at the expense of good character-driven drama. The latter wants good character-driven drama, even if that means the character acts foolishly.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143999/#Comment_143999" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T12:47:49+00:00" title="May 14, 2008 12:47PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, <br/>\n<br/>\nYou seem to be talking about what we sometimes call Author Stance and Actor Stance. What we've observed for a while now is that, while many seem to suspect that Author Stance facilitates narrativism, in fact either stance works fine for some in either mode of play. So... it really doesn't matter to me which stance players have. I'm going to assume that both are going on, and I want the game to be "immune" from perception problems that stem from players shifting back and forth. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow "Pawn Stance" on the other hand is a different story. That being where the player does implausible things in the name of winning (like having characters act with player-only knowledge). That I'd like to discourage for aesthetic reasons, which I've touched on. Basically that I feel that RPGs lose an important unique characteristic that I want to see in play, when play becomes this way. But as for the other stances I'm not concerned. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for looking like a buffoon, that was colorful and not quite accurate. Your example sorta catches the essence of it, though imperfectly. In a movie, it's not a competition at all. It's not about whether or not the character acts stupid or not, it's actually whether or not the player acts "stupid" in the context of winning. In "challenge play" as I've called it, if a player does something that causes his character to fail because he wasn't smart, you chide him for not having played better. In thematic play, if a player does something to cause his character to fail because it makes a fun thematic statement, you applaud him for having done that well.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't know which it is, then you don't know how to measure success, your own or others. And then you don't know what to applaud or chide about. Worse, you worry about your move, not knowing what's expected of you, and fearing that you'll play one way or the other, and get chided for it, the other being expected. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo give an actual play example that I frequently recall, I was playing a Hobgoblin Fighter/Priest character in a Planescape game. At one point we came up to some elves, and I'd written all sorts of background about how my character's people had all sorts of problems with elves. So I had him act all paranoid around them, and generally screwed up negotiations with them. To which some of the players eventually said that I should just shut up because I was ruining our chances with the elves. Not in character... that would have suited me fine. But the players told me, the player, that I was playing badly, and they wondered why I was playing that way, and would I please cease and desist? <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, the game was purely gamism going on, and that should have been obvious to me. It certainly was after this incident. But there I was, feeling like a buffoon for basically doing a different activity from what everybody else at the table was doing. Like we're doing a play like "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and I'm doing it as a musical version. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't blame the other players. If anyone is to blame it's me for not conforming to the expectation of play. But the real culprit was the presentation of the game by the game-master, who said that there was lots of "role-playing" in it. To this day I can only guess that by "role-playing" he meant the way in which he gave colorful anime descriptions of the characters' attacks in combat. I should have gone by the system indications, which were all 100% gamism. <br/>\n<br/>\nLive and learn. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, the point is that by giving strong enough mechanical signals you can indicate what sort of play is going on... even mechanically incentivize it such that positive feedback is given for the right sort of play, which not only reinforces that sort of play at those times when the system is being engaged, but it informs everyone what sort of play is going on, so that the social reinforcements are appropriate as well. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144001/#Comment_144001" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T12:53:59+00:00" title="May 14, 2008 12:53PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/><br/>Yes, my question was probative.

It is the single most important nut that needs to be cracked.</blockquote>\nTaken at face value, this seems trivially easy: You base the competition around the drama, and not character-level accomplishment. This has in fact been done several times with varying success. I don't know Capes but I understand this is the core of play. Burning Wheel, arguably, approaches this (by tying its reward system so tightly to thematic, rather than literal, accomplishments). One of the new subsystems in Mouse Guard, assuming it hasn't changed since playtest, goes even further.<br/><br/>But obviously those solutions aren't working for you. I assume this is because it shifts the assumption of the competition away from the characters, and away from the literal contents of the game's fiction. You win when your character defeats a dragon, rather than achieving aesthetic satisfaction by making it a tough and unpredictable fight in the first place. Or by arranging events such that this particular dragon was the one that ate your father, and the fact your character is now facing it is itself a victory.<br/><br/>Just so I'm clear, can I assume that when you talk "competition" you're talking about character-level accomplishment? IE your measurement of success or failure is derived from the player's performance in the game via his character?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144010/#Comment_144010" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-14T13:23:05+00:00" title="May 14, 2008  1:23PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.

I'd say it is probably as close to a Gamist/Narrative hybrid as anything's gotten so far.  When I've played Capes I've always played hard to win and have never "thrown" a conflict just to make a statement, unless it was a part of a larger strategy to get what I really wanted at a later time.  The key to that is that mechanical rewards are only won from other players (not given but actally won) only if you are pushing their thematic buttons.  So, the mechanically optimal thing to do is always to do the things that are the most relevant thematically to the other players and their optimal strategy is to do things that are thematically relevant to you.  <br><br>Just throwing that in there.<br><br>Andrew                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144191/#Comment_144191" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T11:16:57+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 11:16AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andrew,<br/>\n<br/>\nCapes, like Blood Red Sands, as well-thought-out designs, and very clear designs, have been helpful to me insamuch as they've allowed me to pinpoint the problem in question. That is, they do seem to approach this point, but for me they fall short in some very fine particulars. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich is to say that they'll work great for lots of folks, and it's only folks like me who find them to be problematic. I've spent a lot of time trying to elucidate the particular problems... does that still need work? Or does it suffice if I say that Capes and BRS don't manage to accomplish what I'm looking for?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJesse, <br/>\n<br/>\nWell... it's starting to look like that in my sample design (playing "Well" to accomplish character goals). But that's a problem. I want more lattitude. I want players to be allowed to play "Poorly" at times in order to make a thematic statement. I don't know if that's represented now. Mechanically what I'm thinking is that, basically, we don't mechanically penalize the player for having the character make the "bad" decision, we actually reward him for doing so... not in terms of something that'll make him more likely to win, but with something else. In the meanwhile, the act actually has zero mechanical consequences to whether or not the character wins. That is, it might seem like a tactically terrible idea, but we don't penalize the player for it at all, just as we don't reward the player in a way that'll help him win. His odds remain precisely the same. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo... a character is fighting for his life, but sees a friend go down in battle. It probably makes no tactical sense to do so, but the player wants to have his character go over and hold the body of his fallen comrade. Even at risk to his own life. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, in the example, it's powerful for the player to do so, if it means that he's actually risking his character. But if we take away his character for doing so, then we've strongly penalized the player for having made that thematic decision. This is a tough design decision. Do you take away the chance of failure, and even reward the tactically unsound, yet thematically fascinating, decision? Or do you allow the statement to be the stronger for the player having assumed an actual risk? <br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment, I'm leaning towards the side that says reward, because I think that the behavior will actually be what we want - players will do the thematic thing when appropriate. With penalties, the standard method, you tend to see play devolve into constant gamism. Or that's been my expeience. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo mechanically what I currently have for the example is that the player pays one of his points gained from good challenge play, to take a "time out" from any challenges, so to speak, and explain how the character is making a decision between two values. In the example, the player erases "Defend My Life" and puts in, instead, "Revenge for Bob's Death" or something, explaining how seeing his friend fall, he goes over and holds his friend. The battle rages on about them, but miraculously everyone is too busy killing people holding swords to bother with a man holding a dying friend. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen the character gets angry, picks up Bob's sword, and launches back into the battle, and we're back into challenge play again, with all it's risks, and punishment for bad moves. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny clearer? <br/>\n<br/>\nContinued...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144195/#Comment_144195" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T11:43:53+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 11:43AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 12:02PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...from above. <br/>\n<br/>\nMarshall, thanks for the actual play example. That's not precisely transition, and it's not exactly what I want, either... but it has similarities. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you're describing is an overall "instance of play" that is gamism. Creative Agendas don't mean that players never make "atomic" (meaning singular) decisions based rationales that are other than that agenda. The common example is that atomically you might see a pattern like:<br/>\nG<br/>\nG<br/>\nN<br/>\nG<br/>\nG<br/>\nG<br/>\nN<br/>\nG<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich may, looking at what's rewarded in the end, give an overall agenda of gamism. The importance of looking at Creative Agendas this way - overall - is that it's the best predictor for what's expected by the other players. Heck, the N decisions may be congruent with good tactical play, and nobody worries whether they're just color, or if they're the "real" creative content being generated. But in the end, in your game, the accolades go to the winners. Right? Gamism. You never had anybody say, "Man, it was great how you engineered your character's continual failure showing his dedication to his father." Right? Gamism. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, what I'm looking for could be thought, in part, to be an atomic disection of the action, such that over time we're actually rewarding both socially. What's called "hybrid" play. That's not the same as saying that any particular atomic decision is being made and rewarded for two or more things. It's saying that decision A is rewarded for one thing, and decision B is rewarded for another. <br/>\n<br/>\nDoes that help? What I'm worried about is that the atomic leaping back and forth will either just get amalgamated into some overall Creative Agenda (likely gamism), or that play will be incoherent. That is, it may be difficult to impossible to "transition atomically" as it were. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul, <br/>\n<br/>\nFor you, another annecdote. Last Origins, I was playing in a scenario run by Luke Crane (generally spectacular fun, as usual). Our characters were supposed to tackle some dark renegade elves, very powerful. We get to the final confrontation, and end up fighting the lead bad-guy. And he's an ass-kicker. I'm having loads of fun describing my character fighting as I think he would in that situation. And we're losing, so, so badly. Luke steps in and tells us a strategy we could use to win - we all need to tackle the elf all in one big pile. But we ignore it for a round. It's looking like we're going to lose, the bad-guy is going to win. Luke entreats us again, telling us that we're foolish for not following the sound tactical advice he's giving. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhich made my actually angry. I'm thinking... no way my very dignified character, no matter how desperate, drops his sword and piles on to this other elf that he actually respects. Here I'd heard that Burning Wheel was all about the hard decisions that charaters make, and more importantly the ramifications thereof. But yet here I was hearing that I shouldn't play my character in the way that I thought was interesting, but in the way that would win. From the designer himself. <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, Burning Wheel doesn't do the job, either. You can blame me... I should realize that BW combat is very gamism oriented. The "failure" if any, is that I had no mechanical way to let Luke know that what I was doing was thematic in nature at the time. I should have made it clear verbally, but one doesn't think that way in play often. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo be very clear, TROS approaches this best in some ways, but also falls short. In other words, I've never encountered any game that satisfactorily deals with the problem that I have. And not for a lack of looking. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for how "winning" or "competition" yes, the question is how well the player manipulates the actions of his character such that he gets what he wants out of the challenges. Rewards (both power to address later challenges, and player thematic power). Does that answer that question? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. the sample game is still developing, including all of these ideas (to the extent that I can find ways to incorporate them). The hard part, at the moment is actually making an entertaining challenge portion of the game. The rest is pretty much ready.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144197/#Comment_144197" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T11:45:19+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 11:45AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/><br/>I kind of get it.

Think of it this way. I want to all-out compete at times. Other times I want to all-out make theme. When I want either of these, I want a game that clearly supports the one or the other. Makes sense, right? <br/>\n<br/>\nBut most of the time I want to do both, more or less at the same time. Using any one system, that clearly supports any one way to play can't possibly support both, right? So what you usually get is a system that supports just one well. Well, with indie games, that's typically the case. So when you're playing against the game's design, it feels wrong. Text that tells me to play against or without support*, because it's a good way to play, really irks me. e.g. The Window.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith traditional games you get the standard "Do what you want with it" incoherence. In which case the game alternately feels good and bad at times, but, worse, you're never sure if the decisions that you're making are going to be appreciated by the other players for what they are. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\n*This is why I can't stand freeform. Sure, there's nothing possibly "wrong" about doing what you want if there's no rule that says you can't do it. But that's far from saying that you feel like you're doing anything constructive when there's no rules to manipulate. Well, at least for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144203/#Comment_144203" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T12:00:44+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 12:00PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>What you're describing is an overall "instance of play" that is gamism.

For instance I edited this post to note this, and edited the last post to explain that the issue at hand wasn't all that much BW or Luke's fault (the original sounded a lot harsher than I meant).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144207/#Comment_144207" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T12:10:19+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 12:10PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, is your dissatisfaction with TROS that it is structured such that, in order to manipulate the rules to maximum effect and competence, you must do something thematically interesting, therefore, it's really all about theme almost all the time?<br/>\n<br/>\n-Marshall                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144210/#Comment_144210" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T12:19:09+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 12:19PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2008 12:21PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well... there are two readings of TROS. The "bonus dice on every roll" and the "bonus dice once in the pool" reading. Jake confirms what Ron suspected, that the latter reading is correct. If we go with that reading then there's a strong case for narrativism, because pretty much going into a situation in which you have lots of bonus dice, you're going to win. The challenge pretty much disappears when you're taking only two dice from your die pool, and adding 7 more to it. Not entirely, but the incentive is so massive that it's definitely makes play focus more on the decision-making. <br>\n<br>\nThe other problem I have is that this means that players don't have much of a spur of the moment decision-making ability, they pretty much have to follow their SAs - they're fools not to do so, penalized often with character death. This channeling of decisions is ameliorated somewhat by the fact that a player can change SAs on the fly to some extent. But the timing in the rules and the way they work, seem to me to militate against it. The narrativism just seems to come at the wrong times. And also can often be seen to be degenerate gamism in some cases (I want to win here, so the winning move is to say my character cares). <br/>\n<br/>\nNote that the game is so influential on my thinking in so nearly getting what I want, that my sample design has some distinct similarities. Playing the combat as gamism with roughly even sides in TROS rocks. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144214/#Comment_144214" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T12:35:41+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 12:35PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, is it possible that you've misdiagnosed the source of your discomfort?  By that I mean: if you say you're uncomfortable, then you're uncomfortable, but I'm having a great deal of trouble understanding the source.  I don't know if this is the same problem Jesse has, but I can't see it.  This dichotomy that you say makes you uncomfortable is present in every single game, RPG or otherwise, you've ever played.  Its present in every social interaction you've ever had.  So to point to that as the source of your discomfort is boggling to me.<br/><br/>The dichotomy is simply this:  you have a choice to make, that choice gives you something you want (an advantage to you) but has consequences.  Do you make the choice, take the advantage, and accept the consequences...or do you decide the consequences are too high -- or have the potential to be too high and so make a different choice.<br/><br/>I don't see any choice you make in Blood Red Sands or Capes that can't be described in that fashion...and I can't see any human activity where such choices are not an integral part.  In fact, I'd say every human being on the planet has been making that choice minute by minute since the day they were old enough to conceive thoughts.<br/><br/>In Blood Red Sands the choice looks like:  I can narrate this thing that will help my character acheive their goal and earn points to help me win.  But if I do, my friends might think I'm being lame.  Is the advantage to me worth taking the risk of those consequences?<br/><br/>In life the choice looks like:  I'd really like to tell my friends to be quiet so I can hear the game.  But if I do, my friends might think I'm being lame.  Is the advantage to me worth taking the risk of those consequences?<br/><br/>In Burning Wheel the choice might be:  There's a really cool thematic statement I can make here that will get some of my friends jazzed and they'll have loads of fun.  But if I do it, it might cost me the chance to defeat this powerful Elf guy and some of my friends will think I'm playing tactically poor.<br/><br/>In life the choice looks like:  There's this really cool opportunity I have to do something I've always wanted to do and some of my friends will be really excited and supportive.  But if I do it, it might cost mef the chance to advance my career financially and some of my friends will think I'm making a poor decision.<br/><br/><br/>Those choices look identical to me.  I can't conceive of a game that doesn't have these sorts of choices...I can't conceive of a social activity that doesn't have these choices and games are social activities.  Since you aren't made uncomfortable by those games, and since (IMO) those games all have these sorts of choices, I can't see how it's these choices that are what's making you uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Not trying to be obstructive, just laying out my thought process in the hopes that helps pinpoint more precisely the source of the issue.<br/><br/>Ralph                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144220/#Comment_144220" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T12:45:31+00:00" title="May 15, 2008 12:45PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part II<br/><br/>Or to come at it from the other side, I'm having trouble seeing the line / distinction you're making with "playing all out".<br/><br/>Does that mean that when you play all out you expect to be able to use every sneaky, dirty underhanded, even despicable trick that isn't expressly forbidden by the rules in order to win...and that any voluntary choice to not do this is not playing all out?<br/><br/>When you're playing a boardgame "all out", is it acceptable to kick him in the nuts during his turn in order to distract him from making his move.  Can you turn the stereo all the way up and put the speakers by his head.  Can you spray him with mace or wave smelly gym socks in his face?<br/><br/>Even though none of those things are expressly forbidden by the rules, I'm sure you've never done any of those things...meaning you've voluntarily agreed to abide by standards outside of the rules when playing the game...standards which are judged soley on what your fellow players deem acceptable (I'm sure there are groups playing Jungle Speed at this very moment, for whom kicking their opponent in the nuts is a perfectly viable game strategy).  Presumeably you still felt like you were playing "all out" even if you didn't take advantage of every sociably questionable action to win.<br/><br/>Can you help me understand how this voluntary choosing not to use questionable tactics in order to win is any different from voluntarily choosing not to use questionable tactics (like lame thematically inappropriate narration) to win in BRS?<br/><br/>I just don't see how one is ok but the other causes discomfort?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BiggerBoat" title="BiggerBoat"><img alt="BiggerBoat" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BiggerBoat">BiggerBoat</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144245/#Comment_144245" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T14:01:14+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  2:01PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting thread to me, because I've been thinking about something similiar in context with a WIP design. What I am trying to do is build a bit of a competitive atmosphere between the GM and the player(s). I'm trying to handle this by giving the players tools to manage their risk and rewards, and then giving the GM permisson to play as hard as they want. The players define the goals, the GM defines the risk, and if they fail the player can even choose to escalate the risk for another shot at success. I'm keeping this as purely a one GM/one player system for now, because that helps to declutter the complexity of the competitive elements.<br/><br/>One of the tricks is rewarding thematic play. Is thematic play its own reward (because cool narration and character-driven decisions are fun), or do you reward it mechanically?  Simple thematic narration is a tough issue. What encourages the players to lift the description of character actions and attitudes above the abstract mechanisms? In other games, the GM might reward some dice/bennies/experience for cool stuff and great role-playing. In a competitive atmosphere, why would the GM/players work against their own interests by rewarding other players? This is something I don't have an answer for yet, but I am starting to feel like there just isn't an easy mesh between thematic/narrative play and competitive/gamist play. There are just gray areas where you have to step outside of the competitive framework. It's like a friendly game of golf where you reward the other play with a few mulligans <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>But, I'd love to see it done well.<br/><br/>Some of the thematic issues I am handling by rewarding players for accomplishing their character's goals. and rewarding the GM for blocking those goals. The reward is the chance to create change within the character (because conflict leads to change). This is fairly thematic, as the GM and players come up with cool ways for the resolution of the conflict to create change within the characters. It provides opportunities for depth of play as characters react to those changes. The goals can be contrary to common sense, which would reward the player in a circumstance like you described above (rescuing a friend). I still am not happy with my work on this, but I feel like there is a kernel of promise somewhere in there.<br/><br/>On a smaller scale, there's also the old mechanism of giving narrative control to the "winner". The reward for good tactical play is having some fun with narration and taking control of the storyline. This does create a bit of a comeptitive vibe for players who like a narrative game, and I believe it supports your idea of tactical play which flows into narrative play. However, as you noted, there is too much judgment involved in setting up the tactical play and determining the results of the narrative play. I am trying to add a mechanical overlay which moderates the level of challenge and risk/reward. This helps a little but probably not enough for your goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144256/#Comment_144256" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T14:17:53+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  2:17PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike,<br/><br/>Thanks for indulging my questions. Some more thoughts, hopefully not tangential:<br/><br/>I'm sensing basically two, and possibly three, kinds of behaviors that can be rewarded, with numerous ways those rewards can be delivered.<br/><br/>You have tactical play: You're using all the resources available to your character balls-out, advocating on behalf of your character's success in every action he attempts moment-to-moment within the game fiction.<br/><br/>You have thematic play: You're using all the resources available as a player, advocating on behalf of your personal aesthetics as they present themselves in the game fiction.<br/><br/>The BW "problem" is that strong thematic play rewards you by making your tactical play more effective. You get Artha for playing toward the themes you've staked out, but that Artha is used to succeed in tactical ways.<br/><br/>The D&amp;D "problem" is that thematic play is generally disregarded. You play well tactically, you are rewarded with tactical-flavored XPs or, in some variations, with "hero points" or some other resource. In all cases, the reward is intended to make your character more tactically effective.<br/><br/>So what I'm not seeing is this: A system in which strong tactical play rewards you by making your <i>thematic</i> play more effective. IE the more your character succeeds on a task-by-task basis (by virtue of excellent tactical play by the player), the more the player expands his aesthetic footprint, as it were, on the game fiction. Instead of earning hero points for good tactical play (which simply reinforces your tactical play), perhaps you earn theme points.<br/><br/>I'm not sure exactly how you'd use those theme points because I'm not aware of a system that already exists with a similar mechanic. Maybe you bid theme points in a scene to define any given conflict's theme, what the conflict is "about". Maybe you can bribe fellow players to support the themes you care about: here's 2 theme points, now please let's have an in-game falling-out between our sibling characters. The sky's the limit, really, and the more I write this the more clearly I could see this working.<br/><br/>Or am I totally and completely on the wrong track?<br/><br/>p.<br/><br/>p.s. the third track would be the sim thing: using the resources available to you (or perhaps the group collectively) to "get it right." The more "right" you get a decision, the more you're rewarded -- maybe with tactical "points", maybe with theme "points".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144261/#Comment_144261" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-15T14:32:25+00:00" title="May 15, 2008  2:32PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>The D&amp;D "problem" is that thematic play is generally disregarded.</blockquote>\nIsn't the reward for that usually that the GM loosens the reins and starts following the player lead?<br/><br/>Not that this behavior is strictly D&amp;D related...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6438/approaching-el-dorado-from-the-north" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6438/approaching-el-dorado-from-the-north" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6438/approaching-el-dorado-from-the-north/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F6438%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F6438%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
