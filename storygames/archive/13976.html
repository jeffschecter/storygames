James Holloway's game art seems to always involve a lot of humor ans silliness, regardless of what game it was for. Froud, The Brothers Hildebrandt, all kinds of other people whose names I forget...each has a distinct feel to it and I would think that would be a very important part of the thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316722/#Comment_316722" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-15T11:37:11+00:00" title="March 15, 2011 11:37AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make a deck of cards for Ganakagok using art from another game, perhaps.<br/><br/><br/>It only takes a few clicks in Photoshop to make a given picture look like a paper cutout like the Fiasco playsets use for cover art.  Then you just make up your <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?t=545186" rel="nofollow">Shadowrun based playset</a> or whatever and play.<br/><br/><br/>Make a Wiki for the game, and have identifiable art for every major (N)PC, location, etc.<br/><br/><br/>In most cases, the art doesn't matter much beyond just straight inspirational material.  So you can use the art to inspire your game while using a different system (just like how you can play D&amp;D using Apocalypse World, or Star Wars with Polaris).  Most games don't use art for anything more... but if they do, you can steal art from elsewhere to do that as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
