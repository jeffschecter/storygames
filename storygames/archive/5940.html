It\u2019s a bit more freeform but I want to know where the flaws lie.<br/>\nIn standard D6 you pick a disadvantage and get a certain amount of points for it (very standard) I decided that instead of shopping for disadvantages that you would never use each player would get the max amount of point to build a character but they had to choose 3 disadvantages that best suit their character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe system below is my attempt at doing that. I have to give credit to Ken Burnside and Lenny Balsera for helping me along on the stuff below.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>DISADVANTAGE TYPES</b><br/>\nDisadvantages come in three varieties: Relationships, Internal, and External Problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers have five dice to allocate between three disadvantages. No more than 3 dice in one disadvantage, no less than one die in a disadvantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>RELATIONSHIP</b><br/>\nRelationships are disadvantages that involve one or more other people. If the hero has a needy lover that always wants attention then that is a relationship disadvantage.<br/>\nExamples include:<br/>\n\u2022\tAn enemy who wants to see the hero suffer or dead.<br/>\n\u2022\tAn elderly mother who needs constant attention<br/>\n\u2022\tA social obligation to a group of people who depend on her for protection<br/>\n\u2022\tA scorned lover<br/>\n\u2022\tA beautiful girl who doesn\u2019t know you exist but you admire from afar and protecting from trouble<br/>\n\u2022\tA lover who\u2019s trapped in the underworld, and you\u2019re expected to get her back out<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>INTERNAL</b><br/>\nThis type of disadvantage represents some type of quirk or mental limitation that makes it hard for others to interact with a character, or some type of psychological disability that makes certain actions more difficult.<br/>\nExamples include:<br/>\n\u2022\tAnger problems<br/>\n\u2022\tVows, or codes of conduct<br/>\n\u2022\tFlashbacks or night terrors<br/>\n\u2022\tDepression or paranoia<br/>\n\u2022\tLong winded or over confident<br/>\n\u2022\tPathological lying<br/>\n\u2022\tSubstance abuse<br/>\n\u2022\tLow self esteem<br/>\n\u2022\tCowardice<br/>\n\u2022\tA religious fanatic<br/>\n\u2022\tAtheism<br/>\n\u2022\tNarcissism<br/>\n\u2022\tGreed<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>EXTERNAL PROBLEMS</b><br/>\nThis category catches all the disadvantages that aren\u2019t relationships or internal Personality quirks.<br/>\nExamples include:<br/>\n\u2022\tPoverty<br/>\n\u2022\tA physical limitation such as one eye, or missing an arm<br/>\n\u2022\tBad luck<br/>\n\u2022\tA terrible secret<br/>\n\u2022\tDebt<br/>\n\u2022\tYoung or Old Age<br/>\n\u2022\tStrange appearance<br/>\n\u2022\tA vulnerability to a substance<br/>\n\u2022\tBeing a fugitive<br/>\n\u2022\tPolice record or shady background<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Iolaus Sample Disadvantages<b></b></i><br/>\nAs a young hero fresh off his home planet Iolaus\u2019 disadvantages look like this<br/>\nType-\t                -Priority-\t-Notes-<br/>\n<u>Relationship</u>\t2D\tHesperos the butcher. The butcher is a pirate ringleader who sold Iolaus into slavery with the Zorans years ago.<br/>\n<u>Personality</u>\t1D\tHot blooded. Iolaus is quick to anger when challenged or crossed<br/>\n<u>External</u>\t2D\tIndebted. Iolaus owes a debt to Strategus Dylon for saving his life. Sometimes Dylon uses the debt to bend Iolaus to his will making him do things he would normally not do<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nDisadvantages are brought into play by the player for a few reasons:<br/>\n1.\tIt makes the game more interesting and allows the player to inject a bit of drama<br/>\n2.\tIt spotlights an aspect of a character that a player would like to explore<br/>\n3.\tIt gives a player bonus dice to roll in the scene equal to the number of dice in the disadvantage.<br/>\nThe player is in total control of when and if the drawback is used If the player never uses the disadvantages during the course of the game that is his option \u2013 but what fun is that? One, his character will never grow, and two he will never get to take advantage of the bonus dice the disadvantages give him.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>WHEN CAN THE DISADVANTAGE BE USED?</b><br/>\nThe player may call upon the disadvantage in any situation. The GM must approve it but when activated the hero is essentially bringing down the pain upon his own character, creating drama in the plot. Because he is in some way causing trouble for himself he gets disadvantage dice that he may bank and use at a later date. These Disadvantage dice act in the same way as character points but they must be used before the end of the game or they are lost.<br/>\nThe hero may activate a disadvantage only once per game and no more than 5 dice per game can be acquired in this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Example: Iolaus is at a symposium during the course of the adventure and his player, Tyrone Bigums, decides that this might be the perfect time to garner some bonus dice for use later in the game.  Tyrone decides that Iolaus runs into his arch rival Hesperos (Relationship 2D). The GM approves the actions and starts to play out the scene of Hesperos\u2019 entrance and eventual confrontation with Iolaus. The scene is role played to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, ending with Iolaus garnering 2 dice for later use.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nOnce the disadvantage dice are used they are gone and can only be replenished if the hero activates the disadvantage again. The player may do this again later with his other disadvantages and receive disadvantage dice until he hits his Max (5 dice), calling on his 1 die disadvantages to max out his limit of five dice per adventure. Disadvantage dice must be spent during that adventure or they are lost and must be activated again during later adventures.<br/>\nGMs may try to activate a disadvantage because of plot developments, and if the player agrees to his disadvantages being activated he receives the disadvantage dice (up to his max). If the player doesn\u2019t want the disadvantages activated he may spend dice out of his Disadvantage dice pool to buy off the activation. If the hero does not have dice to spend he may either spend actual character points or take one Fate point.<br/>\nThese disadvantages are what helps define who and what your hero is and should be role played when activated. Since there is no mechanic for what these disadvantages do it is up to the player and the GM to define how they limit or hinder the player. The dice priorities are a good benchmark for how serious the problem is. If a hero decides that his Sworn Enemy (Relationship) is worth 1D then he is not much of a hindrance compared to his alcohol addiction 3D (Personality). In this latter case, the GM may decide that the hero has -3D to all rolls unless she is drinking or completely wasted on cheap box wine. No matter what the case, the disadvantage should be role-played.<br/>\nWhen can I use these dice?<br/>\nThe disadvantage dice may be used anytime after the disadvantage is activated. The dice may be used in part or whole as the player sees fit. If the player has managed to activate 4D worth of disadvantages he may use the four dice all on one roll or may split the dice up evenly between four individual rolls or any combination thereof.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>CHANGING DISADVANTAGES</b><br/>\nDuring the course of several adventures some disadvantages will become more important while others will become less so or even irrelevant. If this occurs the player may shuffle the dice priorities or even change the disadvantages to new ones. This should be discussed with the GM.<br/>\nIt is perfectly acceptable to have more than 3 disadvantages but heroes only receive dice for the top three most pressing disadvantages in their lives. If a player wants, and the GM approves, a hero can have multiples of a type of disadvantage.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Example: Iolaus wants to switch his disadvantages around. He decides that he will have two Relationship disadvantages (Sworn enemy Hesperos 2D, and A dysfunctional love affair with a young princess Pelagia 2D, and Hot blooded 1D)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132801/#Comment_132801" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T19:39:19+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  7:39PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jerry, this sounds pretty good. I think it's an interesting improvement over the former system.<br><br>when making Godsend characters last night my group went to great lengths to tie our disadvantages into our overall story. We tend to make a big character map before we start playing, so we took the opportunity to work our disadvantages into this. As a result, all of our disadvantages are a major part of the game we'll be playing.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_132814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132814/#Comment_132814" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-05T21:05:47+00:00" title="March  5, 2008  9:05PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey man, great stuff!  <br><br>The only thing I'd personally change (if it were my game, which it totally isn't) is this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jerry D.

I'd totally not want to do the hippie thing of "Whenever it comes into play", because honestly that's not very D6. But I might say something like this:<br><br>Disadvantage chart:<br>You can use a rank 5 disadvantage - Once per session<br>You can use a rank 4 disadvantage - Once per session<br>You can use a rank 3 disadvantage - Twice per session<br>You can use a rank 2 disadvantage - Twice per session<br>You can use a rank 1 disadvantage - Three times per session<br>(then on the sheet, I might make a set of boxes indicating the number of times they could be used vs their dice payoff).<br><br>The only limitation to disad use would be the number of times that it had been used that session.<br><br>That might bring up more opportunities for lower disads to be brought up in-game.<br><br>Now, If you had a game structure set up where the game was broken down into a number of distict "acts" or something, I'd say that One Use of a Disad Per Act would be a good limiter.<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerry%20D.%20Grayson" title="Jerry D.
