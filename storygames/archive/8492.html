It's.. admirable, in a way, what they're trying to do. Deployments suck for adults, who understand what is going on, the reasons why we're doing it, and the love that is intended.. But young children just know that daddy's gone. They don't understand the vast distances or the reasons. When they talk to daddy on the phone, it's probably puzzling to them why daddy doesn't just come home. We can webcam, but doing it over a commercial net means a crappy connection and picture/sound, and the higher powered video teleconferencing systems that the army provides periodically are too infrequent. A way to make the deployment easier for the children is an admirable goal.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis just isn't the way.<br/>\n<br/>\nGotta go do something else now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_188863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/188863/#Comment_188863" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-18T00:24:41+00:00" title="January 18, 2009 12:24AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting!<br><br>It sounds sad, and a bit dangerous.<br><br><b>This bit:</b><i>We are seeking development of a tool which can be used to help families (especially, children) cope with deployments by providing a means to have simple verbal interactions with loved ones for re-assurance, support, affection, and generic discussion when phone and internet conversations are not possible.
