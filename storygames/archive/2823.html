I'm ... not convinced that the GNS definition is tremendously useful, but I do think that there is something that is in that general direction that is very important.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow here's the thing:  GNS is, fundamentally, a way of classifying people's <i>actions</i>.  It is about the moments when they choose to do something.  But there is more than <i>actions</i> to a story.  There is a huge amount of stuff that happens before and after and around and between the moments of choice.  There are moments where, in cinematic terms, things go into slow motion and you <b>hold</b> on a moment.  You do this because the audience wants to pay attention to the beauty of the moment itself, in stasis.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen a giant boulder starts rolling down on Indiana Jones, and he turns and looks up and his eyes get <i>really wide</i>, the camera holds there for a few solid seconds so that you can savor the "Oh SHIT!" moment fully.  It's not really about Indy making any choices, or any of that jazz, it's about paying a good solid few seconds of attention to the situation <i>before</i> it gets (heh) rolling.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe movie where the boulder starts rolling and Indy starts running, all without that slow-motion moment ... well, that's a <b>different movie</b>.  And, for some people, that movie might entirely miss the point.  The "point" for some people is that slow-motion moment.  If you try to figure out which <i>action</i> is most important to those people then you will inevitably miss the mark, no matter how close you come, in the same way as if you attempt to find the rational number which is exactly equal to pi.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo I've got two lines of inquiry here:  First (but probably least important) do people think I've correctly characterized a mismatch between GNS's classification scheme and some styles of play?  Second (and far more important):  What <i>tools</i> do we have to encourage people to pay attention to these moments between choices?  I <b>know</b> how to encourage people to pay attention to certain actions or choices:  I attach rules to them.  But how do I attach rules to a state of being?  I can say "When you attack with a crazed shout of fury, take +1 to your damage," and it works because people want that +1 (in order to take actions).  But somebody who is in the zen state of <i>appreciating</i> a moment ... they don't need bonusses for that.  What kind of reward (if any) can I offer that would attract their attention?  How can any mechanical benefit feed back in to help them achieve what they're looking for?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64034/#Comment_64034" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T09:40:45+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  9:40AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how it relates to action, but I know how we reward moments of high comedy or drama in most of the tabletop Amber games I've been in.<br><br>Someone shouts "QUOTE!" and the immediately preceding bit of RP gets recorded verbatim and added to the campaign webpage.

(to borrow Malcom Reynolds line). So, the player has 'succeeded' in his task to have Indiana grap the idol (replacing it with an equal quantity of sand) and has narrated his succeess... including Indiana's moment of fear and then a smug grin of success.<br><br>At that point, the GM slides a fate point forward and says "You know, it never goes smoothly...". The player gulps and, I think, you have created that moment of "oh crap".

Your example seems, to me, to be much more about the act of <i>refining</i> the state of things to make them more right (i.e. "I propose that this scene would be cooler if Indy were pursued by a rolling boulder of doom all the way out of the temple, and I offer 1 Fate Point to bribe others to think likewise").  While a cool "state of things as they are" is likely a <i>result</i> of such a process, I think that the process itself pulls people's attention away from the result.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example from play, I have played a house-ruled kung-fu game where people could dump a chip to add an elaboration to a stunt (often one not their own).  A good stunt opportunity would result in a flurry of chips and suggestions ... that did <b>not</b> draw attention to the coolness of the stunt as a whole, but rather to the process of elaboration.  People were laughing about the process of topping each other, often completely losing track of what was actually happening in the story (e.g. "... and rips the bad-guy's pants off!" followed by "... to reveal polka-dot boxers!")<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anything, that focus on the process of elaboration made it <i>harder</i> to appreciate the stunt as a whole.  I felt obliged to occasionally step out of game in order to recap ("So he jumps on the crate, somersaults onto the dim-sum cart, kicks dumplings into the waiting mouths of the mooks ..."), just so that the earlier contributions would not be lost in the puppy-pile.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64055/#Comment_64055" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T11:30:21+00:00" title="April 16, 2007 11:30AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the examples provided, I completely agree with your point concerning the player elaborations distracting from the stunt as a whole (although on a tangential note, I would argue that the distraction arises from the 'amount' and manner of contributions and not the process itself).<br><br>In my mind, though, the Fate Point process is a little bit of a different case as it never really draws attention to itself. First off the player is always free to ignore the 'compel' (by paying a Fate Point himself). Secondly ,in the example given, the player does not know WHAT he is unleashing (which I think is an intergal part of the 'oh crap' moment) only that things are about to get rough. Still, you are 100% correct that it is more about a refinement in "the rightness of things" rather than an appreciation of the way that they already are.<br><br>Assuming that the event has already happened, which seems to be a necessary assumption from where you are going, you are just looking for how to entice the character to 'react' in a convincing manner to the event, correct? Well, if that I am following you, your result might be as easy as <b>mandating</b> a 'reaction scene' any time that any big events happen... and allow your players to choose the appropriate reaction. If you don't want to make it an act of 'law', you could simply allow players to interject the reaction scenes in order to recieve some sort of passive benifit (be they fate points, drama points, xp, or what-have-you)... or if you like, let them pull a reaction scene to give them an bonus on the next sequence of actions (Indy pulls the "Oh Crap... boulder!" moment to get a +1 to running away from said boulder). Or something...<br/><br/>Now, if you want the PLAYER to go 'oh crap', that can be as simple as a subtle grin and a quick line of description. "Behind you, you hear a clink as the pedestal begins sinking into the ground. Suddenly you are struck by the way the chamber is designed... almost as if to allow something big and heavy to pass through it. Hmmm... oh well!*Smile* If I were a player, I would go "Oh crap" after hearing that!                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64059/#Comment_64059" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T12:26:56+00:00" title="April 16, 2007 12:26PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DirkGently</cite>Assuming that the event has already happened, which seems to be a necessary assumption from where you are going, you are just looking for how to entice the character to 'react' in a convincing manner to the event, correct?</blockquote>Not exactly.  Character reaction is a useful tool, but the <i>goal</i> is simply to have the players pay attention to the fact that the moment is cool and beautiful.<br/><br/>If the moment <i>isn't</i> cool and beautiful then clearly they won't pay attention to that.  However, the inverse does not hold:  If the moment is cool and beautiful, that does not imply that the players will pay attention to it.  We miss cool things.  In fact, I would say that we <b>have to</b> miss many cool things.  There's just so much potentially-cool stuff happening in a roleplaying game that a player just wouldn't have enough attention to focus on all of it.<br/><br/>I know how to focus the attention of the players on player choices.  I don't have as many techniques for focussing their attention on things that they aren't choosing at that moment ... things that (in the context of the moment) simply <i>are</i>.<br/><br/>In genre-terms, I've thought of a purer version of this than the "Oh shit" moment in <i>Raiders</i>:  In <i>Angel</i>, Joss Whedon often sets up scenes that are nothing more than the characters walking down a corridor toward the camera (and, secondarily, toward a threat they're going to face).  These scenes are completely irrelevant to the plot, total grace-notes, and entirely brilliant.  They say "Hey, audience, check these guys out!  Aren't they cool?  Let's savor.  Okay, done savoring now.  Moving on!"<br/><br/>That's the kind of thing I'm aiming at.  Not so much "How do you make characters or situation cool?" but rather "Once you've got something super-cool, how do you encourage people to take a moment to notice that, rather than going straight to the next act of creating super-cool?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64062/#Comment_64062" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T12:54:51+00:00" title="April 16, 2007 12:54PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2007 12:56PM by Vaxalon.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not just have a mechanism similar to the "QUOTE!" mechanism I mentioned previously, or "<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=570&amp;page=2#Item_19" rel="nofollow">HARDCORE!</a>" as happens in Jessica Hammer's?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64064/#Comment_64064" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T13:13:28+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  1:13PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm... yeah I think that I managed to miss your point entirely!<br/><br/>With the revised information, I think that Fred's solution is solid.

For an RPG, I would ask... how do you KNOW that the scene coming up will be cool (and worthy of appreciation)? If the scene has already passed, any 'Whoah, cool' moments seem to fall into your "recognition of the moment category" (even if they are an independent scene).\n<blockquote><br/>These scenes are completely irrelevant to the plot, total grace-notes, and entirely brilliant.

For Indy, his 'reaction scene' is a slow look around his shoulder and a terrified look on his face. For the Buffy crew, their 'reaction scene' is a scene of them being calm and impassive, even though they are going to fight the big bad and possibly die. For me, it is all about the reaction of the character's to the events (and I think that the 'reaction scene' outlined above is a reasonable start for approaching that).\n<blockquote><br/>Most of these moments are fundamentally quiet.

In your most recent example I suppose I still don't see the difference between the moment of silence that you are looking for and silence as a character reaction (although I am most likely just thick-headed!)... unless what you are arguing for is silence among the PLAYERS rather than the characters and that is a whole different kettle of fish. A moment when your players stop, completely silent, because something is so jaw droppingly cool (or important, or emotional, or whatever) is definitely something to strive for but I am fairly certain that it cannot be mandated or even encouraged through the rules. For that matter I am not even sure what type of play to encourage that would bring about such a non-action (since mechanics, as you very accurately pointed out, tend to resolve around 'actions').<br><br>With that being said, the only way I can think to even bring about such a silence is to take Fred's suggestion concerning a raised finger or hand (indicating a moment of reflection).<br><br>Looking at the dialogue above... lets assume for a moment that you have a mechanism wherin the the players are encouraged to stop and reflect when something neat happens or before making a big decision, we have to ask whether or not the players are invested enough in their character's to actually view an imposed silence as meaningful rather (and full of unspoken character development) than an arbitrary rule. Remember that this isn't a visual medium... and so we are completely dependent on speech to explain what is going on. As a player I know how I would feel about such a rule. On the other hand, if Sydney's player in the middle of a conversation answers Tony's player with dead silence.... that is powerful stuff (but mechanical inducements to answer questions with silence would definitely create a strange system).<br><br>I'll hasten to add that I am not seeing the common thread referred to in the initial post. Each example seems fairly different:<br/><br/>Example 1:<br/>Indy (which, granted, you have noted is not the best example... but on further thought, I believe is actually the strongest argument for your case)\n<blockquote><br/>When a giant boulder starts rolling down on Indiana Jones, and he turns and looks up and his eyes get really wide, the camera holds there for a few solid seconds so that you can savor the "Oh SHIT!" moment fully. <br/></blockquote>\nCharacter-wise: This seems a pretty clear example of 'emotional reaction' to an event (with the added fact that the 'reaction' lasts for a tense few seconds)<br/><br/>Player-wise: Although we can only guess at what the "players" were doing to create this scene, given that a boulder comes down and Indy reacts we have to assume that at some point they player and the GM describe those actions. Now, the best place to insert the 'silence' that you are looking for among the players would be inbetween the moment when the GM describes the rock beginning to roll and the moment when Indy's player takes action. Here is the only case where I can picture occuring naturally in play... or mandated mechanically (borrowing Fred's finger suggestion).\n<blockquote><br/>(naturally)<br/>GM: "You watch the sinking pedestal with a sense of dread. Then, behind you, you hear the grind of rock against stone as something large begins to move your way.<br/>*natural silence*<br/>Indy: Uhh... crap. *describes action*<br/></blockquote>\n<blockquote><br/>(mandated)<br/>GM: "You watch the sinking pedestal with a sense of dread. Then, behind you, you hear the grind of rock against stone as something large begins to move your way.<br/>Indy: I...<br/>*GM holds up finger, indicating silence... possibly rolling a dice to cover the dead air. Then he lowers it*<br/>Indy: Uhh... crap. *describes action*<br/></blockquote>\nThe second option, although technically feasible just feels sort of.. weird *shrug*<br/><br/>Example 2:<br/>Buffy<br/><br/>Character-wise: I'll grant that this is a weak case of reaction (although I still argue that the reaction, or lack thereof, is still intergal to why the scene comes off as cool). Rather than that, this seems a case of a 'vanity scene' wherein the characters show off how cool they are (without really doing anything).<br/><br/>Player-wise: At some point someone HAS to describe how cool the character's look. A silence imposed before the player gives the description seems arbitrary (and doesn't seem to encourage the mood that you are looking for) and a silence encouraged after the description just feels weird. Now, on the other hand, if you are looking for ways to encourage 'vanity scenes' which show off how cool a character is... there are lots of ways to do that.<br/><br/>Example 3<br/>Alias (I am guessing)<br/><br/>Character-Wise: This is a very clear case of reaction (silence is one of the strongest 'reactions' that we have in our conversational arsenal). Nevertheless, I would argue that conversational silence is a whole different phenomenon than Example 1 or Example 2.<br/><br/>Player-Wise: If the players are describing things in the third person, then I think this would sound something like "Sydney responds by saying nothing at all". The only time when we have silence among the players is if they are doing a particularly intense actual coversation (acting style) and physically respond (both player and character) with silence. This is tres cool... but... it is still a conversational reaction (and, I would argue, the clearest case of 'action' of all three).<br/><br/>Maybe if you broke an example into how you see the scene playing out among the characters and the players... your ideal example of how a RPG scene would play out? Because I think that referring to a visual medium is actually confusing the issue (as the silence that you are looking for does exist there... my problem is translating that to a tabletop environment)<br/><br/>At any rate, sorry I am a little bit slow in understanding <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64116/#Comment_64116" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T21:12:59+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  9:12PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, is it anything like what David Morgan-Mar is doing <a href="http://www.irregularwebcomic.net/1402.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>, where he has four blank black panels in his webcomic and invites his readers to take at least 10 seconds to read each panel?

By the same token, it's not an example where the player is assumed to say "My character stands silent and unmoving."  I'm actually talking about a moment that could happen when the players <i>don't say anything</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's not just <i>silence</i> I'm looking for ... silence is merely one possible vehicle, and one that I hoped would point out that this <b>cannot</b> be simply a variant on how players talk to each other.  What I'm looking for is something that comes about because the players choose to focus on what is <i>already extant in the story</i> rather than to focus upon their ability to further elaborate the story.  They turn their eyes from the next branching of the road, off in the distance, and instead look at the place they're standing, right here, right now.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou keep talking about the things the players are <i>doing</i> ... they must be describing how cool their characters are, or describing the silence, or somehow acting upon the story, changing it.

We can pay attention to those moments.  We don't have to be so insanely <i>busy</i> all the time.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou say, for instance, that we can't perceive the characters as being cool unless a player <i>describes</i> them as being cool:  We can only perceive the imaginary realm in reaction to new input.  I think that's untrue.  I think that if you say (for instance) "If you loved me, you'd stay" then we can all spend some quality time imagining the feelings that invokes in a character we know, without anyone having to tell us anything more.  That's what it means to know the character ... that there are things we can imagine without having to be told.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64118/#Comment_64118" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T21:35:12+00:00" title="April 16, 2007  9:35PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MikeRM:  It is certainly <i>something</i> like what is being done there ... but, to my mind, immensely less artsy and self-conscious.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am talking about something that you do all the time, as a member of the audience, in <i>every other medium ever invented</i>.  You have your attention directed to something by means of a pause, or spacing device, and you think about it.  You do this when you look at a painting.  You do this when you read a novel.  You <i>fer damn sure</i> do it when you read a comic book of any sort.  Every medium has structures in place to handle this ... every medium except, it sometimes seems, ours.<br/>\n<br/>\nScott McCloud, in <i>Understanding Comics</i>, talks about the transitions between panels:  how some panels transition from action to action ("Bang!  Kapow!" followed by "Aaaah!  I fall off a cliff!") and some transition from aspect to aspect of the same moment ("I love you" followed by a shot of the two teenagers as seen from above through the branches of a dying tree).  And Mr. McCloud points out (quite rightly!) that japanese comics have radically different transitions ... including many more instances of aspect to aspect.  Why?  Because they want you to slow down and pay attention to that one moment, not in terms of how it connects to the past or the future, the previous action or the next one, but just in terms of what it is, itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nSame-same.  I want the techniques to encourage people to focus their attention that way in the RPG-stories that they create.

We all paused, and while not <i>silent</i> (not that I think that you're stressing silence here, necessarily), we all had that moment of thinking, as the description played out, "Oh yeah, this is cool!" However, this moment <i>itself</i>, the reaction to it, wasn't system-driven, the system provided the <i>possibility</i> for it to happen. Maybe that's the best you can do: Create mechanics that build the possibility for cool moments.<br><br>For what it's worth, I think that Dirk has a great point about this current discussion being somewhat clouded by reference to a primarially visual medium.<br><br>Oh, and I don't think, GNS-wise, that this sort of experience has anything to do with Sim play in particular (if that's what you meant in your initial post); I think it can happen in play focused on any of the given agendas.<br><br>Aaron                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64121/#Comment_64121" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-16T22:02:51+00:00" title="April 16, 2007 10:02PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2007 10:07PM by DirkGently.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>Adam: I actually play with someone name Sydney, so it's not an Alias example, it's just my local play-group. By the same token, it's not an example where the player is assumed to say "My character stands silent and unmoving." I'm actually talking about a moment that could happen when the players<em>don't say anything</em>.</blockquote>\nHa! Sorry about that... I see Sidney and I assume Alias! Apologies <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> In any case I actually cover two cases in my example. In the first the players say "My character stands silent and unmoving" (and I understand how that runs counter to your point)... in the second though, I assume that both the players and the characters are saying nothing (as part of a very deep IC acting moment).<br><br>I am still quite certain that silence as a conversation choice IS an action (or a reaction at any rate). However, I agree that it gives players a chance to reflect on all the things that are unsaid in the conversation (which seems to meet your goals, assuming that am not misunderstanding)... but I still don't see how you could (or should) encourage or mandate such silences. Other than encouraging relationships and engaging IC dialogue, at any rate (from which a few of those meaningful silences are likely to develop).<br/><br/>Possibly the problem is that I am looking at this from a mechanical angle. Maybe the solution simply lies in explaining your intentions to the players. Saying: "Guys, I want to encourage a more contemplative environment, so rather than immediately respond to descriptions or events... consider taking a moment of silence before or after acting... not all the time. Just when you feel like it might be appropriate. Doubly, I would like to see more pauses, hesitations, and silence in conversation as well.<br/><br/>Maybe that would bring it about? Otherwise it seems to me you are trying to legislate something that 'by its definition' requires that it be spontaneous (or risk having no effect at all).\n<blockquote>But it's not just<em>silence</em>I'm looking for ... silence is merely one possible vehicle, and one that I hoped would point out that this<strong>cannot</strong>be simply a variant on how players talk to each other. What I'm looking for is something that comes about because the players choose to focus on what is<em>already extant in the story</em>rather than to focus upon their ability to further elaborate the story. They turn their eyes from the next branching of the road, off in the distance, and instead look at the place they're standing, right here, right now.</blockquote>\nAlright. This sounds like a promising idea! Other than silence can you provide an example of the sort of 'focusing on the scene at hand' that you are looking for? I would suggest encouraging players to further describe some details in the present scene rather than move forward but I am fairly certain that description would violate the "further elaborate the story" prohibition.\n<blockquote><br/>You keep talking about the things the players are<em>doing</em>... they must be describing how cool their characters are, or describing the silence, or somehow acting upon the story, changing it. I'm trying to explain that I'm talking about something different: I think that there are meaningful moments in a game that aren't about anyone doing anything at all. We can pay attention to those moments. We don't have to be so insanely<em>busy</em>all the time.<br/></blockquote>\nI do suppose that I see RPGs as being pretty much entirely about what the players are doing (in a certain, pedantic point of view, even 'silent reflection' is a concious action of the players). That may be a bias on my point.<br/><br/>But, if the players and the GM aren't doing anything, we are back to silence. I think this contemplative attitude can arise spontaneously and can be verbally encouraged (as mentioned above). I think that trying to put mechanics to it (your original question) is a recipe for disaster. In my opinion, by mandating such a thing you would destroy any value of the contemplation (and just make players impatient to move forward). Either that or your game would be filled with weird silences as players take advantage of mechanical benifits (which, in and of itself, might be an interesting experiment to see whether boredom or introspection results).\n<blockquote><br/>You say, for instance, that we can't perceive the characters as being cool unless a player<em>describes</em>them as being cool: We can only perceive the imaginary realm in reaction to new input. I think that's untrue. I think that if you say (for instance) "If you loved me, you'd stay" then we can all spend some quality time imagining the feelings that invokes in a character we know, without anyone having to tell us anything more. That's what it means to know the character ... that there are things we can imagine without having to be told.</blockquote>\nI don't think that the player has to describe the characters as being cool, but given the whole spoken media thing, to achieve your Whedon-esque camera scene... at some point, someone has to describe SOMETHING (to frame the scene if nothing else). Otherwise you have not given any sort of meaning or definition to the contemplation or observation... and there is just a weird silence (maybe someone envisions their character looking cool, another might be thinking about the girl he met at lunch, the third might be fiddling with dice... without definition no one is one the same narrative page).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, I think what you are getting at at the end sounds like a very interesting play experience (although definitely not my cup of tea). If I follow, your situation would be:<br/>Player description or dialogue<br/>Enforced silence wherin the players are encouraged to think about the ramifications and character emotions.<br/><br/>Occasionally (and if it arises spontaneously) that could lead to some deeply immersive play. To often and it just ends up slowing play and devaluing the contemplative space you are creating (most people don't do well with silences... that is part of why why mediatation is so hard).<br/><br/>Possibly I am still being slow <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Edit: Also, Aaron brilliantly stated the point that I was trying to make in about 1/10th of the space.

This <i>will not be a complete example of play</i> ... at least not in the way that we've grown accustomed to them being presented:<blockquote>Tony:  Harrick slings on his leather jacket, and straddles the motorcycle.  "Well," he says, "My job here is done."<br/><br/>Tony [thinks]:  Man ... this is how it always is with this guy, huh?  Sweep into town, clean up people's troubles, then back on the road, lonely again.  What must it be like to <i>know that</i> about yourself, to see that pattern and still go through with it?<br/>Jen [thinks]:  Wow ... he's really going to leave.  Suzie wants to go with him, but she'd never ask.  She doesn't get that he cares for her ... she still thinks of herself as the girl nobody would want to hang out with.<br/><br/><i>... Maybe some stuff is said in here, or even done.  Maybe the characters kill a zombie, or make mad passionate love.  That doesn't really matter to me ...</i><br/><br/>Tony [thinks]:  Suzie's willing to let him go.  And he knows that she's willing to let him go, and that's probably the right thing for her and for him.  And he doesn't care.  Awesome!<br/>Jen [thinks]:  This is the end of the story of Suzie's life.  Everything after this is just ... stuff that happens.  All the meaning is done, all packed into those last three days, and now it's over and she has to just live.  And it's a good ending, but sad the way all endings are sad.<br/><br/>Tony:  Harrick looks at Suzie and says gruffly, "What'cha waitin' for?  We've got miles to cover."  He tosses her his spare helmet.<br/><br/>Jen [thinks]:  Oh ... oh God.  What she must feel, right that moment, to know that the story of her life is just beginning.  I can barely imagine.<br/><br/><i>... Maybe some stuff happens.  Like, maybe players are quiet for ten minutes.  Or maybe they immediately yell out "Cool!" and one-up each other in terms of describing how Suzie reacts.  Maybe there's a nuclear dirigible.  That doesn't really matter to me ....</i></blockquote>Does that make it clear, what I'm talking about in terms of actions <i>not mattering</i> to this particular aspect?  It's not that the actions can't happen.  They can happen, or not happen, in most any combination.  Action, however, is only loosely connected to <i>perception</i>, and what I'm talking about is the way that people perceive the imagined world (and particularly, in this case, the characters) at that moment.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DirkGently</cite>Nevertheless, I think what you are getting at at the end sounds like a very interesting play experience (although definitely not my cup of tea).

Immersion, as it is clasically defined, does seem to be about slipping deep into YOUR character's role/point of view/experience... rather than grooving on and being emotionally involved with the game as a whole (including other characters and scenes). Maybe 'involvement' is a better word for what you are looking for (although ivolvementism sounds stupid <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/>)?\n<blockquote><br/>I don't see the type of perception that's going on here being necessarily limited to one character.

I think that the idea of verbalizing what you think about a scene (specifically what you like, or what emotions are going through your mind, or how you see that line or description fits into a larger scheme of motivation) might encourage players to realize that they ARE supposed to be thinking about scenes in that light. It will probably be forced at first but starting with verbalization would eventually allow your group to internalize that thought style process (possibly hitting some of the silent reflection you mentioned earlier).<br/><br/>So, to follow with the original question of the thread, here is a sketch of a mechanic that might start approaching what you are going for (feel free to let me know if it misses the point or is too complicated).\n<blockquote><br/>Groovin' Scenes:<br/><br/>Every player is assigned a different type or color of token. The GM gets assigned a set as well. The big mass of these are put into the center of the table.<br/><br/>At any point in the game, players (or the gamemaster) can, and are encouraged to, indicate that before the scene moves forward that they want to "groove" on the elements that are already established. They indicate this by raising a finger or some other mutually agreed upon expression (it should probably be non-verbal and non-agressive in nature).<br/><br/>Once the indication is acknowledged, the player contributes by describing what he imagines the character is experiencing, what emotions this causes for him (as a player), something he thought was particularly evocative in a description, or anything else that comments on an already established element without trying to elaborate or add something new (although a little elaboration is probably not a terrible thing).<br/><br/>If he is 'groovin' on his own character or a situation that he created, he takes one of the tokens assigned to him from the center of the pile.<br/><br/>If he is 'groovin' on another character or another character's situation (including GM created stuff) he takes one of their tokens from the pile.<br/><br/>What do the tokens do?<br/><br/>Well, a player can spend one of his tokens to affect some level of narrative change in the scene being developed. In theory this should be done to bring the scene more in line with the sort of emotions or motivations that he is groovin' on for his character.<br/><br/>Alternately, rather than drawing a token after a 'groovin' sequence, he can spend one instead and recieve a passive mechanical bonus to an appropriate skill (essentially being rewarded for elaborating on his character).<br/><br/>A player can spend the tokens of another player exactly like his own tokens, but, in addition, he can 'call in a favor' and give the token to the appropriate player. The accepting player should then take the time to 'groove' on the current situation, focusing on the actions of the character who 'called in the favor' (this could take the form of the accepting player describing the emotions going through HIS character becauase of the actions of the first character). This should also give a passive mechanical bonus to BOTH players as well.<br/></blockquote>\nHow far off am I from what you are looking for? Cold? Warm?

An industrialist he approached asked "But if there are no wires ... where do we put the meters?"  On one level it's an inane quesiton ... the whole point of broadcast power is to break apart that kind of hierarchical network.  But, on the more informed level, it's a brilliant question:  The hierarchy and meters are what fund the power stations.  If you've got a system where nobody has any incentive to do the things that keep the system running then how does it keep going?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have the same problem here:  I'd like to offer some reward for paying attention to cool stuff.  The reward would help to draw people's attention to that, and to encourage them to think of ways to see the world in that way.  But if all they want to do is to groove on stuff then there's nothing that they <i>need</i> that you can reward them with.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm taking a careful look at the rewards you're offering here, and contemplating them.

Here goes:<br><br>I played in a sorcerer game which was set in high school. Specifically, a suburban school that wasn't too terribly big. My dude was a film student whose lawyer daddy had forced him onto the track team. "Don't make it to provincials* and I'll never pay your art school tuition". Also, he was gay and had recently broke it off with his girlfriend and explained that factor to her. She was out for revenge and felt wounded.<br><br>*State finals being the equivalent, maybe?<br><br>I tried this particular type of roleplaying which was highly immersed, highly dialogue-focused, and rarely pausing.<br/>I've got two scenes I'd like to share:<br/><br/>In the previous session, he'd broken a teammate's leg. I suggested there was a confrontation scene with his coach.\n<blockquote><br/>Me: <i>Jordan is running around the gym, doing laps. He's been running for an hour. Here's the point where his coach enters, right?</i><br/>JB (the GM): <i>The coach enters, and walks into the centre of the room. He waits for Jordan to stop. </i> Jordan, I've... I've been meaning to talk to you.<br/>Me: (I pause for two seconds. Just really quickly.) <i>Jordan doesn't stop. He keeps running.</i> Oh.<br/>JB: <i>The coach is fairly stunned. He feels challenged here, like his power is being usurped but he can't quite pinpoint it.</i> I heard that Thom is in hte hospital with a broken leg.<br/>Me: Yeah, that sounds accurate.<br/>JB: <i>He talks more assertively now, and stamps his foot expecting you to stop running.</i> I heard you broke it.<br/>Me: <i>Jordan pants harder now, just for show.</i> Yeah, that sounds accurate.<br/>JB: Do you realize what your job as a team mate is?<br/>Me: Ensure that no team mate feels left out or cast aside?<br/>JB: (pause. acts out a dumbfound coach struggling to react.) Yes.<br/>Me: And learn to seperate personal life from athletic pursuits?<br/>JB: (hesitant) Yes.<br/>Me: And not take out our emotional frustrations on fellow teammates...<br/>JB: Jordan, I -<br/>Me: (interrupting) ...and not to forget that being a team means being a team. <br/><br/>(Okay, I'm just going to cut to the end of the scene.)<br/><br/>JB: I need you to realize that I have certain lines that cannot be crossed, Jordan. I think you're a good athlete, but...<br/>Me: (interrupts JB) <i>Okay, one second. I need a pause here.</i> (I take some time to think here, because my reaction will likely close this scene and I want it to be good.) <i>Okay, Jordan stops running at this point, panting a little bit, and turns to his coach. </i>  I think we're both saying the same thing here, sir.<br/></blockquote>\nOkay, so in case you can't catch it... the scene was rife with parodying the coach, and (pardon the pun!) running circles around him, and just proving a point: I am spiteful, and my thorns are out.<br/><br/>I never stated Jordan's intent, or what was going on in his head. This scene was about wearing a mask and being tough enough to hold up to an external source of criticism (which was really hitting his conscience).<br/><br/> By letting my actions speak for themselves, it meant that both me and everyone else at the table had to read into things - had to try and figure out exactly who he was accusing of what, and exactly what was pushing this shy film kid into being a cold aggressor (aside from his freakin' demon.)<br/><br/>This ties into the appreciation for what is, and the ramification thing that you're talking about Tony. I didn't feel it necessary to say, at any point, "Oh, maybe I could have him be spiteful towards his coach! Oh, guys, what about if he just kept running?" I didn't explain at any point, "The reason he says this is because his girlfriend situation has informed him that honesty just wounds everyone." I just lived it, and found even myself reading into the words coming out of my mouth. Living the situation, and allowing the ramifications to sink in about exactly what that said about the character, was a process that seemed to feel more human than overnarrating everything.<br/><br/>Also, there was the pause. I forced everyone to stop and wait, because I knew Jordan would want to interrupt and I wanted it to be golden. I forced a pause in order to (a.) let the situation really sink in, and (b.) figure out the most savage thing I could say at that point.  I did this again, in another scene...<br/><br/>His ex approached him in the halls, a few weeks after he told her that he was gay and broke it off with her:\n<blockquote><br/>JB (as the ex): Listen, you know Kyle? in Theatre?<br/>Me: <i> Stone faced, no response. </i><br/>JB: Well, we've been talking a lot, but I think he might be gay.<br/>Me: <i> no response. </i><br/>JB: Like, maybe. But I've been talking to him a lot. and so I want you to find out.<br/><br/>(I'm just going to skip to the end here)<br/><br/>JB: So, do you think he is?<br/>Me: (pause) <i> Guys, just give me a second to think here.</i><br/>Kirk: Hey, you could have him -<br/>Me: (interrupting belligerantly) <i> No, give me a second.... Oh, okay. So, he closes his locker door really delicately, locks it, slides his messenger bag over his shoulder.</i> (puts on a face of disgust) I don't know, Amy. Have you dated him yet? </blockquote>\nFucking brought down the house. I don't know if this translates well, but it was met with applause and high fives.<br/><br/>The points being two-fold: I let the ramifications of the dialogue register on their own, and I didn't try to make sure everyone saw the same things I did. Secondly, I actually halted the scene, again... partially to appreciate it and partially to figure it out better.<br/><br/>I think both those behaviours are similar to what you're talking about, as they turn player attentions towards what exists, and towards piecing all that together... instead of trying to offer the next cool thing. I kept the scenes solitary, didn't invite collaboration, and kept them dialogue-focused in this game as an attempt to achieve this exact thing you're talking about.<br/><br/>Am I on track?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently" title="DirkGently"><img alt="DirkGently" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DirkGently">DirkGently</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64255/#Comment_64255" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T07:16:25+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  7:16AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2007 7:21AM by DirkGently.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sempiternity</cite>I'm not sure if Adam says this or not, it's a bit confusing (sorry Adam!), but you could have the tokens you take or are given for grooving feed directly into the "normal" action-oriented economy - some form of Artha, Fate Points, etc.</blockquote>\nSorry for the confusion... I do the best that I can but my rules language is always pretty dense (it is a failing!).<br/><br/>Honestly, assuming that the game has some sort of normal economy (Artha, Drama Points, Fate Points, Willpower, what-have-you) a system like this could... and probably should... be patched into it. When I wrote the sketch, I was trying to making it 'system independent', so I did not assume that such an economy existed.\n<blockquote>(Edit: oh, wait - that doesn't really help, does it? The problem is how you use a "reflect moment" to pick up a token to begin with... being given one for reflecting is different from taking one for being reflected, having a limited supply (gift dice) is different from an unlimited one, etc...)</blockquote>\nWell, I think with a few tweaks, it would be easy enough to adjust. To keep from ruining the in-game economy, you would want to limit the amount available and start with only a few tokens in the center (this would make it much more important to 'reflect' on other people rather than just yourself).<br/><br/>For an alternate means of doing it, you could simply hand each player a number of tokens at the beginning of the game and allow them to use as gift dice when other players 'reflect' on issues concerning your character. <br/><br/>And the simplest means (and by no means wrong) would be simply to give a point of 'in game resource' every time a player engages in a 'good' reflection scene. Again, the GM could limit the maximum amount given out to keep from runing the balance of a game economy. Is this closer to what you were thinking?<br/><br/>At any rate, the rules sketch was not meant to be the end-all and be-all of encouraging in game reflection. I just put it out there to give some mechanical/rpg based grounding and hopefully spur further discussion to help Tony out in his quest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_64256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64256/#Comment_64256" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-18T07:22:37+00:00" title="April 18, 2007  7:22AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2007 7:23AM by TonyLB.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe:  You're on track.

I use a token to get a pause, implicitly promising that what I come up with will be entertaining.  I live up to that promise.  Value:  Pretty damn good.<br/>\n2. I use a token to get a pause, implicitly promising that what I come up with will be entertaining.  I give it my best try, but fail to entertain.  Value:  Even better (to quote <i>Meet the Robinsons</i>:  "From failure, you <b>learn</b>.  From success?  Not so much.")<br/>\n3. I use a token to get a pause, but do not implicitly promise cool stuff as a consequence, and indeed don't try to do anything cool.

It's predicated on the old saw that if they really understood how useful focussed rules would be they'd stop wanting them out of the way.<br><br>That canard is behind a huge volume of the miscommunication between those of us who like rules to fade away and those who like them up front and supporting the action.  I don't make the mistake of thinking you only like supportive rules because you haven't played the right system where they fade away, don't make the equivalent mistake back.<br><br>I'm one of the fade away crowd, it has occurred to me that there could be rules to help, but on thinking it through I think that fundamentally misses why I enjoy roleplaying and for guys like me this is an impossible thing before breakfast to utterly misuse that phrase.  Having rules focussing on stuff is not fun for me, that's not because I've not found the right rules yet, it's because I have a different play preference.<br><br>When we get that people have preferences we do not ourselves understand, we can start talking, but you're really here falling into that trap of thinking that fade away gamers just haven't found the right rules yet.<br><br>I don't like rules to get out of the way because I'm looking for some other thing, I'm an adult, I like rules to get out of the way because I have more fun that way and because I find the rules ultimately to be boring and want them in play as little as feasible without going freeform which then creates new problems.  Many games cater to that desire for me, the whole point of the indie gaming revolution in part is that guys like me are so well catered to and always have been and guys like you were getting ignored.  <br><br>People having fun gaming don't need saving.  Don't fall into that trap.  There is no ruleset out there which by focussing on different things will ever win the rules getting out of the way crowd, because it is inherently contradictory to support rules getting out of the way with rules that intrude at interesting points in the game.<br/><br/>Fruitful void dude, fruitful void.

It's more like a business decision.  It's not personal, it's the outcome of somebody calculating the best return they can get on their investment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a for-instance, in <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, you keep the dice that you've rolled in a separate "spent" pile.  You can't use those dice again, but you <b>can</b> give them to other people in the form of "Opinions."  Like, I can say (in character) "Wow, you are one cold-hearted bitch" and slide three dice across the table to the person playing the character I'm slamming.  Then, later, if they have their character act like a cold-hearted bitch they get to add those dice to their rolls.  When the dice have been used once, they come back to me.<br/>\n<br/>\nForming opinions is the only way that you can get your dice back.  But, because of the flow of dice, it's not possible to give huge numbers of opinions to <i>every</i> player.  You have to give some, but you're motivated to give to the people who are likely to go with your suggestions.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf I'm playing, and people aren't giving me Opinions, I don't feel like they're insulting my play.  What I feel is that they're finding better places to invest their dice ... because other characters are striking them more forcefully.  I'm pretty well okay with hearing the relative statement, "You're doing well, but Jen is doing even better."  It's much easier for me to hear than the absolute statement "Your play is not good enough for me to reward."<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment, that's what I'm trying to work into this system.  Still thinking, unfortunately.

It is about the moments when they choose to do something.  But there is more than<em>actions</em>to a story.  There is a huge amount of stuff that happens before and after and around and between the moments of choice.  There are moments where, in cinematic terms, things go into slow motion and you<strong>hold</strong>on a moment.  You do this because the audience wants to pay attention to the beauty of the moment itself, in stasis.<br><br>When a giant boulder starts rolling down on Indiana Jones, and he turns and looks up and his eyes get<em>really wide</em>, the camera holds there for a few solid seconds so that you can savor the "Oh SHIT!" moment fully. <br>.....<br/>The movie where the boulder starts rolling and Indy starts running, all without that slow-motion moment ... well, that's a<strong>different movie</strong>. <br/>....<br/>So I've got two lines of inquiry here:  First (but probably least important) do people think I've correctly characterized a mismatch between GNS's classification scheme and some styles of play?  </br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nHI Tony,<br/><br/>GNS is indeed a way of classifying people's<em>actions</em>. The player's actions. The moments you're talking about are not player actions, they are moments <em>within</em> the fiction. <br/><br/>Later, you make clear you mean the player's actions of focussing on those "slow motion moments." That just paraphrases Ron's description of the simulationist agenda -- to savor moments -- AKA -- to recreate an ideal. <br/><br/>So, no, there's no mismatch, though I think the creation of slow motion moments is really useful concept for describing sim play -- one of several symptoms as it were.<br/><br/>Oh, and to be further contrary -- there is no actual slow motion in Raiders of the Lost Ark -- that's just your perception of clever intercutting. You and I did see a different movie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_64367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/64367/#Comment_64367" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-19T06:46:17+00:00" title="April 19, 2007  6:46AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alan:  We could get into a semantic discussion of whether "focussing your attention" is an action, but let me offer that I have <b>never</b> heard an argument that such an internal state could be a factor in GNS discussions.  So if it's an action then it is a different kind than GNS works with.  GNS (to my limited, but still fairly extensive) understanding rests upon an analysis of the external, observable actions that players take, not the internal, wholly subjective ones.<br/>\n<br/>\nPeople talking about Sim (starting with Ron, and moving forward) <i>do not</i> talk about how players <i>savor</i> a moment.  They talk about the priorities that players give to certain functions of exploration ... of how they <i>create</i> the moment, and how they prioritize that act of creation.  They talk about how internal causality plays a part, and how players try to map mechanics to in-game physics, and that sort of thing.  They talk, in short, about external, observable actions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, that's how I've always seen it.  I can't really say more than that, because everything I say in the "He said this" mode is colored by my own perception of the conversation.  I could easily just have been misreading all these years.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, yeah, there's no slow-motion in <i>Raiders</i>, but there is a long hold on Indy's face.  Longer, I'm pretty sure, than it would take for the boulder to roll over him and squash him like a pancake.  It's like the two minute soliloquy that happens between when the bomb is at 00:38 and when it reaches 00:05 ... it's playing fast and loose with the presentation of time.  I was sloppy in my terminology, but I think the overall point still stands.  But then, I would, wouldn't I?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Slow-motion moments - Page

There is an intercutting of shots that, if added together, are far longer than it would take for the boulder to squash Indie. That's an editing technique that the editor has learned produces a fairly consistent subjective experience in individual viewers. That's actually a good analogy for RPG system -- particular sets of rules can produce a fairly consistent outcomes. <br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers also learn that certain actions produce certain outcomes and tend to select those that produce the outcome they like best. So in that sense they learn to focus their outcomes.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut you know, I wonder if you aren't right -- these slow motion moments may be outside creative agenda. I mean, when I'm playing Sorcerer and a player's guy makes a cool choice about tricking his girlfriend into feeding his demon that might well be a "slow motion moment" that only has cool because of the narrativist context. Or likewise, when I throw my D&amp;D3.5 Fighter into the fray with 10 hit points and pull off a cool Feat combo, we might have a slo mo gamist moment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if these moments you're talking about aren't moments of group reward, specific to the prefered agenda?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65075/#Comment_65075" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T14:20:32+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  2:20PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry I didn't respond sooner. This is a cool thread. I've been Rip Van Winkle lately.<br/><br/>I agree with Aaron that I don't think the techniques you're discussing have much to do with Simulationism or, more broadly, GNS. Techniques are just techniques and they're useful for all sorts of play.  If you did want to talk about Sim and rules for supporting Sim play, I'm happy to talk more about what I think I understand. <img alt="=)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title="=)"/><br/><br/>I disagree with Alan that these things are outside Big Model. Creative Agenda is basically what things you want to explore in the fiction to get your groove on. If your mental state is grooving on the slo-mo moment of the boulder about to crush Indy, that seems like a CA thing. So what-grooves-you is connected to CA because everything about play touches the "spear" of CA but the finger that points to the moon is not the moon. Those groovy moments are ephemera. The slo-mo thing or any other game design thing to get you to groove more is a technique. So let's talk techniques!<br/><br/><br/>The "slow motion" movie effect that you discuss has its counterpart in RPGs: rolling dice. I'll even argue that any point of contact with the rules is, in essence, the game designer's way of "forcing" the players to slow down and savor the moment.\n<blockquote><br/>DM: The dragon swoops down and rakes his giant claw across your shoulder. *rolls dice* A narrow miss! The claw rips across your gorget, perforating it with a jagged scratch!<br/></blockquote>\nRolling dice comes with a dramatic pause, for free.\n<blockquote><br/>GM: What does Indy do?<br/>Player: I eyeball the statue to guess its weight and replace the idol with the sand bag.<br/>GM: You swap the bag and the idol. For a moment, everything is quiet but then a fifteen foot high bolder comes rolling out of the wall toward you!<br/>Player: Oh shit! I run!<br/>GM: Make a Tough roll to escape!<br/>Player: *rolls dice breathlessly*<br/></blockquote>\nThe more times you make Indy's player roll, the more "slo-mo" the scene. Chase scene mechanics in RPGs can resolve the chase in a single roll or it can make it a cat-and-mouse game with more rolls and more points of contact. The tense combat between you and the dragon can be resolved in a single roll or the rules can have you rolling and rolling. D&amp;D combat is very slo-mo but is it tense? Is it worth savoring?<br/><br/>I don't understand why you need to reward people for appreciating the moment. I think you might want to create mechanics that facilitate a player's appreciation of those moments and, as you've said, you just attach rules to things to do that. Why do you think you need to attach rules to a state of being? To what end?<br/><br/>I think you're asking: How do you make people stop and realize how cool their gaming moments are? Right?<br/><br/>If so, perhaps you build a Reflect step into IIEE. I think rules like <i>PtA</i>'s Fan Mail encourage continuous reflection about the "coolness" of the game actions but those rules don't require it. The <i>awarding</i> of fan mail that is the reflection you want, but the evaluation leading up to a fan mail award is. I get the feeling that you think that the outward expressions of "hey, this is cool" can disrupt the actual coolness of those moments. Maybe this can be fixed with some procedure. Instead of awarding fan mail as instant gratification, each player makes brief notes and can award it at the end of a scene and explain what was so cool.<br/><br/>Or maybe you need an inner-thoughts mechanic to capture your "oh shit" Indiana Jones moment. <i>Require</i> players to describe how their characters react via descriptions of facial expressions or inner dialogue.\n<blockquote><br/>GM: You swap the bag and the idol. For a moment, everything is quiet but then a fifteen foot high bolder comes rolling out of the wall toward you!<br/>Player: My eyes bug out! "Oh shit!" I'm thinking. Then I start running!<br/></blockquote>\nIn your "If you really love me then you wouldn't be ashamed to say so!" example, those &gt;dead silence&lt; moments could be left silent or they could be filled with player dialog expressing what was going through their heads. I think you can codify that with game procedure. If that's what you want.<br/><br/>I have a slight problem with your film and comics analogies because those are generally activities that are not shared with other people. You read a comic alone. You watch a movie alone, even if you're sitting next to your family. If something is so cool in a movie that you speak out about it, you could very well do the same thing in an RPG. Any parallel to extra comic frames or slow motion will require, in an RPG, to have people talking because <i>talking is how stuff gets into the fiction</i>. Well, and sometimes writing+reading.<br/><br/>So here's a possible solution that uses talking. You describe something in the game. I think it's a really, really cool moment. To show that, the rules encourage me to add a detail to the scene or rephrase it from another perspective, perhaps my character's. It's a forced redundancy that says to everyone at the table, "I am grooving on this, and this is how I see it."\n<blockquote><br/>GM: You swap the bag and the idol. For a moment, everything is quiet but then a fifteen foot high bolder comes rolling out of the wall toward you!<br/>Player who thinks this is AWESOME: Yeah. I plop the bag onto the pedestal and turn around arrogantly, walking away. Then I hear stone grinding against stone and turn around to see a billion tons of granite threatening to crush me. My eyes bug out! "Oh shit!" I'm thinking. Then I start running!<br/></blockquote>\nI love the "be quiet for a minute" mechanic. I recall someone's game having a "soliloquy" rule. I've toyed with "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_stick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">talking stick</a>" mechanics. Perhaps you always slide N beads forward, where N equals the number of players not counting you. Each player may slide one bead back. So you can get all your beads back if everyone thinks your moment was cool.<br/><br/>Or, maybe tie all this into the reward system. This is how your characters grow, during cool moments. You gamble that your moment is cool. If people agree, you get <i>trait points</i> back, not blue beads. The trait you write has to pertain to your cool moment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65323/#Comment_65323" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-25T12:09:57+00:00" title="April 25, 2007 12:09PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I agree with Aaron that I don't think the techniques you're discussing have much to do with Simulationism or, more broadly, GNS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I disagree with Alan that these things are outside Big Model.</blockquote>\nCorrection: I must have been on crack when I wrote that post.
