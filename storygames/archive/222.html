                    OK, so I'd like to start a new discussion from Sydney Freedberg's comments -- which ties together several people's comments on the recent Setting material thread: <br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=159#Item_19" rel="nofollow"> "CHARGEN" IS THE ENEMY OF STORY"</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=175&amp;page=1#Item_20" rel="nofollow">"I like games where..."</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=211&amp;page=1#Item_26" rel="nofollow">"Setting Material and the Three Bears"</a><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=196&amp;page=1#Item_49" rel="nofollow">"On the Abolition of Character Generation"</a><br/><br/>So the gist of Sydney's comment is: <br/><i>I am saying "too much GOOD setting/chargen/prep gets in the way, precisely because it's so good you have trouble letting go of it and being open to the far cooler thing you will produce in play."</i><br/><br/>Now, I don't find this to be true in my own actual play.  In particular, many of my games are set in the real world (historical or modern) or close variant thereof, which is more detailed than any fantasy setting.  If I have a cool detailed setting and detailed characters, I find it produces <i>even more</i> cool things which they do in the setting.  This might have something to do with different approaches to the game and creation.  <br/><br/>I can go on about this, but I'd first like to establish the topic.  Thoughts on this?                </div>

                            Being able to take established facts about a setting and weave them together into a situation is often cited as a "GM Skill," and it certainly does require some skill and can be both enjoyable to do and enjoyable to play in. <br/>
<br/>
It is not, however, necessary, which is what I think Sydney's getting at.  You can create a situation from the setting, or you can create a setting from the situation, either way.  It boils down to whether you want to weave together established details or create them on your own, and I suspect that this is just a personal preference.                        </div>

                            I think all things in moderation. There is a point at which something comes from such an alien point of view to the "assumed" stance of a particular person, that they may need more material to convey playing in that environment (whether its a world, a room, a single scene that needs certian framing.) <br/>
<br/>
It goes back to the old concept: you can goto a room and ask ten people to draw a tree. While all will likely draw a tree, they will all draw different trees. (this presumes of course language not being a barrier and willingness and other things..)  Each tree is different. That is OK if all you want is Trees.<br/>
<br/>
The idea however is that each person's frame of reference is different enough, that when they come to a particular sort of game session/environment--they will see things differently. When you want something more consistent in outlook (everyone to draw trees found in a deciduous  forest) you may have to establish limits--details. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
More detail detracts from their personal frame, but it brings everyone closer to a common shared frame. Depending on your purpose--either method can have issues.<br/>
<br/>
I come from a background of gaming where I know that not every person who sits at the table with me is going to offer the same beneficial amount of output as any other--and WHO that person may be may change from play session to play session. So sometimes the common frame works better to smooth over these synergy issues.                        </div>

                            I don't think that's it, Troy.  Somebody who's interested in exploring a setting could just as easily play Conquer the Horizon (which is all about creating that setting as you explore it) as something with tons and tons of books to detail the setting.<br/>
<br/>
Taking established information and weaving it into an aesthetically pleasing shape is different than creating new information in an aesthetically pleasing shape.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could call it a difference in technical agenda, but... meh.                        </div>

                            I'd disagree with Sydney's wording of the idea that it is good setting and character background info that will get in the way of fun gaming.<br/>
<br/>
Good setting and character background info is set to be dynamic and change and create opportunties for adventure and conflict for the entire table.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is bad character background and setting info that is a frustrated cry from the player or the GM who has begun to play before they hit the table due to being let down by table play in the past.<br/>
<br/>
This doesn't mean that setting and characer info = bad and a lack thereof = good.  This means that t he background info has to be a metaphorical boulder rolled up to the top of a hill, ready to dynamically roll down in some wonderful direction to be determined through play rather than a boulder rolled to a pretty spot that should never move lest its beauty be tarnished.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make sense?                        </div>

                            Every established factof the setting creates certain opportunities for play, but closes off other ones.  If we establish that all dwarves are male (a simple biological fact), then we have closed off the opportunity for playing female dwarves, but at the same time raised some other issues of dwarf gender and how they relate to other races.  The simple statement "this is a fantasy world" limits a player's ability to introduce science fiction elements into play, or vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
The setting is there as fuel for ideas and play.  Some GMs and players need or like a lot of detail, so they have a lot of potential situations, conflicts and characters.  But having a detailed setting is also restricting.  Some prefer fewer restrictions and more potential to define things within a loose framework.<br/>
<br/>
I think these are simply different approaches to gaming, and neither "detailed setting are good" nor "detailed settings are bad" can be taken as objective truth.  They're style things that sit with some people better than others.                        </div>

                            I play a lot of games with occult or esoteric features; magic is real, or spies are out there doing... spy things, or the universe is actually anthropomorphic in nature.  These are things that some people know and others don't, and just because you discover 'a' truth doesn't mean it's 'the' truth.<br/>
<br/>
Layers are good, because they allow for a certain (sometimes vast) amount of known setting material that can, even though it's known, be tinkered with to accomodate the story/game.  That may sound like eating your cake and having it, too, but, well, it is, actually.                        </div>

                            I don't think good setting gets in the way of things in any kind of axiomatic fashion. That's like saying "GOOD rules get in the way of things because they limit possibilities for BETTER outcomes." <br/>
<br/>
That *could* be true for some people ... but it isn't axiomatic by any stretch. And the thing about 'exploring setting' as an agenda just goes to show how the all-too-common methodology of "assigning agenda" by one poster to another is an incredibly poor way to judge or discuss anything.<br/>

                            As much as I love creating the setting (and usually enjoy the ones I create better then ones provided for me), I love subverting it even better. "You think it's like this, <i>but it's actually not</i>".<br/><br/>And, unfortunately, you can't subvert what's not there. This means that if I'm starting from scratch, I have to put in the time and effort to establish "truth" with the other players, just so I can turn it on it's head. If said "truth" can be provided for all of us in advance this saves me a lot of effort.<br/><br/>Let's try this on for size - "Just enough setting so that I can do whatever I want around it".                        </div>

Part of it is that, really, you <i>have</i> to go back a few thousand years to get at the roots of stuff.

That way you avoid useless work, and you can wind up surprising yourself by introducing contradictions and the like.<br/><br/>Just from that passage alone, you can get:<br/><br/>* What's a travelcaptain?<br/>* Who are 'his people', and why is that custom important?<br/>* What about the badges?<br/>* Why is 'Apostate' a good thing?<br/>* What's a landbeast, why does it need a captain, and how the hell do you <i>board</i> one?

                            I'm going to (surprise) agree with Josh. A lot of the issue is not one of absolutes, its one of thresholds. <br/><br/>Tell me to make something up, just out of the air, and I'll sit there and stutter. Tell me, otoh, that you want me to make a character in a pseudo-Persian setting and I'll be able to come up with something. Give me a slender volume on the pseudo-Persian setting that introduces some cool ideas and a small handful of solid facts and I'll be able to come up with something that kicks you in the face. Give me 5 books about the setting, full of fine details of rank and etiquette and detailed diagrams and legion lists and I'll sit there with that blank look on my face. <br/><br/>Everyone will find a different place where they're comfortable, and that seems pretty common sense and normal. I think the only reason that it isn't is because we've seen such a historic emphasis on heavy setting in the hobby -- Plotus and Wilderlands of High Fantasy must rock because they are 600 pages long, right? And when Midnight was going to end after only 3 books, everyone got upset because there needed to be so much more material. So sometimes, in recovering from that, we have a tendency to overbalance the other way. <br/><br/>For me, I like games who have enough detail to do what the game should do. <br/><br/>Isn't that vague and unhelpful? <br/><br/>Let me give some examples then. I liked Exalted when it was the main book and maybe Scavenger Sons. There was this huge, dynamic world sketched in broad strokes that was perfect for these hugely iconic video-game and anime-esque characters to knock the stuffing out of in epic wars on vaguely defined battlefields that gained their character through PC stunts. I liked it less once there were 35 books full of setting with specific details about how the economics of creation worked and where you could and could not do things that may or may not be cool. <br/><br/>I like Polaris with just the main book, even though it's got even less information than Exalted, because Polaris is a fairy-tale of the fall. It gives you the tone and the vague outlines of the world that are all a fairy-tale should have. There is long long ago, and far far away, and ice and tragedy, and that is enough because that is what the story is built of. <br/><br/>I like Ex Machinca because it has several different settings, all fairly unique, all built around a strong central vision. The detail and material of those settings works to advance that central vision in order to build up a strong sense of coherency, place, and tone without swamping in details or meaningless drivel. <br/><br/>I like Glorantha as presented in the HeroQuest main book, a dynamic world with these vague and shifting boundaries. I don't like Glorantha as it becomes on many of the mailing lists, a place of endless debate over which Godlearner citadel is now under which island and which ruler of the Lunars was the one who fought this other guy that you'll only have heard of if you bought the limited print magazine only available at this con that happened 20 years ago in Kerala.<br/><br/>I liked Tribe 8 with the MRB and the Vimary setting book. It was a highly thematic treatment of a limited location that gave enough detail to understand social structure without being concerned with things like floorplans or specific hierarchical charts. It gave you a world and a feeling for that world. I liked Tribe 8 less as more and more information got added to that, and we got lists of clans and what they did and who they rules and where their lines of power were. It moved the game away from a focus on rebellion, spiritual redemption, and grail-questing and towardsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ something else. <br/><br/>For every game, and every person, the sweet spot is going to be a little different.                        </div>

Can you give any examples of what kind of world-building you like, and which you consider a mistake?  Your example reminds me of the sort of material that I tend to skip over in reading a setting.  I'll maybe glance at one or two sentences like that, but to me they're mostly pointless.  There's no way that I can memorize the exact text, and it has no defined meaning that I can remember and use in play.  <br/><br/>If the setting gives me sensible information which I can visualize and understand, then I can remember it and extend from it.  So "Greenhaven is a thriving town of 5000 which is in the hilly country at the upper end of the Bright River which runs through the country of Queensland."  That makes sense to me.  Particularly if there's a map showing the country and river, I can form a picture in my head of it and I can make up my own cool characters and places in the town during play.  In contrast, suppose I read "Greenhaven is officially an tertiary district of Dellslandau, whose abnormally high production of copperbrew in recent years has troubled the District Administrator."  I'll tend to simply ignore that and it's unlikely to come up in play.                        </div>

<p>Man, I should put this in Bruce's thread about gamers who do things that you just cannot grok. If a text tells me something that's not directly in terms of people, like, "Lionsbreath Falls is thirty miles from the city of Pankinagar," I'll immediately forget it. But "Lionsbreath Falls is so famously beautiful that a war is fought over it at least once a century," is cool and useful to me.</p>

                            I'm in agreement with Shreyas. And I'm thinking that it's due to one statement being flat and non-active, and the other being a dynamic statement of situation. It alludes to the world being acitve and in motion, as opposed to a bunch of dots on a map.<br/>

                            First: Wow, and thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a bit staggered that THE John Kim is taking the time to tell me where I'm wrong -- I rather feel as if I'm about to graduate from something and am now defending my thesis before a senior professor. And fortunately, unlike in an actual thesis defense, I'm free to keep restating my thesis until I make it clear enough that people get it.<br/>
<br/>
So:<br/>
<br/>
"Detail = bad?" No. Of course not. And I never said that, although I can see why reasonable people got that impression.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, "good setting and character background info...get in the way of fun gaming"? No, and, again, actually, that's not quite what I said: I was talking about "too much" of  a good thing -- although "too much" is vague to the point of meaninglessness, so I'll try to make that clearer in this post.<br/>
<br/>
But "the kind of setting information I ...gives plentiful flavor without significantly limiting ...options" -- there, I think, Jack Aidley's nailed it.<br/>
<br/>
Specific example time:<br/>
<br/>
I strongly, strongly recommend that everyone click over to this Forge thread (http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=12424.0) where someone is absolutely struggling with the fact that he and his group want to start a  game, because they love  -- but they wanted to do things that aren't compatible with canon, and they were stuck. And it's not the crappy "extended universe" stuff that various licensees added to the setting that was the problem, either. It was the  movies, the very thing they loved  for in the first place ("too much of a good thing," remember). They wanted to play powerful characters who changed the fate of the Galaxy -- but Lucas's characters in the original movies : How could they be the heroes without contradicting canon? <br/>
<br/>
So they were faced with a dilemma between dialing down their characters to be lesser heroes -- in other words, de-protagonizing  before play even  -- or setting their adventures in some time or place so far removed from the original films that there was no possibility of interaction -- in other words, abandoning the heart of the setting, the very things they loved about it, and marginalizing themselves.<br/>
<br/>
What I (and others) suggested: . Take out the parts that get in the way -- the specific identities and actions of established characters -- and put in what you want: make the characters that  invent be the heroes who blow up the Death Star(s), have a father / mother / mentor who's gone to the Dark Side, struggle to build the aggressive power to overthrow the Emperor without becoming as corrupted by power and aggression as he is.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if that group ever followed this advice or not. But think about it: The very coolness that attracted them to the setting in the first place got in the way of making it their own and creating their  coolness.<br/>
<br/>
Now - extended metaphor time:<br/>
<br/>
Imagine that, instead of roleplaying, we're building Tinkertoys. (Or Legos, or Erector Sets; whatever, as long as it's got physical structure and can be extended). Imagine, moreover, that while we  just build our own structures from stratch out of raw, unassembled components, we also have hundreds and hundreds of other peoples' pre-existing Tinkertoys to play with -- to play with AND MODIFY, clicking in new pieces and taking out existing elements to get the design that's ideal for us personally.<br/>
<br/>
(Bear with me, people).<br/>
<br/>
Now, some of these existing structures are huge: They have lots and lots of materials. (Thick setting sourcebooks, complicated character generation, whatever). Some of them are tiny, with only a few pieces. Is either inherently easier to play with? Not  -- I mean, the little tiny Tinkertoy might be less intimidating for me to mess with and add my own stuff to than something enormous, but then again I might be more worried about messing up something so little by making the slightest change.<br/>
<br/>
So SIZE isn't the primary issue. It matters, but other things matter more. Imagine two Tinkertoys that each use the exact same number of pieces -- heck, even the exact same kinds of pieces -- but that are radically different SHAPES: One is a sprawling spiderlike structure with lots of long, thin arms sticking out; and the other is a dense three-dimensional grid, like the framework of an office building.<br/>
<br/>
NOW: Which is easier to modify for your own creative purposes, either by adding new elements or subtracting old ones -- the closed, dense grid, or the open, spidery structure?<br/>
<br/>
It's the open structure, obviously. Don't like a particular arm? You can snap it off, easy, and click something else in you do like. Want to add a new piece? Just click it onto one of the existing arms -- there's plenty of places to attach it, and even if what you add on is pretty big, there's plenty of empty space between the arms for it to fit into. What's more, because the structure's got a lot of sprawling arms already, anything sprawling you add on will look like it fits with the rest, rather than as if it's tacked on.<br/>
<br/>
By contrast, anything you add onto the grid will look weird if it's not a simple extension of the gridwork, or alternatively a little tiny piece that fits into the limited empty area inside the grid. If you want to do something of a radically different shape, you need to take half the grid apart to make room.<br/>
<br/>
The problem isn't really the AMOUNT of existing material: It's the DENSITY.<br/>
<br/>

                            An old-school D&amp;D dungeon module is, literally, a closed, high-density gridwork: There is nowhere the protagonists can do that is not already defined -- mapped out, stocked with specific inhabitants (monsters) and objects (treasure), and described in the "box text." There is  you can do creatively to that closed, high-density object without ripping out an existing piece first.<br/>
<br/>
But once you get out of the dungeon, in the ancient days before "Forgotten Realms" was published, you were in open, low-density, with a few strong struts to latch onto: You're in some sort of fantastical sort-of-medieval kingdom with monsters, magic, elves, and dwarves, and there's a town nearby where you can buy a set list of stuff, and that's IT. Want to invent a character, a city, a kingdom? Sure: Just grab a hex or ten on the blank map and start drawing.<br/>
<br/>
Now, compare the  setting (pre-1983, before the Extended Universe clogged it with crap). Looks pretty wide open, right? Millions of planets, millennia of history,plenty of blank canvas -- except the part we all cared about first, the pivotal events around the fall of the Empire, is filled in, and the rest is damned sketchy. So we've got an incredibly dense core, and then a bunch of struts sticking on that are, frankly, too weak to build much onto as-is.<br/>
<br/>
Now, compare the REAL WORLD. At first glance, this seems massively dense: There is literally nowhere you can go that doesn't have something there. Question is, <br/>
<br/>
I looked over John Kim's "Sillicon Valley Vampire Slayer" Buffy campaign, and while it refers to plenty of real places I could find online --  Redwood City,  Big Sur, Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, even a Buddhist temple in Mountain View (actually, there're several) -- it puts businesses and people in those places without bothering to check who actually was at such-and-such an address -- I don't think you all had a  Buddhist temple in Mountain View in mind, and if you did, I presume you did not actually discover they were involved in nefarious supernatural activities?<br/>
<br/>
My reading of John Kim and his group is that they used "the real world" as a vast toolkit of evocative places and institutions, but not as "canon" to abide by without room for contradiction or invention. That means the "Sillicon Valley" of the game, even setting aside the supernatural elements, is as much John &amp; co.'s own invention as Narnia is C.S. Lewis's, or Middle-Earth is Tolkein's -- and before anyone faints, remember how much both those authors loved the real-world landscape of rural England, loathed the wastelands created by modern industry and World War I, and incorporated those elements into their imagined setting.<br/>
<br/>
I've been talking about setting here, primarily, but the same principles apply to character generation: If I have a GURPS-style sheet filled with dozens of specific skills and attributes, or a freeformer-style character history filled with dozens of specific incidents, I've left myself little room to define what  that character is about without either (a) ripping out something I already have or (b) creating something only tangentially connected.<br/>
<br/>
Whereas if I have a -style character sheet, I know a bunch of important things about my character in really vivid detail -- "I can't shoot worth a darn 2d4," "I have prophetic dreams 1d10" -- but there's plenty of empty space in between and all around to build off into. Same with the  setting: There are a few evocative broad strokes -- the long arms of the spidery structure -- and lots of cool Western details about guns, coats, the Faith, what's in a typical town -- the little points of attachment where you click new parts in -- but there's plenty of room all around.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with lots of details is not having a lot of detail: It's that the more detail you put into your setting, or your character, or your other preparation before play, the harder it is to avoid filling in all the blank places for further creation. You  create richly detailed settings or elaborately detailed characters with lots of room for further creativity, but you have to be damned deliberate about the structure as you do it and make sure you keep building struts and points-of-attachment outwards rather than closing in and filling-in. (Remember basic solid geometry: As an object increases in volume, its ratio of surface area to volume -- its potential openness to the outside -- , unless you deliberately change its shape).<br/>
<br/>
And to end with a manifesto moment:<br/>
<br/>
Roleplaying is a creative endeavor.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike reading books and comics, or watching movies and plays, or contemplating the Mona Lisa, it is not primarily about appreciating someone else's creativity: It is about expressing your  creativity.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike writing books or plays, and a bit like making a movie, and very much like improv theater, it is not about expressing your own creativity : It is about expressing your creativity  with other people so that your best ideas feed off each other to create something none of you could have imagined on your own.<br/>
<br/>
Cool settings created by others are great -- as long as the setting, and your own attitude, give you creative space to move from appreciating the creativity of others to expressing your own.<br/>
<br/>
Cool character creation and other preparation before play is great -- as long as the procedures for prep, and your own attitude, give you creative space to move from expressing your own creativity alone to expressing your creativity in synergy with other people.<br/>
<br/>
WE ARE ALL CREATIVE. Let's do something with it.                        </div>

                            Sydney: That is an excellent, *definitive* article, but can i throw a twist onto it?<br/>
<br/>
As i grok it, The *best* settings are those tinkertoy structures we can feel free to add onto to our heart's content *without* rearranging any of the parts that are already in place.<br/>
<br/>
So the *best* guide to making a setting tells us how to arrange that structure properly, as we are making it.<br/>
<br/>
It occurs to me that an ideal guide like this could/would see little difference between pre-creation and in-play-creation, between group and solitary authorship.                        </div>

                            Of course Star Wars and Middle Earth are also slightly different cases than non-liscenced RPG settings. A setting that was built around a story, and has had its story told, has a different structure than a setting that was built to tell stories from. <br/><br/>The fact that a lot of RPers don't get that problably has much to do with the way settings have been published. Tribe 8, for example, fell into the trap of trying to fix it by building a setting and telling the story of the setting through publication rather than setting it up to be told through actual play.                        </div>

                            Cool discussion.  <br/><br/>I'm going to suggest an odd possibility here.  A difference might be that I'm <i>not</i> necessarily interested in exploring setting -- whereas some other people are.  That is, to other people it is very important that they be able to freely define what street they're on, or how far it is to Lionsbreath Falls, and so forth.  I'm perfectly fine with that being all completely defined.  It doesn't feel like a restriction to me because it isn't important to me that I creatively invent setting during the game.  <br/><br/>For example, I recently played in a game which was set entirely in a single, fairly sparse room -- this was the "Mirror Room" game from Shifting Forest Storyworks.  So that had nearly zero exploration of setting.  Instead, it had a lot of exploration of character.  <br/><br/>My concept for the "Dawn of Fire" campaign is similar: it's set within dungeons where everything is completely mapped out and everything inside defined.  What we would concentrate on is the action, the characters, and the relationships.  <br/><br/>Does that ring true for anyone?  Is exploration of setting important to you?  If not, would you be comfortable in a game which did without it, by having setting that was 100% predetermined (like a closed-room game or a small island game)?  If neither of the above, what is the problem with high-density, strongly defined setting if you can still take actions within it?                        </div>

                            Sydney, I agree with vast tracts of that, but I suspect you and I like the same sort of games.<br/><br/>What about those folks who want a game that's a dense gridwork?  People do actually enjoy Glorantha and Jorune and the like, and they enjoy playing in them as well as talking about them.<br/><br/>I like the spider vs gridwork illustration, but I'm thinking that one's not better than the other -- one's just better than the other for specific applications.  Spiderworks are good for games where the players create and modify large portions of the game; gridwords are good for games where the players don't.                        </div>

<p>See, to me it matters that that stuff remains undefined because <em>it does not matter to me.</em> If it is present it impinges, infects, fills my experience with undesired and wasteful information. It draws attention away from the good stuff and puts it on the boring stuff.</p>

<br/>
I'd agree, emphatically. To start with, it's an extension of the classic Ron Edwards "my GM Herbie" efficiency principle from "System Does Matter," which is that while your GM or your group can indeed junk any rules or setting elements that get in the way, it'd be a lot less work if the obstacles weren't there in the first place. So the ideal structure is one that suggests and guides without constraining: <br/>
- "ah, this is a spidery hub-and-spokes thing, so I can make the end of this spoke a new hub and radiate more spokes out of it"<br/>
- "ah, this is a continent surrounded by ocean, so I can make some islands over here"<br/>
- "ah, this is a mythic setting soaked in anthropology and culture clashes, so I can make a new kingdom torn between the new Lunar Way and tribal tradition over here and customize its funky magic thusly." (I've not played any Glorantha games, but I suspect that while it's a massive setting, it's actually not that dense in an obstructive way --  "Your Glorantha May Vary" is a much better mindset for a company to promote than "Buy our Metaplot!").<br/>
<br/>
Shreyas, I think you and I find the same things exciting or tedious, but "matters" / "doesn't matter" is a side point, really, and mainly a matter of personal taste. What really gets to me is when the predefined thing that matters most to someone, and which they find most exciting, completely stymies their ability to move on to create something of their own -- the  problem.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, John, I actually think whether or not people like "exploration of setting" is a tangent. At least, it's a tangent until we separate out<br/>
 (a) the people who want to "explore setting" by finding out stuff predefined by someone else, and who'd love a "dense, closed gridwork,"<br/>
from<br/>
 (b) the people who want to "explore setting" by creating new stuff, either completely on the fly or as a logical extrapolation from some predefined element, who'd love a "low density, open spiderwork."<br/>
from<br/>
 (c) the people who don't want to "explore setting" in either sense, but who find any big blank patches in the setting very distracting from their focus on something else, and who feel more comfortable with high-density<br/>
from<br/>
 (d) the people who don't want to "explore setting" in either sense, but who find lots of extraneous setting detail very distracting from their focus on something else, and who feel more comfortable with low-density. (This, I think, is Shreyas).                        </div>

                            It looks to me like there are two axes here:<br/><br/>The details of the setting are important to me / The details of the setting are unimportant to me except insofar as they directly affect the foreground events and characters<br/><br/>I prefer the details to be laid down already / I prefer to invent or co-invent the details when they seem relevant<br/><br/>What's interesting to me is that the causality seems to work both ways. Some people want to invent the details because they are important; some people regard the details as important because they invent them.

If the vampiric hierarchy of the city is over there, and the GM makes the PCs interact with this Nosferatu that's not at all connected with that hierarchy, and sends them off to fight some werewolves to get some McGuffin or something, then that hierarchy isn't being manipulated in any way, shape, or form.<br/><br/>However, if the vampiric hierarchy of the city is defined and two of the PCs are affiliated with two of the big muckymucks and the GM has the Prince command the PCs to do something that arises out of that balance of power -- whether or not the balance of power actually <em>shifts</em> the players have "manipulated" the hierarchy in that they've added two minions to it (the PCs) and set it in motion not directed by the book (the Prince's orders).  They're probably also illustrated a lot of the power dynamics involved -- setting filligrees and details onto the larger framework, as it were.<br/><br/>From my vantage, the benefit and the enjoyment of setting material is that it is <em>used</em> -- which often entails creatively selecting some elements, relating them together, and setting them into motion.  (Also known as creating the situation.)  So the details are important here because they're the playdough that the players shape with.<br/><br/>Does anybody like a whole lot of setting material to their games because they like it to be over there, not being referenced or addressed?                        </div>

                            Great discussion. Some stray points that come to my mind:<br/>
<br/>
1) "Two hobbies under one umbrella" -- a-yup. I've made the distinction elsewhere between actual play and "lonely fun," which is of course pejorative of the things you enjoy by yourself.<br/>
<br/>
2) "Manipulate" -- may I suggest the alternative "engage with"? It's a better fit for "have some kind of meaningful interaction with," I think.<br/>
<br/>
3) This whole "being blocked from your own creativity by the very thing you love and admire" explains the Fantasy Heartbreaker, too. If you look at old-school D&amp;D as a system in terms of the Tinkertoy analogy, it has a really dense grid of combat rules, a slightly more open structure of magic rules, and a few sketchy, weak struts for everything else. The Heartbreaker folks are trapped in that dense area, unable to get out, repeating certain assumptions about combat and magic again and again and again.<br/>
<br/>
4) Credit where credit is due: Everyone should realize that my thinking on this is at most mere logical extrapolation from, and in the main my personal rephrasing of, what Ron Edwards has been saying (and Vincent Baker, chief among others, expanding upon) for years.                        </div>

These aren't details to be referenced in game or made a part of play, but simply convey a feeling.

<blockquote>jhkim:<br/><br/>Hmmm. Can you give any examples of what kind of world-building you like, and which you consider a mistake? Your example reminds me of the sort of material that I tend to skip over in reading a setting. I'll maybe glance at one or two sentences like that, but to me they're mostly pointless. There's no way that I can memorize the exact text, and it has no defined meaning that I can remember and use in play.</blockquote>
The bit I quoted above <i>isn't</i> the end-product of worldbuilding - although it could certainly be included in the marginalia, as in <i>Nobilis</i>.  But certainly writing short passages from various PoV characters (preferrably outsiders or travellers) gives you the eyes to see the setting not only from a fresh perspective, but from a ground-level perspective.  Most worldbuilding is about the god's-eye persepctive - this continent here, populated by these people, with these major national/cultural groups.<br/><br/>Someone on the ground - actually <i>in</i> the setting, doesn't have that sort of knowledge - they take in the surroundings on the level of the details here: the five senses, custom and cultural cues.  By building the world from the details up instead of the top down, I've found that it creates much more emergent behavior - more complexity, and certainly more unpredictability.  There was one instance where I was working on a setting and I found out, quite without meaning to, that one of the species (I prefer 'species' over 'race') was going to be a bunch of real fuckers.  I didn't start out with that in mind, but it made a lot of sense as I kept shaping the setting and since it was an elf-equivalent in the setting, it really threw off the players.
<blockquote>If the setting gives me sensible information which I can visualize and understand, then I can remember it and extend from it. So "Greenhaven is a thriving town of 5000 which is in the hilly country at the upper end of the Bright River which runs through the country of Queensland." That makes sense to me. Particularly if there's a map showing the country and river, I can form a picture in my head of it and I can make up my own cool characters and places in the town during play. In contrast, suppose I read "Greenhaven is officially an tertiary district of Dellslandau, whose abnormally high production of copperbrew in recent years has troubled the District Administrator." I'll tend to simply ignore that and it's unlikely to come up in play.</blockquote>
The difference between those two entries, to me, is that the one is static and the other dynamic.  The first passage just ends with 'so fucking what?'  Nothing in that tells me why I'd ever want to go there.  The second is much more intriguing - first of all, it hints at the cultural context of the place, I know they make copperbrew (but I have no idea what it is, so that makes me curious), and I know something about the situation as well, which is dynamic and intriguing (Why is copperbrew such an issue?  And who am I going to side with in the conflict?)<br/><br/>The first passage is information that I'll need at some point to locate Greehaven, but I have to <i>want to go there</i> before I care to find (or place) it on the map.  Of course those exact details may not come into play - but good setting material makes you want to work that stuff in somehow, even as background noise.<br/><br/>Copperbrew for everyone!                        </div>

I don't mean to say that there's <i>no</i> place for geographic/encyclopedic setting information.  For one thing, climate and other factors are incredibly important to custom and culture.  And I draw maps all the freakin' time - I have a thing with them too.  One of my most detailed settings, the Islands of St. Etienne, which I have detailed down to the field of Ulubine Red (an exotic wheat) and the name of the chandler's wife in Sotho, started out as a spot on a much larger map that I decided would be a good crossroads for various world-spanning events, but only on the periphery of any one, so that the islands had a lot of little nudges this way and that, but were essentially independent of all the world's major cultures.<br/><br/>All that information is <i>important to know</i>, but only as bedrock for the more interesting stuff.                        </div>

                            See, I really don't like "engage with" because it can be read as pretty passive, whereas I'm talking about something that is pretty profoundly proactive.  Players in this sense are taking things that are laid out, picking some of them up, and putting them together.  They're playing with them, building things with them, fiddling with them.  "Engaging" can be 'gee, that was so cool I was just drawn to engage with it' when it's really 'gee, that was so cool that I just had to <em>pick it up and do something with it</em>.'

I'm not sure about bottom-up vs top-down, but I completely agree that the view of life of people on the ground is critical for me.  I commented in the setting material thread that "<i>I like a setting where I can picture what real life is like for the people in the world.</i>"  That's the stuff that I like, because to me it makes it easier to play my character as a person rather than a pawn.  I think it's possible to get to this from either bottom-up or top-down as far as design.  <br/><br/>(I cited settings I liked muchly as Aberrant, Amber, Ars Magica, GURPS Goblins, GURPS Voodoo, Hârn, Jorune, Paranoia, and Puppetland.  And settings I didn't like so much as 7th Sea, Blue Rose, Castle Falkenstein, Code of Unaris, and Riddle of Steel.)  <br/><br/>As for static versus dynamic (i.e. my two examples from Greenhaven), I find it a little odd.  To me the setting, almost by definition, is going to be mostly static.  That is, the "setting" is the static background, while the dynamic stuff is in the foreground.  The dynamic is the characters and situation.  Maybe this is just a different way of using the terms?  So, the reason why your character wants to go to Greenhaven is part of the situation.                        </div>

                            John just hit on something that clarifies my preferences. If I find a situation intriguing enough, the setting (the static stuff) really isn't that critical to my enjoyment. My attention is riveted to exploring the situation and I only need the setting in so far as it informs the situation.<br/>

                            I find this thread quite an eye-opener, giving meaning to stuff that's been running through my head for quite a while now.<br/>
<br/>
I had an inkling of something akin to this when I looked at Exalted. And again a week ago when I looked for a game to run at our local annual convention. I settled on Armageddon. I went and re-read the books, and it was so cool it made me want to play it.<br/>
<br/>
But what was cool? The setting. The color. Those things that are traditionally "selling" roleplaying games. I've played AD&amp;D2ed for years on the basis of setting/color alone. Even moreso for Earthdawn (well, the resolution mechanic was beautiful too, but that wasn't the "hook"). Frikkin' years. And yes, it *was* super-cool for Exalted and Armageddon. But something didn't click.<br/>
<br/>
Exalted was my epiphany, so to speak. Reading the basic book three times over, I went "so what do you *do*?" and then just ditched it. You'd think I should've known better than selecting Armageddon for a game, on the basis of setting. But no. Hell, I *knew* what you do in Armageddon. You fight Leviathan and the CoR. And it's cool and stuff, right? (Well, not really, no. The system sucks for combat, for any conflict for that matter.) And the backstory, it had such cool stuff happening!<br/>
<br/>
The backstory is the crux of the problem. I got the feeling that *everything* cool has already happened. That whatever I will do it will never compare to the Munich Massacre, or the Battle of Rome, or even some of the fiction in the game text. In short - too much detail, and all of it just too damn good. I'm seriously thinking of just presenting cool characters and a in-your-balls kicker and consigning all the nifty background material to the trash bin. Hey, I bet the players in the 'con never read Armageddon anyway. At least I hope so.                        </div>

<blockquote>jhkim: As for static versus dynamic (i.e. my two examples from Greenhaven), I find it a little odd. To me the setting, almost by definition, is going to be mostly static. That is, the "setting" is the static background, while the dynamic stuff is in the foreground. The dynamic is the characters and situation. Maybe this is just a different way of using the terms? So, the reason why your character wants to go to Greenhaven is part of the situation.</blockquote>
I see that as a very narrow interpretation of setting.  I don't think that setting and situation are really that easily parsed out from each other - the setting looks the way it looks because of situation, and situation arises from the setting because of the interaction of the components of the setting.  You can't have a goblin uprising unless you've got goblins and the conditions necessary for revolution.<br><br>But that's a bottom-up interpretation.  A top-down interpretation is that there's going to be a situation in this area, and I'll impose whatever changes on the setting are required to make it fit.  Either works, from a god's-eye perspective.  But I find that bottom-up construction of situation creates richer situation, and there's less margin of error because the preconditions for situation all 'feel right'.                        </br></br></div>
