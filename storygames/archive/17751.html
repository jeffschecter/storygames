It features three of my games - God-king, The Legerdemain Betrayers, and Haunt Me. There's also two playtest drafts and high-resolution wallpapers included with the bundle for anyone interested in game development (seeing where God-king and The Legerdemain Betrayers started out) or desktop decorum, respectively. <br/><br/>For me, the coolest thing about the bundle is releasing my newest game, Haunt Me, which I've been brewing for a bit now. It's a very short, experimental game that focuses on a group of players that is forced to discuss the guilt they harbor to a bunch of strangers whilst in a haunted house. It would be really great to hear you all think about it. <br/><br/>You can get a look at the bundle over on my site: <a href="http://spiffup.org/endoftheworld" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://spiffup.org/endoftheworld</a> It'll run until January 2nd.<br/><br/>I pulled an all-nighter for this release (hit a lot of last-minute bumps) so I apologize in advance if there are any hitches with the site or the bundle itself. Please let me know either here or via email (danielcruzchan@gmail.com) if there's any problems you run into.<br/><br/>Thanks everyone and happy new year!<br/>-Daniel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401819/#Comment_401819" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T07:23:57+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  7:23AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmmmmm...<br/>Even though I already have <b>God-King</b>, I think I may have to go for this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable" title="wicked.fable"><img alt="wicked.fable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/614786/Avatar_48x50.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable">wicked.fable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401856/#Comment_401856" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T15:27:47+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  3:27PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2012 4:54PM by wicked.fable.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">@stupidgremlin</a>: If you do get the bundle, I hope you enjoy the other two games and the extra content!

Thanks for your generous contribution.<br/><br/>Just as a general note, I should let you all know that I have added an option to get the bundle through Paypal. I originally had some emails from people who couldn't use Paypal or preferred to directly use their card so I thought I would try another service that allows that as a main option. Both options are now up, though, so you can choose to get the bundle either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut" title="Colinaut"><img alt="Colinaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/154/n10HRNISYS3H0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colinaut">Colinaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401859/#Comment_401859" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T15:51:44+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  3:51PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Already had God-King but went ahead and got the bundle as I like your stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil" title="m_busuttil"><img alt="m_busuttil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/m_busuttil">m_busuttil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401862/#Comment_401862" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T15:58:48+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  3:58PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you don't mind my asking, what do you normally charge for the three PDFs individually?

Haunt Me is a bit of a special case as it is currently only available with this bundle. As it is a shorter game, content-wise, I would probably place it at $2. But if you're looking at this as more of a great way to save some money on the games, please don't let those prices stop you from going as low as you want.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401925/#Comment_401925" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-28T07:46:54+00:00" title="December 28, 2012  7:46AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>EDIT: Just noticed you did get the bundle.

If any of you have problems, please don't hesitate to let me know either here or at danielcruzchan@gmail.com I have tested the download process for myself and had some friends do the same - so far we haven't encountered any problems so I am unsure of what the cause could be outside of the downloads being interrupted somehow.<br/><br/>In any case, thank you all for your support of the bundle so far!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_402501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable" title="wicked.fable"><img alt="wicked.fable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/614786/Avatar_48x50.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wicked.fable">wicked.fable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/402501/#Comment_402501" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-02T13:00:52+00:00" title="January  2, 2013  1:00PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey all,<br/><br/>Just as a heads-up, the problem with extracting the contents of the .zip file for the bundle has been sorted out. I was using a compression method only supported by newer software and, even at that, still specific ones only - this explains why some people could extract it while others could not. I went ahead and used a legacy compression method so the bundle should now be fully extractable by any program you use to do that. I would like to apologize to those of you that have had problems with the zip file. You can use the same link to re-download the file in order to get the updated version - if you've lost that link just let me know. <br/><br/>Anyway, I hope everyone has been having a happy new year. As a reminder, there's less than 12 hours left to get the bundle if you still would like to check it out!<br/><br/>Thanks for all of your support, Story Gamers!<br/>-Daniel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
