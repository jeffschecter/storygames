We played it for about 6 sessions before I began hacking it into what would eventually become <a href="http://bleedingplay.wordpress.com/geiger/" rel="nofollow">Geiger Counter</a>.  It's definitely chock full of great ideas (Conditions, Victimization), but we didn't really find the existing set of rules to be great in play.<br/><br/>There's no moral judgement and religion in Afraid because there doesn't need to be.  I'm not sure why you think that's a problem.  That's just not what the game's about. It's still about tough decisions and judgment, interestingly enough, because the characters are trying to track down (and perhaps free) the victims / pawns of the monster, while not being destroyed themselves.  But, at least when we played, it wasn't always clear what the best course of action was or even who was a victim and who was a willing servant.<br/><br/>The problem we encountered in Afraid is the open-ended nature of the struggle with the monster.  There's this back-and-forth as the monster tries to increase the number of victims while the group tries to free the victims and weaken the monster.  But progress along this path is really unsatisfying in play, because either the characters always win (boring!) or the success of the monster drags the game on and on.  There really needs to be a way for both sides to gain an advantage or both sides to lose, or some kind of spiral / endgame built in for play to progress towards.  Horror itself is not a genre that traditionally appears in satisfying long-form formats -- things like The Walking Dead aside -- which makes it hard to know how to pace Afraid campaigns because there's nothing to really compare them to.  Without a sense of progress or development towards something, we found ourselves adrift after a while.<br/><br/>That said, I learned a lot from playing Afraid and, hopefully, a lot of that good stuff appears in Geiger Counter.  I just made it shorter (single-session), more focused, and drove towards a clearly existing horror genre (survival horror films).  The best suggestion Vincent gave me during the design process was to divorce it entirely from the core Afraid/Dogs mechanics, which clearly didn't fit what I was trying to do (and, I personally think, don't necessarily suit Afraid well either).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_179321">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
