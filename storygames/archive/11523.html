Or, something else entirely.<br/><br/>If the sci-fi saiko-hora of Burning Empires is more to your taste, let your stentor suit you up in hallowed Iron, scream a prayer to Amilahk down your comms, and step aboard the hammer battleship that's taking the fight right to the heart of the Vaylen. This time the fight goes to the Worm. Or, like, something else that rocks.<br/><br/>If Mouse Guard is more your thing, how cool would it be to play a whole Years worth of Seasons that surely must see the Territories crushed under the triple hammer blow of a cruel winter, ravenous critters, and an enemy within? Really Tiny Tim says to shout "Honk!" if you're keen. Honk! Or, you know, something just as cool or even awesome-er.<br/><br/>It's early days yet, so the project is still in the stages of soliciting interest. I reckon it's a games day as opposed to a mini-con. I know that I'm keen. If you're potentially interested, ...head on over to the <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/group.php?groupid=2" rel="nofollow">Burning Blighty</a> group over on the Burning Wheel forum and join the conversation.<br/><br/>Sho ga nai, cheers<br/><br/>Pete</blockquote>\nAs Pete says, it's still early days but we'd like to have a small get-together to spread the love that are the Burning X games. We're still discussing dates, venues and numbers, and would love as much input as possible.<br/>John                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256836/#Comment_256836" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T14:00:24+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  2:00PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I endorse this event!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
