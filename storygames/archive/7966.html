The reward cycle is really what turns me off D&amp;D, it gets in the way of what I want to do and it spoils the game for me. It's not so much a reward as a distraction from the cool things that are going on with the characters and the story, the way the players express their characters and the way the GM (if there is one) does their stuff. The play is, in itself, its own reward.*<br/><br/>Does anyone else get that too?<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*YMMV etc. If you need rewards, I won't hate you.

By this <a href="http://games.spaceanddeath.com/yudhishthirasdice/80" rel="nofollow">I mean, the thing that makes play fun for me, over time</a>, often isn't what the game pushes or the game designers thought should be fun. <br/><br/>Thus my opinion of them becomes much like yours about D&amp;D and its reward cycle. (And yea, I don't like D&amp;Ds reward cycle.) <br/><br/>So I guess I don't dislike the concept of reward cycle, so much as I dislike some combination of specific reward cycles, and overly intrusive reward cycles that don't customize well. <br/><br/>(And please, God, if you exist and are bigger than other God, do not let this now become a thread about what "game" means.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176126/#Comment_176126" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T16:13:55+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  4:13PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem I have is that Reward Cycle is one of those terms that has been misapplied repeatedly.  A Reward Cycle is a unit of play that pays off socially.  It's what makes playing the game fun and worth doing over and over.  That MAY tie into player/character effectiveness but it doesn't have to.  That's where all the confusion comes in.  A Reward Cycle is not about mechanically conditioning behaviors out of players through some pavlovian process.<br/><br/>Spione, for example, has an almost surprisingly simple and blatantly obvious reward cycle.  It has two phases Maneuvers and Flashpoints.  Maneuvers are about winding up tension in the narrative and Flashpoints are about relieving that tension and spinning out its consequences.  It's rather like winding up a top and then letting it go.  And that's fun to do over and over.  And player/character effectiveness NEVER enters into it.  The mechanical "odds" are always the same throughout the whole process over and over.<br/><br/>The reason that we say GURPS lacks a reward cycle is not because the XP system isn't bound to specific player behaviors; it's because it doesn't tell you "how to play it" in the this is how you start, this how you proceed and this is how you end manner.  The group has to do that on their own.  You have to make your own game, so to speak.  Now if you take all those rules and run a dungeon crawl, you've introduced a reward cycle.  It's fun to go encounter to encounter overcoming challenges.  Now if take all those rules and run a clue-chain mystery then you've introduced a different reward cycle, it's fun to collect clues and piece the mystery together.<br/><br/>So I would say Reward Cycles are pretty damn necessary for play to function.  But no, it doesn't have to be tied to player effectiveness.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176129/#Comment_176129" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T16:20:16+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  4:20PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yah. The <i>effective</i> reward cycle in play is whatever cycle of tension and release that provides the emotional payoff in play. Mechanics can exist to accentuate or leverage a particular reward cycle, but you can certainly fight against them or subvert them to get your own cycle running. The <i>advantage</i> of structurally embedded reward cycles is that they make converging on a functional group dynamic for fun play quicker and easier - <b>provided the group is willing to buy into them</b>. The disadvantage is that they often provide mechanical feedback at cross purposes with whatever pre-existing set of priorities the group brings with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176135/#Comment_176135" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T16:49:05+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  4:49PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quite.

One of my favorite things to do when discussing reward cycles with someone deeply rooted in White Wolf and White Wolf related games is to ask, "How do you play your game?"

In games where it's made central it causes a pressure to focus on short chains of the cycle. It narrows the scope of aspects of the game you can easily enjoy. On the plus side, this brings players together so they will get the same things from the game consistently. But at the same time, this prevents players who want a deeper, more textured experience from achieving one. <br/><br/>The drift of reward cycle to become synonymous with any sort of reward or positive social outcome is at best an error in analysis, and at worst a (likely unconscious) attempt to enforce a singular way to play. <br/> <br/>   - Mendel S.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176421/#Comment_176421" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T11:56:10+00:00" title="October 27, 2008 11:56AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 27, 2008 11:57AM by GB_Steve.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK.

At least that's not how I've ever understood "reward cycle" in design talk. Usually, mechanical inducements have more to do with using the game's economics to, in turn, generate rewards. So in D&amp;D, you do stuff and you earn XPs. But XPs themselves don't make you more potent -- investing those XPs back into your character do. The feeling of potency is the reward for many players in D&amp;D, but there are several ways to accomplish that.<br/><br/>What do you find rewarding about playing an RPG?

The two are longtime friends and had been playing together for a long time, so I'd expected play to be pretty similar, but boy was I wrong. The system used was something of a "Fantasy Heartbreaker in Training" and provided nothing more then a thin crust of "pseudo-crunchy powerz" over a whole load of GM fiat. No XP and no mechanical support for any reward cycle whatsoever. Well, not more then the "reward cycle" of a coin throw anyway.<br/><br/>When K ran the game, it was ... pretty boring. Because the system did almost no work, beyond bits of color and a few powerz, everything relied on the player and the GM. Or, actually, only the GM, except that he was pretty hard on the blocking thing, with player input regularly being discarded or just made boring and unfun by "the roll of the dice", which only really served as a "High roll bad, low roll good" excuse for GM to decide what really happened. With no mechanical reward cycle to bite into and the social cycle being something like "Player puts [idea he's excited about] on the table, rolls decide, GM blocks it half the time", it ran as smoothly as a square wheel. The players regularly created tiny reward cycles amongst themselves as they complimented each other on ideas and shared jokes when the GM didn't say anything, but it felt a bit desperate. Like we where trying really hard to find some smooth play in there somewhere, even if it had to be outside the game propper.<br/><br/>When M ran the game, the experience was really different. Oh, sure, the system was the same and was used in very much the same way (ie. it played no real role beyond being some kind of coin toss and inspiration for the GM) but where K blocked player input, M took it and made it interesting, thus producing moe interesting input from the players and so on. Even "bad" results of the dice where combined with player input and spun into something that was rewarding to the players. <br/><br/>I didn't realize it at the time, getting only that this was way more fun, but where the first game never really got a good reward cycle going, the second ran smoothly as the GM and the players rewarded each other for their input and each made the others ideas more fun. Interestingly, I think that if K, ie. the first game, had used some system with support for a mechanical RC, whether D&amp;D, PtA or whatever, it would have been much more fun as we could have attached outselves to that and used it to fuel the game. But without the system doing any work and the GM blocking, the only way to get rewarding play where "outside" jokes between the players. <br/><br/>I wonder how the second game would have been changed had it used different system. Would probably depend on which "style" of cycle would have been more interesting to the group. <br/><br/>Hmmm, interesting stuff to think about.<br/><br/>[/Aaron tells a story that was bumped lose in his head by the thread]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176468">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176468/#Comment_176468" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T16:05:42+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  4:05PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reward cycles are a feature of Creative Agenda, which is why they aren't that easy peg down mechanically. Listen to Jesse, he knows his rpg theory (which is useful if you actually want to discuss the concept of "reward cycle" as established at the Forge). For example, D&amp;D - sure, it has all sorts of reward <i>mechanics</i>, but the actual rewards powered by these mechanics are non-mechanical: gaining xp allows your character to do new things he couldn't before, and makes tasks that were difficult easier, which in turn allows the character to graduate from goblin-slaying to saving kingdoms from dragons.<br/><br/>(Reward cycles are part of Creative Agenda because the reward you're cycling for is that agenda - in case of Gamist D&amp;D, opportunities to face and overcome different challenges. XP in this context allows you to take on more prestigious challenges as you earn the right to face that dragon, while it also acts as a badge of honor when your character carries his heroic history in the form of a large xp total with him.)<br/><br/>Best Friends has a reward cycle just like all these other games, but what it is depends on how you play it. The way I've seen it run, it's vanilla narrativism: the reward comes from tying these characters into a social web, introducing tension and resolving it. It's nearly non-mechanical in Best Friends (but not non-systematic, note), but that's just what reward cycles are - when they're being backed by mechanics, the actual psychological processes we call intentional reward seeking are still necessarily non-mechanical. In the case of a game with lots of freeforming parts like Best Friends I could easily imagine establishing different sorts of reward cycles, too; the reward cycle can only get established in relation to what the group and the players are trying to do in the game.<br/><br/>My message for the folks who disclaim xp hunting in D&amp;D is that it might be useful to think a bit about the reward cycles you follow yourself - the fact that you like to do things D&amp;D provides no systemic support for does not mean that understanding your reward cycles wouldn't be useful. If nothing else, you can stop distributing xp and start focusing on the things you find enjoyable in the game, if you don't just decide to switch games and play something with explicit mechanical support for whatever it is that floats your boat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176500/#Comment_176500" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T21:45:57+00:00" title="October 27, 2008  9:45PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I encourage the big model folks on this thread take a little time and consider play outside of the big model.

And fanmail do exactly that.<br/><br/>But this also focus the game strongly on that kind of reward, and may overshadow other forms of rewards.<br/><br/>So I got this idea (and this is only a hypothesis I admit) that if the reward you get from a rpg is the combination of different things in the game. For example it could be equal part social reward, the enjoyment of developing your character and the excitement to see the next plot twist. But where an overly focus on one of these things would tilt the balance, and ruin the enjoyment.<br/><br/>A strong explicit reward cycle will nearly always focus on one element of the game, and so will never satisfy a player who need a more broad spectrum of reward. In this case a game without a build-in reward cycle would be better.<br/><br/><br/>Sorry if this does not make any sense.<br/><br/> - Anders                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176534/#Comment_176534" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T06:29:49+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  6:29AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Following this thread has been frustrating.

I also use, explain, and study other models of play, such as sockets, RPGs as ritual, and my own developments. Each of these works better in different situations. <br/><br/>Reward cycle, as a concept, is one of the core linchpins of the big model, as a foundation for creative agenda. This is based on a conceptual model of what reward cycles are. As we drift from that core, it brings us into shaky big model territory. At this point we owe it to ourselves to question whether we should consider another RPG model or even that we're entering less explored territory.<br/><br/>I offered words of caution from my experience.

I also find playing-for-cookies unsatisfying (never mind how the phrase "reward cycle" may have been defined by a particular group elsewhere). That approach in both play style and game design seems, to me, to introduce a fundamental conflict of interest -- assuming the cookies you're chasing don't actually feed back into what you care about at the table.<br/><br/>Funny you invoke Luke's name in all this. I've houseruled BW very slightly to break up what I felt was a conflict of interest in BW's playing-for-cookies structure: the advancement system. While I think the ability advancement system (improve what you use) is neat, it also promotes the player chasing advancement opportunities. Unfortunately, it's far too easy to let the advancement chase overwhelm the meat of the game, which IMO is chasing Beliefs. So, while we haven't changed the system at all, I'm asking the players simply log their rolls on a separate sheet of paper and determine advancement during their down-time (between scenes, when they're off-screen, end of session, etc.). That little bit of space is enough to remove the Pavlovian urgency and encourages the players to stay focused on just their Beliefs.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176691/#Comment_176691" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T10:02:04+00:00" title="October 29, 2008 10:02AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't believe in any part of the Big Model below the Social level (ah but what a level that is), but I definitely think reward cycles, or, to use a much more accurate term that will never ever ever ever catch on, reward rhythms, are extremely important and are well-known and examined in other games, especially computer games.<br/><br/>What is the reward rhythm in Super Mario Brothers? Well, there's the first time you jump on a goomba and it goes flat. Woo! You do a few of those and get the hang of it and, hey, there's a koopa, it leaves a shell, wow, that's new...there's the first time you become invincible, then the first time you realize you can duck down and go into a pipe.  Once you have the basics down, there are new types of more advanced rewards available - the first time you navigate a tricky set of jumps around a bunch of fireballs - the first time you defeat Bowser - the first time you get past a big group of marching enemies - the first warp zone you find, and the game continues to throw new situations at you. Eventually once you've seen it all and developed your skills sufficiently, the game gives out in terms of its reward rhythm and it gets old. You've jumped on 10,000 goombas, there's no conceivable way the game can give you any situation where that is fun anymore.  However, for some people, there are still out-of-game rewards that can be sought to keep the game fresh: speedrunning, killing the minimum number of monsters, and so on.<br/><br/>Team Fortress 2 (a team-based multiplayer first person shooter) has a great reward cycle. Immediately after you are blown to pieces, 2 things happen:<br/><br/>1 - you get a freeze cam shot of the person who killed you so you can go after them<br/>2 - you get a message saying "You survived longer as a pyro that time than your previous best!" or "You almost built as many buildings that time as your previous best!" or "You healed almost as many points of damage as your previous best!" Something to tell you your progress as an individual, to show how your skills are developing. With an overall "Performance Report" between maps showing you the number of points you've obtained on each class and the amount of time you've spent playing each, you can see where you need to improve and where you are strong.<br/><br/>Now that's an immediate 1-4 minute reward rhythm - improving your skills, and it gives you the jolt of enjoyment right after you get blown up and feel the letdown of defeat.<br/><br/>There's another 5-10 minute reward rhythm in TF2 - the map. Each map has a time limit and usually several sub-objectives.  Certainly the reward rhythm is such that you can expect to have a little thrill of achievement every 2-3 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Finally, an "invisible" reward rhythm in TF2 is the critical chance - every time you fire, there's a chance that whatever it is you're firing will do critical damage if it hits.  The game determines whether it's a critical by a formula that includes how well you're doing - if you are hitting a lot of people with your shots, the chances of you scoring a critical go way up for a brief time. This means you get not only the reward of doing well, but a big boost to continue to do well. Then if you get overconfident, rush out and get killed, you only come back down to where you were, because you've done such heinous damage to the other side.<br/><br/>The applicability of reward rhythms to RPGs is great. The character effectiveness boost of: a new item, another level, a new power, a new strategy, a new piece of information, and so on, should be looked at not just by designers (yawn) but also by gaming groups themselves. How often do you want or need to get that jolt when you're playing? If your game has a GM, how often do you need to give them a thrill?<br/><br/>One way I try to keep a reward rhythm going is by emphasizing the characters' increasing badassery in the world. In D&amp;D, I have people rush up and ask for their autographs, I have them hear unbelievable rumors about themselves, I have local monarchs fete them, scrub monsters cower and blubber for their lives and hot chicks and dudes throw themselves at their feet swooning. I don't do this all the time - I do it when the game seems to lack energy, when the next level-up isn't for a while, when they've suffered a setback, when it seems like everyone's plodding along.  In superhero games I have them overhear thugs nervously wondering if and when they're going to come punch them, I have villains always, ALWAYS curse them wildly and get angry at everything they do (you would be surprised how many superhero GMs forget to do this), and I have the authorities nervously but relievedly say "they're here, thank god" when they show up.<br/><br/>There are a lot of non-mechanical rewards that can be given out no matter what the system, but definitely paying attention to the rhythm of rewards will help your game go further and faster. Check it out the next time you play a video game that seems well-designed. When are you getting a boost, when does the game drag? Is improving your skill fun or is it a drag until you're at a particular proficiency level? Once your skill reaches a certain point, does it get boring, or are there new challenges and situations to put your new skills to the test?  Is there more interesting material introduced, when is it introduced, and how?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner" title="Sean Nittner"><img alt="Sean Nittner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20Nittner">Sean Nittner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176694/#Comment_176694" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T10:19:23+00:00" title="October 29, 2008 10:19AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience GMing is that players are the most exited about seeing the ideas they have in their head for their character become real in the game.  This could range from achieving an epic goal to making the players to their left blush.  This kind of achievement may be rewarded mechanically, but it is certainly rewarded by the other player\u2019s responses and by the feeling of accomplishment.  The example that Aaron (Lord Minx) gives of M's game fits perfectly in this model.  The players brought ideas to the game and the rest of the players (specifically the GM in this case) validated them. That is a killer reward right there.<br/><br/>However, I also know that most of my players (at least in long term games) want to see their characters improve mechanically (my character is stronger, better at fixing cars or has a new power) and they want to have some kind of resource to bail them out when the dice betray them (fate chips, plot points, whatever).   Usually they are awarded by long term and short term rewards during play, simply by playing out their characters in the method described above.<br/><br/>Where I see a conflict, and where I sympathize with Steve is when the two agendas work at cross purposes.  When the thing the player wants to do isn't the thing that will offer their character a reward.  This causes a mixture of results.  Some people are addicted to the cookie, others will make it a point to be a purist role-player (if such a thing exists) and actively work against the mechanical reward system to prove all they care about is staying true to their character.   Most however will go back and forth and be left with a mildly dissatisfied feeling.  If they go for the cookie, they feel disappointed they didn't say truer to their original ideals.  If they stick to their guns, they become envious of other players getting cookies.  <br/><br/>I've tried to merge these interests whenever possible, but I do agree sometimes they are disparate and that can cause dissatisfaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176714/#Comment_176714" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T13:06:04+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  1:06PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To point at a reward mechanic that has maximal flexibility in letting players drive the pace and content of their reward cycle, Keys in tSOY do that. Players pick them. They go off when the player decides they should (and not when they don't). They can be discarded and changed pretty much at will. But they still drive play towards what the player thinks is fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176744/#Comment_176744" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-29T17:36:47+00:00" title="October 29, 2008  5:36PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was a really good post, Jason.
