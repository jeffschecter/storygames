I\u2019d love it if people could share their strategies or best practices here.<br/><br/><br/><b>Background</b><br/><br/>Over the last month, I\u2019ve introduced the game to my regular Tuesday night group \u2013 a few of whom are adverse to complicated rules systems or rules systems with too many parts. Bearing all of that in mind, I decided to think about the Marvel rules as a modular system and asked myself what were the core rules that I had to introduce, and what were the optional rules that could come later.<br/><br/>I was inspired by my memories of reading this article on how to introduce Polaris to people: <a href="http://www.mythic-cartography.org/2009/02/25/the-pedagogy-of-play-bite-sized-pieces-part-i/" rel="nofollow">The Pedagogy Of Play: Bite-Sized Pieces, Part I</a><br/><br/><br/><b>The Basics of Dice Rolling</b><br/><br/>To start with, I wanted people to be totally comfortable with the dice rolling in Marvel, as I\u2019d seen a few other groups stumble when it was taught to them.<br/><br/>I asked everybody to grab a fistful of dice at random and then roll them. I asked them to remove all the 1s, and then add the highest two dice together. We then all announced our totals and compared them.<br/><br/>We did that two or three times until everyone was comfortable with it, and then I added in the idea of the \u2018effect die\u2019.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Core of the Rules</b><br/><br/>After selecting characters and getting an idea how the team worked, I started play off by establishing how the initiative system works. We free-narrated one round of a fight between the heroes and a villain: not rolling any dice, just passing the turn from one player to another and describing what our heroes and villain did.<br/><br/>When I started the game for real, I tried to get to a fight as quickly as possible and told them to say what their hero would do. If there was no opposition or if failure would be boring, then it\u2019d be an automatic success.<br/><br/>As soon as someone had to roll, I took them through assembling a pool of dice, using <a href="http://boldpueblo.com/downloads/mhr/MHR-Dice-Pool-Assemble.pdf" rel="nofollow">the dice pool assembler strips</a> from boldpueblo.com to guide them.<br/><br/>If they narrated their hero doing something cool related to their powers (but which wasn\u2019t on their datafile), I pointed out they could spend 1PP to get a d8 STUNT die.<br/><br/>And, to keep the game moving quickly, I made sure to embed the idea of not spending a lot of time searching for dice to use or trying to justify a trait if it didn\u2019t apply<br/><br/><br/><b>Plot Points and Opportunities</b><br/><br/>At this point I started giving players a plot point for each 1 they rolled.<br/><br/>Because I was still learning the rules, what I didn\u2019t do (and I haven\u2019t decided yet whether I should have) was mention that that when the Watcher rolls 1s, the heroes can trigger one of their SFX for 1 PP. My doubt about introducing this so early on was that I found the players were still familiarizing themselves with the basics of their character sheets: it seemed to me that each player took a different amount of time to process everything that was on there and to start asking questions about how their SFX worked. I was pretty comfortable letting that stuff come up when only when people asked.<br/><br/><br/><b>Spending Effect Dice on Stress</b><br/><br/>To keep things simple for the first session, I simply said that Effect dice could be spent to inflict Mental, Physical or Emotional Stress.<br/><br/>I also ruled that heroes recovered all of their stress at the end of an action scene.<br/><br/>That were the only rules we used for Session One, except for emphasising that if there\u2019s no opposition or if failure would be boring, then whatever the heroes do an automatic success and they should describe it. Setting that up at the start meant people felt very free to narrate themselves doing superhero stuff.<br/><br/><br/><b>Slowly introducing the rest of the dice economy</b><br/><br/>By the start of Session Two, the players were pretty comfortable with dice rolling but some of them had forgotten about the Effect die: how to calculate it and what it was used for, so we went over the basics of dice rolling again.<br/><br/><br/>I introduced one or two new concept in each of Session we had after that, and only as they came up<br/>- using your own Stress (or another character\u2019s) as a source of extra dice<br/>- Assets<br/>- Complications<br/>- What to spent your plot points on.<br/><br/><br/><b>How to teach it better?</b><br/><br/>By that point everyone seemed fairly comfortable with the whole system, and I felt like after a few more sessions we\u2019d be pretty fluent with it.<br/><br/>But I\u2019m sure that I could improve how I presented and taught things. How would you do it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400276">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400276/#Comment_400276" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-09T22:55:25+00:00" title="December  9, 2012 10:55PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A lot of SFX have nothing to do with Watcher opportunities.

Generally, I briefly explain the Trait concept and then dive into play. Once it's time to roll, I walk them through assembling and rolling a pool. The main thing I tend to hold off on is dealing with PP, as the rules for using them to manipulate pools are incredibly fiddly. I also stick with using Effect dice only for Stress at first, introducing the concept of other uses later.<br/><br/>The hard part with Marvel is that the whole die pool process is so tightly integrated, and so all-encompassing, it's hard to leave bits out and still show what the game can do. The whole game is basically one big rule!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_400691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400691/#Comment_400691" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-13T12:32:12+00:00" title="December 13, 2012 12:32PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going through the articles on Strolen's Citadel and started to read <a href="http://strolen.com/viewing/Teaching_the_Rules" rel="nofollow">how the players taught the rules at Hogwart</a>, and came to think of this thread.

I think that would work well. And you've reminded me of something that I might do next time. I eased my group into the game by asking how their characters had met each other. That led into the introductory fight I described in 'The Core of the Rules' where we free-narrated one round of a fight. I think, next time, I'd do something like this:<br/><br/>* practice dice-rolling<br/>* describe how two characters met (usually that will involve a fight or something similar)<br/>* free narrate one round of a fight (to teach the initiative system)<br/>* play out a second round of the fight, but this time after players have described what they've done I can ask them to pick up dice for traits on their character sheet that seem to apply, and then have them roll those.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, I could go round the table doing this for pairs of characters, and it'd be kind of like Initiation scenes in Dogs in the Vineyard (in terms of teaching the rules through play).<br/><br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/buzz">@buzz</a>: Your 'the game is one big rule' is dead-on.

Not only did it introduce us to the whole dice pool aspect, but also helped the members of the party, none of whom have played it before, teach eachother in the order that we picked up what was going on, with certain shared aspects of the character sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401084/#Comment_401084" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T12:33:22+00:00" title="December 17, 2012 12:33PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/James_Fleming">@James_Fleming</a>: That group distinction sounds fascinating.

I think it adds to a sense of group cohesion too (That, and the fact that we all shared a group limit of 'Not ringfenced for SHIELD budget'). Our group of heroes was effectively a drop in support and liaison squad to give SHIELD a bit more of a global presence, but when the government started cracking down on their funding, our limit was effectively that we had to keep collateral low and conviction rates high, which was a really interesting twist on your regular heroes game.<br/><br/>When you share a distinction, the confused at the other side of the table can see a very similar dicepool on his sheet, and can probably parse out where it came from. I think that is really what I was trying to get at. It also helps improve group cohesion, and when the Limit falls it helps with the entire party realising exactly how those work with regards to their own, other, personal Limits.<br/>The one thing I think was hardest to do was the way that Team/Buddy/Solo and initiative worked, so that is probably something to focus on explaining to new players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401221">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401221/#Comment_401221" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-19T01:46:06+00:00" title="December 19, 2012  1:46AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for everyone's insights.
