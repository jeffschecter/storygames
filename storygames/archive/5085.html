Aidley's Together rocked me "double hard", because I too had been thinking a little of a "Massive Multiplayer Offline Tabletop Story-Game". It's a touch Guild Wars, a touch RPGA, a touch LEGO (when you look at how to build, deconstruct, and rebuild your character). It handles things like social and combat conflicts with the same system in kind of a do-it-yourself and still crunchy way.<br/><br/>BTW, you can find the G-C copy here:<br/><a href="http://game-chef.com/workshop/uploads/Together.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://game-chef.com/workshop/uploads/Together.pdf</a><br/><br/>Since I've been thinking about throwing down in the next two weeks over here in NC, I was wondering if Jack had done anything new with it?<br/><br/>Also, have you put any more thought into it, or thought about things that would best be changed?<br/><br/>Have you had a chance to run it?<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115010/#Comment_115010" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T09:10:54+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  9:10AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow. Nothing like being put on the spot is there?<br/><br/>No, I've not done anything with it; nor, to be honest, am I terribly likely to. There are other games in my head that I'm more interested in; and the truth is that I don't find very much time to work on games these days.<br/><br/>Mechanically, it works - more or less. The tests we did were fun, but not exceptional. It's a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, mechanically equal but freestyled character design (very much inspired by Capes) is a big fave of mine as is Character Change as more significant than Character advancement. To be honest I think each of the systems, ideas and features in it needs a good shake down and putting back together in a more coherent and well realised form. Another game I was working on which shares some features with it, <a href="http://www.jackaidley.co.uk/SupersHollow.pdf" rel="nofollow">Supers Hollow</a> (highly incomplete doc) did it better but has flaws of its own.<br/><br/>Conceptually? I'm less sure. The basic flaw is that in order to strip it down so that characters can be freely swapped between any game I took away all the bits that make it really interesting to play in the world. You're basically floating free with no long term aims, goals or solutions. An unstable world is, I think, ultimately an uninteresting world. Perhaps an Amber-esque infinite series of worlds would form a better backdrop to the style of gaming.<br/><br/>I'm very keen on "Open" games still, but I think the sweet spot for them probably lies in a "group" of about 12 to 20 itinerant players than in attempting to push the concept out further.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115820/#Comment_115820" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T08:14:43+00:00" title="December 21, 2007  8:14AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jack: Thanks for playing along! I got to say, there were some ideas in Together that really grabbed my skull, as I had been weighing them in other projects. Namely the MM-Tabletop/"RPGA/Living ____" aspect, and the "change, not fat xp" aspects.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jack Aidley</cite>There are other games in my head that I'm more interested in; and the truth is that I don't find very much time to work on games these days.</blockquote>\nI totally hear that, too. Thanks for putting as much into it in G-C last year as you did!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jack Aidley</cite>The basic flaw is that in order to strip it down so that characters can be freely swapped between any game I took away all the bits that make it really interesting to play in the world.

Actually, I found it very much like an Everway variant: An Everway variant that has definite stability in your pp-descriptions of the twelve worlds (while providing enough variance to let any GM or group "make it theirs").<br/><br/>If I end up doing anything with it, I'll let you know!<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
