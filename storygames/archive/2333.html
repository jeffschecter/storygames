                    OK, so I have this idea that I am very excited about.  I want to build a game called Medical Hospital, which will be all about medicine.  And hospitals.  The core conceit is that it will be composed of, say, ten minigames - the surgery minigame, the romance minigame, the political minigame, the trauma minigame, the diagnostic minigame, whatever.  They will be modular and extensible and use the same systems and currency.  So players can combine the comedy/romance/diagnostic to run a light, fast Scrubs analog, or surgery/trauma/drama/politics to run a more serious game, or throw them all in the mix for a weird melange.  Maybe there is a supernatural minigame to run Kingdom Hospital/Riget.  Whatever suits the mood and tastes of the group - more minigames means more complex sessions.  Some of the minigames will be explicitly RPG-like, and others will incorporate other elements.  So far I've only worked up the surgery and trauma games and tested them a bit.  In a vacuum they are a bit silly, but I have a feeling that once characters (the surgeon, his assistant, etc) are layered over the physical manipulations, they'll be gold.  <br/><br/>So the idea for the surgery minigame is that you are performing an actual procedure.  You have a letter-sized print out of your patient's guts with instructions.  Office supplies are your tools - scissors = scalpel, paper clips = hemostats and clamps, post-its = sponges, adhesive tape = sutures.  Each time you invoke a peripheral element (clamp, sponge, suture) as a surgeon, your assistant checks for complications, which may involve the patient's condition or may involve the surgeon's relationships somehow.  Still fuzzy on how this works, but it will tie into other minigames.  <br/><br/>Trauma is also fun - in this case, you use the same guts images, but actually rip, tear, or puncture them.  The surgeon is then timed as she debrides the wound, stops any bleeding, and patches it up.  Multiple injuries?  Teams of surgeons?  Multiple procedures?  Strictly awesome.  One of my tests is a brain tumor, which involves a craniotomy first to gain access to the brain.  My friend Joel suggested printing some procedures involving bones on heavy cardboard, requiring massive scissors or coping saws.  There is a lot of creativity possible in creating challenges.  <br/><br/><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/medical_hospital/images/" rel="nofollow">Here are some pictures</a> of my wife Autumn performing her first appendectomy, along with a largish .pdf of my test procedures.  One exciting thing is that there is a huge library of public domain medical imagery, so players will be able to create, remix, and share procedures.  Anyway, tell me what you think about this idea.                </div>

                            So are you setting standards for what has to be done in the procedure and some metric of how well you did?<br/><br/>Other than the huge amount of instructions for different sorts of procedures I think this is tres wizard.<br/><br/>Do you have a system for differential diagnosis? That tied with my life with master would produce house.<br/><br/>I want to see the human interaction stuff. this is very cool.                        </div>

                            Hey Thor, it's not too serious, in that I know nothing about medicine.  The procedures have about four steps each, and I'm not sure how they can effectively be evaluated for success or failure, or if they even need to be.  Random bad events will be introduced with every call for a clamp or suture, so difficulty of surgery can be measured and balanced at least.  The trauma game is a race against a stopwatch somehow - maybe different injuries are rated in seconds, and going over causes more complications, and going way over causes death.<br/><br/>There will definitely be a diagnosis game players can choose, although I have no idea how that will work yet.                        </div>

                            Jason, while in the shower, I was just thinking how cool it would be to have a game that was, in effect, about the history and discovery of modern medicine.  You could start in the late Renaissance, with humors and bloodletting and all that, and then progress through the beginnings of modern warfare (playing a medic in the American Civil War, say), Pastuer's introduction of germ theory and real vaccinations, and maybe stop with the discovery of antibiotics, like penicillin in 1928.  Just a thought.<br/><br/>Also, I didn't mean to kill your buzz.  Your game sounds totally rad.  Do it!                        </div>

                            When I eventually get mine, we'll surgery it up.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, I had the same sort of similar idea that you had here:basically a bunch of physically-oriented 'mini games' for use in some sort of shlock fantasy game. A gesture-based combat morale system, a posturing social/nobility mini-game... but literally that's as far as I got before being distracted by cheese.  So I think there's definitely room for physical mini-games.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Also, speaking of mini-game-based games, I had this outline of something way WAY back in the day, where you played out earth's first contact with aliens/angels (this was before I saw Evangelion, even), the effort to understand them, and the eventual conflict.  The game played out over several decades and you took on different roles in each session of play and played by completely different rules each time.  Let me see if I can dig it up to post in a new thread...<br/><br/>EDIT: Found it, but not enough of the rules to make a separate post (those were probably jotted down on paper somewhere).  Here's the outline of the game:
<blockquote>SERAPHIM &amp; CHERUBIM<br/>A Soft SF Mini-Campaign for Fudge<br/><br/>Introduction: Soft Futures<br/>Part 1: The New Space Race (Diplomacy/Strategy)<br/>Part 2: The Journey (Live Action)<br/>Part 3: Fighting Blind (Combat)<br/>Part 4: Seraphim Project (Traditional Roleplaying)<br/>Part 5: The War in Heaven (Live Action/Combat)<br/>Conclusion: The Pearly Gates</blockquote>
This isn't quite what you're talking about though, since here the mini-games are mapped out and have a particular order.  I imagine your medical game more like <i>House on Haunted Hill</i>, where the house is the person you're attended too.  There can be a bunch of different things wrong with them and, depending on what the problem is, there's a different mini-game that you have to perform in order to fix them up.  And you could do the <i>House</i> thing and have a separate diagnostic game where you try to figure out what the problem is and maybe you'd have to try a several different types of treatment in the hope of saving their life before they die or are permanently injured.                        </div>

                            Ka-ching!  <br/><br/>That's cool, J. Walton, and I want to play that, especially the part where you get up from the table, strap on your fucking guns, and run outside to kill some aliens in the bushes behind Mom's house.  <br/><br/>Here's what I'm imagining:  If you want the medical mystery thing, there will be mini-games that support that (diagnosis and drama, probably).  If you want a hospital comedy, same same (romance and comedy, probably with diagnosis or surgery added).  Drama in the E.R is good (Trauma, drama, maybe romance and diagnosis).  The bits will fit together in ways that can emulate all sorts of medical-themed entertainment.  I'm just spinning right now, since I don't have any of this, you know, <i>written</i>, but it seems like a good approach and potentially a lot of fun.  <br/><br/>This idea came to me, BTW, while reading<i> Ode to Kirihito.</i> </div>

                            We call those <i>craniotomies </i>here at Medical Hospital, and they aren't for letting out evil spirits.  Usually.  Which reminds me of another thing that excited me about the surgery/trauma minigames at least - fun as it might be, it's a teaching game.  It teaches anatomy.

                            Yeah, that's what I dug about the "history of medicine" idea too.  Maybe it can be a mod.  Also, I have associates who did Fulbrights on using traditional Chinese medicine (i.e. herbs and acupuncture) to treat cancer and AIDS (often combined with Western medicine too).  How cool would it be if you could play things like that in the game, with a little hacking?  Or if you could hack it to play a shaman or faith healer?  Finish this game already, Jason, so I can write supplements for it.                        </div>

Where's JBR?  He's still fermenting the Box of Minigames idear, if I recall correctly.  <br/><br/>As to differential diagnosis: one player describes the symptoms of the patient.  All physicians suggest a hypothesis.  The illness gets a buncha currency.  Everyone takes turns to "prove" a diagnosis - describe what you do to prove the diagnosis, get a complication to your proof, roll d6.  Subtract that much from the currency.  If the malady is broke, diagnosis is correct, move to Treatment.  Otherwise, complicate the malady and pass the turn to your left.<br/><br/>For House, run diagnosis long scale, and players much choose a diagnosis turn or a relationships turn.                        </div>

In hearing about this, I want there to be some serious requirements for making the surgery go well.  I know you were just saying to Thor that you do think there's any way to evaluate the well-done-ness of the surgery, but I wonder...<br/><br/>Like, what qualifies as "clamped," what's a good incision, what's well-sewn look like?  Maybe a little rubric for after surgery... so there's a timer because short surgery is good, and each "Scalpel.  Scalpel" exchange is a mechanical in the moment roll, and then the rubric for afters.  So you want to get all of the tumor, and you need to be able to reach the appendix, and you want to completely suture and sponge the injury, but each "sponge, sponge" is another complication role.  ( I can see it now: A: "Scalpel" B: rolls dice. "Scalpel.  So, doctor, you know that your ex-wife called, right?") And you want to do it all quickly.<br/><br/>It's way overblown to want a sheet of paper as the abdominal wall that you have to actually make incisions in and then work through, right?  <br/><br/>The more I think about this idea Jason, the more I'm looking forward to it.                        </div>

                            A rubric would be nice but difficult - I'm not sure how you assess the quality of somebody's paper-and-scissors work.  My hope is that their can be pressure/incentive to "do a better job", which means more complications.  Maybe each procedure has a minimum number of things, and then a suggested number.  If you do the minimum, it negatively impacts other minigames, like the political one.  I'd planned a timing element for trauma, and I can easily see a join where the quick-and-dirty debride/patch job of trauma is then "sent up for surgery" and a more detailed job must be done, complicated by the previous crude work.  <br/><br/>BattleLore pretty much sets the bar for instructional design, so that'll be something to take a hard look at.  <br/><br/>And Daniel, you know the inevitable scene where the surgeon is at the scene of a disaster without the correct tools?  In play you have to rip the procedure sheet with your bare hands, ever so gently, and use weird stuff like binder clips for clamps and so forth.  Maybe "No tools!" is its own minigame.                        </div>

<p>talk about parallel development... I had been thinking over the last day or two about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2242&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">this comment I made about creating a medical drama RPG</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>... although I haven't played Tony Lower-Basch's Capes, I read up a little about it and like the Click and Lock method of character creation, particularly the part about crossing out and replacing one item on each half of the character for quick customization. It's clearly evolved from D&amp;D's race and class system, but makes things quicker, and has potential for other applications. Like: what if you combine "medical condition" and "personal situation" halves to create a conflict for a Medical Center/St. Elsewhere-style game?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Of course, it's not really parallel at all, since the main feature of <em>Medical Hospital</em> seems to be the minigames, and maybe a little verisimilitude? (At least, that's what the idea of cutting out parts of a 2d organ suggests to me.) Whereas my game idea focuses only on creation of medical drama conflicts, then resolving them.</p>
<p>I was thinking about asking people for some brainstorming help, but I'll save that for a later day and another thread. Carry on with the minigames!</p>

Now I'm just imagining being at the hardware store or the supermarket with your fellow-players and suddenly one of them whips out a cross-section of a lung and says 'Emergency Procedure! Collapsed lung in aisle seven! Go!'                        </div>

I'm sure I read that thread and it must have been in the back of my mind.<br/><br/>Daniel, I'd love to set it up in a way that encouraged players to have a tray full of office supplies - three different sizes of scissors, two colors of post-it, three sizes of paper clip - all of which had some advantage or something.  I'd really like to arrange it so that players could invent new procedures and uses for, say, toothpicks and bendy straws, then share them with other groups.                        </div>

                            Jason--<br/><br/>This is just a neat idea and seems like a natural extension of what was going on in Business Solutions.  One of the staples of medical drama shows is that medical complications lead to personal complications--that the medical complication creates a stretch of time in which the characters must reflect and respond to the complication, often with the assistance of other characters.  <br/><br/>I think if you could make that switch back work in play (medical complication, let me get some help, getting help creates romantic/political/what have you problems, get back to patient, fix problem or repeat), then it would be wicked cool.  <br/><br/>I really think that there is something important, though, in the interweaving of the minigames, so that you start one minigame, but can't complete it without mixing in elements from the other minigames.  so that you don't just play the surgery minigame then the romantic minigame, but play the surgery game as the driving engine of the other minigames.                        </div>

                            That's a great observation, Ian.  I was definitely thinking of the games in series rather than parallel, because in my mind they will be very small and focused on a single conflict.  Some, like surgery and trauma, will be hard to "cut away" from because of the tactile components.  So it'd go like this:<br/><br/>Surgery minigame, which creates a relationship conflict, that requires...<br/>Romance minigame to resolve conflict, which leads to ...<br/>Politics minigame, which sort of lags and is tossed for ...<br/>Surgery minigame, which generates more conflicts and situation elements.<br/><br/>But these could all be interleaved between characters, since not everybody would have a dog in every fight.                        </div>

                            I've been thinking of the minigames as currency transformers.<br/><br/>Say I do a Surgery minigame, which gives me the opportunity to risk Status tokens to win Healing tokens. But what I want are Love tokens. So, I need to engage the Family minigame where I console a family about a loved one that just died, risking my Healing tokens for some Hope tokens. Then I can take the Hope tokens to the Romance minigame and try for some Love.<br/><br/>And, probably, there's more than one way to skin a cat, allowing for multiple minigame paths to various currency types.                        </div>

                            John for the win.  That'll be some sophisticated currency, but when it works it'll automatically generate compelling stories in play.  That's really cool.  <br/><br/>I'm thinking about using playing cards, which can provide currency in multiple ways.  So that ten of diamonds is useful in one game because it is numerically high, in another because it is in your character's suit (he's professional/positive), another because it is red (paging Contenders), and so forth.  So in this model you might choose to lose a conflict just to hold onto that card you'll need to woo Nurse Torvalds later on.                        </div>

                            Some thoughts on how to use cards in Medical Hospital.  Still not thinking about the currency.  The important thing is that the minigames are tied to scenes, and are very brief.  Card values vary wildly based on the minigame in play and a character's personal suit (this isn't fully baked).  Anyway:<br/><br/><b>CARD HANDLING AND RESOLUTION</b><br/><br/>Medical Hospital uses hands of seven cards.  There are three basic ways these cards can be used, and these methods vary by scene.  Players may retain cards, face down, from scene to scene, but they will always draw up to seven at the beginning of a new scene.  Whether freshly drawn cards are face up or face down will depend on the particular scene, but retained cards are always face down.<br/><br/>Each scene minigame ends after all seven cards have been exhausted, or a procedure has been completed, or a single conflict has been resolved by comparing hands.  <br/><br/>Retaining cards from scene to scene can make tactical sense, because specific cards and combinations will be a direct benefit in specific future minigames (retaining any three red cards, for example, makes all but the most complex surgery risk-free).  <br/><br/>There are three core games:  The color game, the sequence game, and the matching game.  Each has two variations.  <br/><br/><b>THE COLOR GAME</b><br/>Flip over cards at specific play junctures.  One color card has no effect, and the other color has a negative effect.  <br/><br/><b>Surgery</b><br/>Surgery minigame, you draw up to seven cards and the nurse flips one card every time you reach a junction in the procedure.  Red is good, black is a complication.  You can choose to draw from your "held" cards instead.  No single procedure can have more than seven junctions.  Multiple simultaneous procedures are possible.  Number cards are procedural/physical complications, and face cards are interpersonal complications guided by suit.  Aces are both.<br/><br/><b>Trauma</b><br/>Trauma minigame, you draw up to seven cards and the nurse flips one card immediately, and another card every ten seconds.  Black is good, red is a complication.  You can choose to draw from your "held" cards instead.  If surgery isn't finished in 60 seconds, the nurse adds an automatic physical complication every ten seconds.  Number cards are procedural/physical complications, and face cards are interpersonal complications guided by suit.  Aces are both.<br/><br/><b>THE SEQUENCE GAME</b><br/>Direct conflict between players.  Each puts forward a hand of two or more cards to resolve the conflict.  Cards in numeric sequence - regardless of suit - are added together.  A player without at least two cards in sequence automatically loses.

Face cards can be played prior to conflict resolution as "narrative points" somehow related to suit, and when played they are exchanged for a random card drawn from the deck.<br/><br/><b>Comedy</b><br/>The high total wins the conflict, making high-number cards valuable.<br/><br/><b>Drama</b><br/>The low total wins the conflict, making low-number cards valuable.<br/><br/>THE MATCHING GAME<br/>Card features - either suits or numbers and faces - are matched to determine the winner of a conflict.
