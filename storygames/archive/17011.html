Does it really only apply to the next time the <i>same</i> skill is rolled by the <i>same</i> character? In our game that meant Analysis Momentum never got used.<br/><br/>-During Operation, the PCs only roll directly against the Mook or the Boss if the Operational plan steps directly conflict with each other. This is no problem on the PC end, but it seems odd when the NPCs are attempting something the PCs didn't prepare for. What does the GM roll?<br/><br/>-Do Relationships break when the amount of stress <i>equals</i> the amount of points in the relationship, or when the amount of stress <i>exceeds</i> the value of the relationship?<br/><br/>-Relatedly, when Stress happens, whose sheet does it go on? The stressor or the stressee? Like, if Jacques is a Lifer and his girlfriend Amanda is a Civilian, and Jacques causes Amanda to witness something horrible, Jacques' relationship with Amanda, <i>on Jacques' sheet</i>, takes the stress... right?<br/><br/>Thanks.<br/><br/>Matt                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
