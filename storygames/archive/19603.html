Mostly I have been dissatisfied and my lack of clarity on my dissatisfaction was making it difficult to address the issue.  You have to first know what the issue is, after all.  I've played D&amp;D in lots of its incarnations over the years and there are things that I've enjoyed about the game.  As time went on I found myself disliking D&amp;D 3+, Pathfinder and even 4th Edition less and less but I couldn't really place my finger on the reason.  Then I had an epiphany while I was trying to create a character for a Pathfinder game.  I wasn't having a good time making the character.  It was like filling out my tax return... only more complex.  There were options upon options and classes and feats and skills and GAH!  I wanted to play but the rules of the game were actually becoming a hindrance in getting to the table and eating Cheetos and swilling Mountain Dew.<br/><br/>So I started poking around with other games.  I've gone all the way from the uber simplicity of The Pool, into FATE (in various incarnations) and other games that really streamline the rules and make character creation both fun and easy.  I love these games.  FATE is super-cool, by the way.  I tend to like Fantasy and Sci-Fi games so I took these games and started playing.  They certainly worked for getting me to the table with a minimum of fuss.  In fact, some of these games take character creation and make it a part of play at the table. (No surprise to folks around here.)  Bonus play!  However, after playing a while I was once again becoming dissatisfied.  I started to think a bit.  I liked the story mechanics and how the rules really brought out characterization in the game.  The problem seemed to revolve around the fact that mechanically playing one character felt the same as playing any other character.  Story-wise they didn't feel the same but mechanically they did.  Whether I was playing a swashbuckling acrobat or a mystic conjurer or a space fighter-jock, they all used the same mechanical process to do their "stuff".  The only thing different about them was what made it to the fiction.  The process into the fiction was the same every time.  I really wanted my characters to feel different mechanically if they occupied different "roles".<br/><br/>Now I know what you're thinking.  My desire for simplicity is at odds with my desire for uniqueness.  So what?  The two are in tension against one another, it's true.  I still think it is possible to hit a sweet spot somewhere.  My searching has recently led me in a couple of weird (maybe not so weird) directions.  First, I started playing True20 a bit and found I liked the game quite a bit.  Second, I stumbled into Basic Fantasy.  I did that while looking for a good game to teach my young son.  Basic Fantasy takes the old Red Box D&amp;D and makes the mechanics a lot more coherent.  I really, really have liked this game.<br/><br/>Whatever their faults these games seem to hit the sweet spot for me.  True20 mechanics are d20 but with a lot of cruft pulled out.  I can fit a character on a single sheet of paper without a small font or cramped handwriting.  Same with Basic Fantasy.  However, both make playing the different types of characters feel different on a mechanical level.  True20 has some story meta-mechanics like Virtues and Vices and Conviction, which I tend to turn up to 11 and make resemble FATE's Aspects and Fate Points.  Basic Fantasy deals with story but leaving it up to GM rulings.  I'm strangely okay with that these days.<br/><br/>That's a lot of rambling.  Not completely sure what I want in a discussion.  I kind of wondered if I'm alone in trying to scratch this particular itch of mine.  Also, both my choices are fantasy games essentially.  (I know True20 bills itself as generic but my results are very mixed.)  I'm wondering if there are similar games out there for Sci-Fi and other genres.                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435597/#Comment_435597" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T05:07:21+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  5:07AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I somewhat grok, though possibly in a slightly different way.<br/><br/>One of the things I LOVED about pre-3rd D&amp;D is how each class is so completely different from another. Not just in hit points, weapons &amp; armor, poison, oil, etc, but fundamental mechanical differences. Looking at 1st for example:<br/><br/>Cleric - Spellcaster, but no book, and can tank with the best of them. So uses D20 regularly in combat (but only blunt of course), AC matters, HP pool, spell mechanics, turning undead, etc.<br/><br/>Druid (once you add the expanded stuff at least) - Planeshopper, shapechanger, heavy immunities and counters, true neutrality, etc. So spellcasting, some d20 fighting, and lots of random abilities.<br/><br/>Fighter - I hit it with my sword...then I hit it again...all the while laughing at the measly damage dealt to me. Redundant, but different than others.<br/><br/>Paladin - LAWFUL GOOOOOOOOOOOOD! Ghost Hunter/Demon Slayer, numerous powers, etc. Some spells, strong combat, and so on. Heavy focus on save mechanics.<br/><br/>Ranger - 2 Hit dice at lvl 1??? What unique sorcery is this??? Druid AND MU spells? *boggle* Vaguely thief-like abilities in the wild, but done differently than a thief uses them. <br/><br/>MU - Different spellcasting entirely from Clerics/Druids. Reality altering glass cannon. Infinite utility...if you survive. If. <br/><br/>Illusionist - Ok, really never came into its own, and not that unique...mostly a creativity based MU with limited utility and targets.<br/><br/>Thief - Uses more % than d20. Gets to assign points at level up (at least with optional rules that became core in 2nd). Wide range of skills, especially once you add acrobat expansion. Burst DPS. <br/><br/>Assassin - Assassination table. What more do you need?<br/><br/>Monk - Mostly weaponless, super # of attacks, powers gained nearly every level, often uses high multiples of dice at once, etc.<br/><br/>Bard - Just the process for becoming one defies description, never mind the hodgepodge of abilities if you finally make it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Something I wrote a while ago analyzing things while 5th was in development jumps out at me here:<br/><br/> <i>Imagine a typical Fighter. He wears armor of some type, and uses various weapons, and is fairly tough. Now imagine four different people make a Fighter to play. One makes a tribal warrior, wearing natural armor, and using big two-handed weapons. The second makes a soldier called to the crusades by their God, wearing metal armor and using a sword and shield. The third makes a loner, wearing mixed armor and using hunting weapons like the bow, spear, and long knives. The final person makes a standard soldier, using various armor and weapons as they are found. Because there are no mechanical differences in those characters, they are all Fighters. Their power is all equally about combat. It\u2019s roleplaying, luck, and choices that differentiate them.<br/><br/>     Now imagine those four people roll up a Barbarian, a Paladin, a Ranger, and a Fighter to play. Suddenly it\u2019s a HUGE difference in party makeup. There are actual game mechanic differences. Suddenly a four Warrior group has access to three of the four lists of magic, magic items, as well as Thief tactics and exploits. They still interact with the world through brute force combat, but they do so as if they were more people than they actually are. The sub-classes are still roughly balanced against each other because of the granted abilities, but the party itself is vastly altered in its dynamics with the rest of the world. This is the difference between roleplaying/interactive differences and unique ability/mechanical differences.</i><br/><br/><br/><br/>Despite the crazy number of problems in the early editions you can't argue that each class isn't fundamentally different, and therefore drastically changes the interaction within the game. Even the dice you'll use, or what it means to level up (or how easy it is to do that) - entirely unique to each class. This total uniqueness of class is much missed by us in later editions. Unfortunately it fails utterly when it comes to the simplicity/logic of rules thing...though there's nothing complex about the characters like there is in 3rd with builds. <br/><br/>So on the one side I could argue that a true Class based system would solve the uniqueness of character thing somewhat by making each very different than the others to play. On the other hand, Skill based or build systems give each character the chance to at least appear different than every other, even if its only fluff and the mechanics are the same. <br/><br/>Likewise I would say that although the rules are generally messier and less organized/logical with a class based system, you also only have to really know the mechanics for the class you're playing (unless you're the DM) and the limited choices such a system offers makes it far quicker and easier than when you have so many options. <br/><br/>Sadly I can't offer much in the way of concrete game examples since most rpg design has gone in the opposite direction in my experience. If you ever find a game that has characters as unique as pre-3rd D&amp;D in a ruleset that isn't as borderline psychotic as AD&amp;D please let me know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435602/#Comment_435602" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T07:21:12+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  7:21AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2014 10:40AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sadly I can't offer much in the way of concrete game examples since most rpg design has gone in the opposite direction in my experience.

It's not quite as wild as AD&amp;D because it sticks closer to a baseline core system (so nothing quite analogous to thieves being the only ones to roll percentile), but the different "class gimmicks" are all fairly distinct, like sorcerers summon pets to fight or be bound into magic items (and can either spend time in-game and out- custom designing them or just roll randomly to see what shows up), mecha pilots basically get a double health track (one for them, one for their ride) and get escalating dice bonuses based on how in tune they are with their robot, ninja get their own set of magic shticks and can bank extra successes to use later, martial arts schools each have their own deals like "the counterattack school", the "fight with your empathy stat school", etc.  It's not class-based per se, but there's a "modular" variant on character creation where you can just spend build points on packages like "mech pilot", "aristocrat", "cyborg", etc so players can just pick one schtick to know about instead of reading through them all.<br/><br/>I really can't recommend the game enough, assuming you're cool with the hyper-stylized fantasy Japan theme (or are willing to reskin it away) and comfortable with some story-gamey narrative mechanics on top of your <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/394881#Comment_394881" rel="nofollow">"I roll thirty dice to hit him"</a> mega-combat (which I assume you are given where this thread is).

I noticed I hated un-efficient math earlier, though, since my previous D&amp;D GM used the game complexity to cheat players into railroading in the worst way. Then I started to stress out about making sense of the whole system and min-maxing my way into fun. I couldn't, so I turned into hacking other games to obtain what I wanted.<br/><br/>Now though I realize all that math is an effort to help simulation and that there are people to whom the numbers talk with beautiful music and even tell stories, I also have realized that I'm not one of them. <br/><br/>I hacked Anima Beyond Fantasy until it gave me a close vibe to Tenra Bansho. Then I hacked both of them together into what I thought was going to be my definitive game, but it ended up not being my group's game. Also, my obsession for simplicity kind of ended up making the game into some Fate, and even with different mechanics for every package, everything was reduced to rolling 3d6, keep highest and add something. It was fast, but not granular enough for anything.<br/><br/>I also saw true 20 and loved how they streamlined the system. I loved the simplicity of the classes and how feats make them unique. I couldn't go through the health mechanics though. I'm still thinking of hacking it.<br/><br/>And though at the beginning I was hating it, I gave it a chance to the last iteration of D&amp;D 5th and I was surprised at what it has become. I've even got to admit it feels better than True 20 to me now. Math can't be simpler, classes keep their mechanics different, feats are grouped to give your character more options into a particular flavor, instead of more bonuses. Backgrounds are a great way of making your character different but also provide it with a story. Maybe it's still missing a way to relate PCs to each other but so far it has convinced me into playing D&amp;D again as it is, instead of hacking it.<br/><br/>Still, my friend is so frustrated with the original Anima that he got me into hacking it again. Now I'm using 5th backgrounds, TBZ packages as backgrounds too, True 20 feats and all the rest is a skill based system. :P wish me luck.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435614/#Comment_435614" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T08:41:13+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  8:41AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hear you on universalized games feeling a little generic after awhile.

(Both in terms of his/her position in the world, but also in terms of theme and/or outlook.)<br/><br/>The fun part comes largely when you "level up" and transition to another playbook. That's when a character really takes on an unexpected shape, you know?<br/><br/>For example, my last AW character started out as the Quarantine (a military survivor from another era). He then developed the ability to heal people with his touch (a move from the Angel playbook), and rumours began circulating about why. Gradually, he transitioned to the Hocus playbook, becoming a religious leader, and struggling with the balance of firepower/might versus peace and protection.<br/><br/>This kind of thing is built into this approach to character creation: each "advance" leads you to reconsider the character a little.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435636/#Comment_435636" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T14:17:21+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  2:17PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gaerik, could you describe what you mean by "mechanically different" characters?  I've heard many players talk about liking that, but I don't understand what the key features are.  Once you separate out fictional differences, what's left?  Different dice mechanics?  Different system resources, like magic points to spend?  Are such things sufficient on their own, or are they means to some other desired end?<br/><br/>Apocalypse World and other mechanically similar games provide different character types with different fictional abilities that entail slightly different resolution methods, but many of those system differences are mostly about who says what when (player/GM), rather than spell lists for wizards or percentile skill rolls for thieves.  So AW-style games might be exactly what you want or not at all what you want, depending on the particulars of what you're hoping for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435669/#Comment_435669" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-22T21:10:47+00:00" title="July 22, 2014  9:10PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Sadly I can't offer much in the way of concrete game examples since most rpg design has gone in the opposite direction in my experience.

It's not quite as wild as AD&amp;D because it sticks closer to a baseline core system (so nothing quite analogous to thieves being the only ones to roll percentile), but the different "class gimmicks" are all fairly distinct, like sorcerers summon pets to fight or be bound into magic items (and can either spend time in-game and out- custom designing them or just roll randomly to see what shows up), mecha pilots basically get a double health track (one for them, one for their ride) and get escalating dice bonuses based on how in tune they are with their robot, ninja get their own set of magic shticks and can bank extra successes to use later, martial arts schools each have their own deals like "the counterattack school", the "fight with your empathy stat school", etc.  It's not class-based per se, but there's a "modular" variant on character creation where you can just spend build points on packages like "mech pilot", "aristocrat", "cyborg", etc so players can just pick one schtick to know about instead of reading through them all.<br/><br/>I really can't recommend the game enough, assuming you're cool with the hyper-stylized fantasy Japan theme (or are willing to reskin it away) and comfortable with some story-gamey narrative mechanics on top of your <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/394881#Comment_394881" rel="nofollow">"I roll thirty dice to hit him"</a> mega-combat (which I assume you are given where this thread is).

That game has four different factions and each faction <i>feels different to play</i>. One faction draws a lot of cards, one gets random resources, one hold cards and saves up for the final blow and one uses the opponent's cards to win. They do use the same basic mechanic, but the cards creates different thinking.<br/><br/>I miss that in roleplaying games. <b>Deadlands</b> had sort of it, where mages used cards and holy people paid poker chips to activate prayers. I tried to create a game where the main thing was to fight together in a huge space ship. The gunner either rolled to hit ships or stored the shots to deliver a major blow. The techmech had to gamble to gain more resources that others could spend. The captain divided the ship's resources to each ship to be used each turn. The hacker could lock the ship's resources into the shield or mess with the controls of other ships. What I wanted with this roleplaying game was to create something for everybody. Some people love gambling, so they could play the techmech, some people love destroying things so they could be the gunner, et c.<br/><br/>One thing I really liked with <b>D&amp;D4</b> was one of the class abilities for the warlock. They got +2 AC if they moved around and that made their fighting tactic to stand out, compared to the other classes where all had powers - sure, they did different things - but almost every power were handled in the same way (roll die, read effect).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435689/#Comment_435689" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-23T08:22:04+00:00" title="July 23, 2014  8:22AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I have not.

Both times I was kinda dissapointed that ruleswise I couldn't make too many daring moves until I earned the right feats to do it, also that my character would hit less and do less damage that the party fighter even when both went unarmed into combat, and that I would always have less AC than him.<br/><br/>But in Pathfinder I ended up learning that the monk is a different kind of character, it requires more strategy than a fighter, it has more options and he also has to use the tools available (caltrops, oil, etc) and the enviroment. It's like playing D&amp;D in HARD mode, if you want to be the striker. You're actually better in a support role, making hitting easier to other members of the party, taking down the magic user, ambushing the enemy and jumping back into the shadows. I still can't say I enjoyed every moment I played with the monk (I never got to grapple anything, the whole campaign the enemies were undead that I couldn't touch at lower levels, and monsters too big to grapple or non-humanoid at higher levels) but I had a few good moments and saved the whole party a couple of times because of my inmunities and other class tricks. But I definitely found out that it was a totally different way of playing the game.<br/><br/>I've got hight hopes for 5ed monk. So far it still looked squishy and normally does less damage than the fighter, but here and there he can peak his damage way over the fighter's, to hit good when it counts and then go back to being support with the rest of his class tricks.

I guess it depends on what you like about "thinking differently about the system".  <br/><br/>Personally, I enjoy when (e.g.) I'm playing an archer, and the system rewards me for thinking about (and optimizing) the sorts of concerns an archer would have.  Plenty of systems <i>acknowledge</i> relevant factors (AW games included) but don't reward me much for managing them (AW games included in that too) beyond meeting a "yes you can do it in the fiction" requirement.<br/><br/>In thinking about specific-concern-rewarding systems, it's easy for me to come up with Shadowrun deckers, Cyberpunk netrunners, and other special-rules character classes, but I dunno where your cut-off for rules bloat is, and most such games have plenty of mechanically identical classes too.<br/><br/>Deliverator's suggestions might be a nice in-between.  All Spellbound Kingdoms characters traverse an action grid to follow one move with another, but each class gets a different grid.  All Riddle of Steel characters roll the same dice in the same order to hit and damage, but auxiliary effects (and thus tactics which include them) differ by weapon type.<br/><br/>Barbarians of Lemuria is a pretty rules-lite game but also has really neat rules for wizards.  So there's at least two distinct flavors for ya (wizard &amp; non-wizard characters).<br/><br/>I might be able to come up with something better if you feel like elaborating further on what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435737/#Comment_435737" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-24T06:46:01+00:00" title="July 24, 2014  6:46AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I want to have to think differently about the system when playing different characters, not just the fiction.</blockquote>In that case, I would guess that Apocalypse World and similar games would not scratch that itch.</blockquote>\nI would say that only the hardholder does/creates anything different in AW.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435745/#Comment_435745" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-24T08:38:11+00:00" title="July 24, 2014  8:38AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll use Basic Fantasy as an example.  I'm kinda digging the dungeon-crawly, old schoolness of the game at the moment.<br/><br/>I decide the play a Fighter.  It's the basic class. It can't really do anything system-wise that the other classes can't.  It just does the swing-at-things-til-they-die thing better than the other.  So there is a certain feel to playing that class.<br/><br/>Later I play a Thief.  I can do the stuff the Fighter can do but isn't nearly as good at it.  Less hit-points, less weapons, less armor, etc.  But there's this whole Thief Skill sub-system that gets tacked on just for the Thief.  Plus, you get the Sneak Attack thing.  The sub-system isn't just the normal d20 roll thing either.  It's different.  All percentile based.  There's a certain shift in my mental space about how I interact with the mechanics.<br/><br/>Later I play a Mage.  Mage's can still do the stuff the Fighter does they just really, really suck at it. But they have this nifty magic sub-system that is only available to them.  Finding scrolls and scribing them.  Choosing spells. Very different kind of mental space there.<br/><br/>You get the idea I hope.  The sub-systems aren't really complicated.  Basic Fantasy is... well, basic.  It isn't a complicated game but it does make the different classes of character feel different mechanically.
