The weakness of XML or custom SGML is that you'd have to choose a document format that is interpretable by your delivery software of choice - so either that choice is XHTML so you can use the ubiquitous browser Ron mentioned, or you're back where you started with PDF files, needing a separate program for accessing the material.<br/><br/>(I hear wild legends of self-created custom XML document declarations that some browser might be able to understand, allowing you to invent your own XML markup and program its browser display as well. Maybe in the future.)<br/><br/>Other than that, I repeat my prophecy from the box thread: the games that benefit from long, living texts will become electronic in the future, with HTML being a quite strong and already well-supported format, while short, solid games will benefit from more productization, becoming like boardgames. Books will continue to be the delivery format of choice for a certain subset of the audience for practical or aesthetic reasons, but their production will become a specialized sidenote - the electronic form will come first, and books will be spinned from that format by various means ideally light on labor. So in that sense I support Ron's claim of "should": we indeed should start writing our books with the primary attention on electronic publication; this will allow us to leverage the full benefits of the electronic medium while causing a negligible impact on our book production capabilities. Already a smart workflow will make producing a book almost trivial after a a correctly typed electronic text is in existence.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/brehaut" title="brehaut"><img alt="brehaut" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://media.brehaut.net/"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/brehaut">brehaut</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243993/#Comment_243993" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-27T15:33:26+00:00" title="November 27, 2009  3:33PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Leveraging client side databases in HTML (such as HTML5's Web Storage spec or google gears) to allow the players to annotate their own copies with new parapraphs, notes, cross references, etc would be a killer feature.

If you can't afford an ebook to read the html on, <i>or</i> any other computer, <i>or</i> the printed book version printed from the digital file, <i>or</i> a sheaf of paper to print/copy the text on yourself, then you shouldn't be able to <i>buy</i> (not play, note) a game text. Likewise, I'm firmly in the camp that if you can't write HTML, <i>or</i> use an authoring software like Microsoft Word, <i>or</i> pay somebody to type your text into a computer, you shouldn't be able to write a RPG intended for mass release.<br/><br/>All instances of "should" in the above should of course be read as expectations on my part. If anybody manages to confound these expectations, do let me know - Jonathan Walton has speculated about orally transmitted roleplaying games, I think, but aside from that I've yet to see any ideas for how to avoid selling game texts in textual form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244149/#Comment_244149" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T14:43:33+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  2:43PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim - Have you seen the price of books lately?<br/><br/>Although what I really should have said was all RPGs should *also* be available in html.

Opening pdf files is much slower, much processing power is spent on emulating legacy functionality for paper reproduction purposes, layouts are limited to paper-like concerns and reformatting the material for different purposes is nigh impossible. These are not major concerns for occasional computer users who do in fact benefit from the strengths of pdf files, but for power users they are deal-breakers. I've myself experienced the phenomenon where I idly click on some moderately interesting thing on the net and actually cancel the operation when I see the computer go into pdf opening sequence - I often don't have the time and the patience to have the computer torture itself with a pdf file like that. It's a clear usability threshold compared to html or other immediately browser-interpreted formats.<br/><br/>The deeper, long-term benefits come from the superior flexibility and usability interfaces that text formats (including HTML) offer. Copying text from the file never becomes an issue, screen size of the end-user is not a problem, updating the material is trivial, transforming the entire file into something else (such as pdf) is a one-click process and so on. The workflow is simply simpler and more robust, although admittedly we achieve this by losing much of the paper-publishing functionality that pdfs offer, such as total typographical control and such. I estimate that these losses will weight less in the future as people get used to the information processing point of view: as IT professionals already know, data and its presentation are two different things, and greatest powers are available only when we manage to separate them and flexibly repurpose the presentations to always be optimal for current needs and purposes. This viewpoint is still foreign to the majority population, but I expect that the benefits will trickle down in time and make abandoning the pdf paradigm in digital publication all the more alluring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244241/#Comment_244241" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T10:06:41+00:00" title="November 30, 2009 10:06AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can HTML be read on ebook readers (Kindle etc.)?<br/><br/>To me it seems clear that the ebook reader will merge back with the computer pretty quickly so this may not be an issue for long if it is an issue at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244246/#Comment_244246" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T10:43:14+00:00" title="November 30, 2009 10:43AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the great challenges facing traditional RPGs not based on licensed properties is how to enable an enthusiast and prospective GM to hook the interest of players.

If I drop my backpack, or it gets stolen, or I spill a soda, or I want to hand it to someone else for a couple days to read through, a paper book is better for ALL those situations; I'm only out the one work, and maybe not even then, as books can take certain kinds of trauma better than electronic equipment, and not my entire library. But having more than oen version availabl for different situations, that's so clearly a viable idea that it's being adopted pretty universally across the industry without a lot of hand-wringing or hard pushing.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244249/#Comment_244249" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T10:52:48+00:00" title="November 30, 2009 10:52AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a neat idea, Paul.

Good copy is always important to engage readers regardless of the format, but game books written as novels aren't very useful as games.

One path through this sort of design is to come up with a fairly robust and wide-ranging set of targets, and see how various choices would work in building them.<br/><br/>I can only think of three basic notions at the moment, though.<br/><br/>1) Something like a single page HTML file. Very simple. Very limited, but still useful. (There are some "variations" to this idea, such as a very simple ebook format or something, but basically any rendering where the result is a long stream that doesn't particularly worry about page breaks, display size and so on.)<br/><br/>2) The obvious rendering into a PDF book. Harder than it sounds because the author may care a lot about certain text appearing on a certain page (or, sidebar X being on the same page as rule Y, and so on). (I haven't used XHTML in a while, but my recollection is that its notions of pagination sucked.)<br/><br/>3) Something like a "hypertext reference database", where the data is split into small "entries" tightly linked together. The result might be a directory of linked HTML files, a .chm file, or a more advanced type of ebook. (I doubt XHTML would be very good at anything but the most rudimentary form of this. Take a game like Spirit of the Century, for example. In a real reference system, you might want to treat, say, a section of text that describes a Stunt as being distinct from some other type of section, allowing you to process Stunts in some special way. Without some very hacky tricks, one div tag in XHTML would be basically the same as another.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244329/#Comment_244329" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T06:03:18+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  6:03AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So the skill set to publish games moves on.<br/><br/>One of the challenges in publishing is learning the skills to do it (or you are at the mercy of someone with the skills). Since I've been gaming (1976) the skill set has changed three or four times. With the constant move forward of technology that will only continue and speed up. There comes a point where you stop trying to be leading edge and pick and choose from what has been made easy and use that. I don't think that is Ludditism (I don't mind if the world plows on ahead of me) it's just a recognition that I could spend all my time learning the newest XML or I can make my games (in my case PDF off of Adobi products). <br/><br/>I've very interested in ebook readers and how they will work but I'm unimpressed by the Kindle.

I read a lot more stuff online than I used to and have come to enjoy the advantages of reading online.  I downloaded the Kindle app for my iPhone because it was free and there were some free books I could use to try it out.  I was sure I would hate reading a book on my phone, but I wanted to use actual evidence to support my diatribes on why reading books on a phone was a stupid idea.  Instead I found that I love it and have proceeded to read several more books on my phone.  (I am troubled with the way Amazon monetizes ebooks, though, but that's another topic.  I also have an irrational love of collecting physical books and I wish publishers of novels would do what some game publishers do, where you get an electronic version with the purchase of the physical text.  Crap, I'm going way off topic...)<br/><br/>The way I read reference books (what game books essentially are) is very different from the way I read novels, though.  I could see doing an initial read through of a game book on the iPhone, but then to refer back to it, I'd want a bigger screen, more ready access to the index and table of contents.  For me, I think the various markup languages that already exist are fine for displaying the electronic versions of such books, but I don't think the device exists yet, at the price point that would make it reasonable, to make me want an electronic version at the gaming table rather than a print version.  (I already own a laptop, and the price-point issue isn't such a problem because the laptop does so many other things that it's not just an expensive ebook reader, but I don't like that a laptop doesn't lay flat when it's open.  Yes, there are tablet PCs, but I'm a die-hard Apple fanboy...)  I think I would need something like the Kindle DX, but color, and with a touchscreen.  While I'm at it, I would make it so it opened up book-style, so it had two screens, so I could always have an index open on one screen and read text on the other.  I'd like this to cost about $100.  Please let me know when this is ready.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244353/#Comment_244353" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T07:52:37+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  7:52AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The device you describe costs something like $1500 at this point (at least with digital paper; probably much cheaper with a traditional display), John, so there's still some ways to go.

There's absolutely nothing you can do to copy protect HTML (SGML, XML) without some kind of hardware dongle and (crackable) client-side scripting.<br/><br/>At least PDFs can be sold with Passwords To Open, which will give you an audit trail once they hit the file sharing sites (assuming you provide a unique password per sale).<br/><br/>Annnnd, I know this is an aside that's not totally relevant: many projects don't care about profit or the protection of same. When I have free/CC project, I DO put them <a href="http://davidartman.com/design" rel="nofollow">in HTML</a>.<br/>-----<br/>It is entirely possible to deliver HTML with all the graphical "zing" of a printed book, folks--that's a dead-end objection. One might not be able to do so with Totally valid, Proper, Approved, Structured, Transitional HTML (4.0), but one can do so with Hacked, Table-Formatted, Fix-Scaled, Semi-Scripted HTML. And that HTML can even be made to print on a page neatly (it can! I SEEN it, up in the hills! I SWEAR!). Or you can do all the XML(DTD) -&gt; XSL -&gt; HTML/PDF/MSHelp/Kindle/etc/etc pipeline. With the click of a button, once you have it setup (you can! I SEEN it, up in the hills! I SWEAR!).<br/><br/>Problem is, most of the infrastructure to do that easily (i.e. not you hand-coding cranks with your LaTeX--you boobs! (pun intended)) costs thousands of dollars in software and setup time (and testing). Unless you find a bunch of volunteers, free open source software, and patient print providers. I've never found more than one of those three, in my experience....                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244425/#Comment_244425" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T13:20:26+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  1:20PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All sorts of things can be done, David, but I don't that that we should be singing the praises of systems that are still clearly incomplete - let's rather be realistic and confess that while HTML (XML, whatever) can do all sorts of amazing things, doing those things is at this point the domain of expert web programmers and not any sort of reliable routine. Also, I don't think that HTML can do "the same things a book does" broadly speaking, the gulf in publishing traditions is just too great. I invite anybody who thinks otherwise to try to create a bog-normal tabulated list in both HTML and a normal layout software. It makes much more sense to treat the screen as an entirely new medium, rather - it can do amazing things, but those things won't map 1:1 on things that have been done on paper in the past, and we'll all have less in the way of desperate annoyance ahead of us if we don't insist on aping the paper layout in what we do on the screen.<br/><br/>As for the lack of protections in HTML, I guess I don't see that as a problem due to how I don't see a future in copy protected culture industry in the first place. I wouldn't place any bets on which will be the first to go, the paper book or the whole concept of paying for content. Whichever it is, the other one won't be far beyond. I see the window of opportunity in digital paid content to be so narrow that anybody trying for it as anything but a transitional thing will probably be sorely disappointed. Better to hone up our publishing models into something that can withstand universal piracy and eroding public perception for the justification of copyrights.

I am confident that I could, with not too much trouble, layout any RPG you care to name, in HTML, page-by-page perfect. (Whether or not aping the print medium is worthwhile is neither here nor there--it all depends on the customer's priorities.) Perhaps I am more skilled than the average bear, but I could even *hand-code* that, not using anything but a good text editor and FTP. If I am allowed other DTP tools, especially those with pixel-precise layout paradigms, I could do it a bit faster, for sure.<br/><br/>But the thing is: If I start with a dedicated *print* DTP package, I can not only deliver a PDF (or PS) to my print provider, I can ALSO (with maybe some post-production) deliver an HTML version. And a high-functionality PDF for screen use (assuming I can use Acrobat), with a different page layout template and some mouse clicks. AND I could push out to plain text (for old-school eReaders or "bare bones" rules for reference/searching).<br/><br/>Point being--the file format is sort of irrelevant to aesthetics. It IS relevant to delivery channel(s), usability, integration with other tools (e.g. a character database built from filling out a PDF form), and protection. Ron's OP is mainly (it seems) focused on usability.<br/><br/>I'd also claim that I can replicate any kind of vanilla HTML site (i.e. not heavily scripted) in a PDF. Recall that PDF--being predominantly vector-based--scales to fit a screen (or a page) very nicely, whereas I've not used a browser that does so, for all sites (but, yes, one can build a site to do "full window scale" with the right markup). That's another plus in its column, compared to HTML.<br/><br/>Conversely, why deliver anything remotely approaching print format, online? An "HTML RPG" should include (at the least) all sorts of character or situation generation tools, cookie (or HTML 5!!!) client-side data storage (e.g. those generated characters), Fortune mechanics tools, state maintenance and update functionality, etc, etc, (i.e. whatever common "rolls" and "notations" and "statuses" the game uses). HTML's interactivity, especially with scripting, is a couple or orders of magnitude more functional than just 'make it searchable and cross-referenced with hyperlinks.' AND, if you use the full spec, you can even make it print out mostly like you'd want it to, for a print provider (I'll admit I'm rusty on all those print controls, beyond placing page breaks so lines don't get clipped by dumb RIP engines).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Better to hone up our publishing models into something that can withstand universal piracy and eroding public perception for the justification of copyrights. Trying to prevent piracy becomes less profitable every day.</blockquote>And that's why I was worried about derailing--protection and medium are linked, BUT discussion of an ideal medium for <i>presentation</i> of RPG content is orthogonal to protection.

Looking at it from the viewpoint of complete projects, it's not enough to know HTML; you also need CSS, Javascript and probably a bit of server-side programming and databases for a modern website. That's not a small skillset. Learning about typography, right workflows, color management and all that not a small thing either, of course, but then I wouldn't characterize either of these domains small - they're both so deep and wide that you can get into them as deep as you ever wish.

As Chris noted in passing up above, one reason for why PDF is so attractive to many publishers is that it allows them to leverage their existing skills in the digital world instead of having to learn it all over again.

I taught myself HTML in an afternoon, and I've spent ten years perfecting that skill, along with other web technologies. But the time it takes to learn and the time it takes to master really mean two very different things. Even the most basic skills can fill a lifetime of practice for further mastery. As a barrier to entry, though, we have to ask how much skill it takes to get started, not how much skill it takes to become the best or do it professionally.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Just like you can make a website and publish it with just basic HTML skills, you can make a book with Microsoft Word; I would consider those pretty similar in difficulty.</blockquote>\nI would agree, those seem of roughly equal difficulty.
