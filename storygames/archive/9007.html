I'll just jump straight into the thought I had, based on playing too much Resident Evil 5, Persona and Pixeljunk Monsters lately.<br/><br/>These games are very tactical, especially on higher difficulties. When you die in the game and get that game over screen, it sucks... and yet, it's awesome, because you know exactly what you're going to see: If you replay that encounter, the enemies appear and act in pretty much the same way, so you can prepare differently, try different equipment or tactics, make better use of the playing field, etc. Get better at the encounter, rather than the encounter being packed up and shut away if you fail.<br/><br/>Some thoughts, based on console RPG conventions:<br/>*If a character totally dies but the others survive, the "dying" character is left with 1 HP and no XP for the encounter, even if he defeated like half the enemies before he went down.<br/>(note, this wouldn't work in EoD, where character death works differently, but would for 4e I think).<br/><br/>*If there's a TPK: Game Over. The players can either decide to leave it at that (and roll up new characters), or to replay the encounter. If they replay it, *the GM changes nothing*. No weaker monsters, "stupid" tactics, etc. He plays hard again, but the players, knowing what to expect, can plan differently. In 4e of EoD, this would represent manuvering in new ways, using the landscape, knowing where likely stronger NPCs are so they can be addressed tactically, etc. In doing so, maybe a penalty is imposed: The players get less XP (half?) if they make it through, or fewer items/treasure.<br/><br/>*If there's something in the middle (some characters fall, others survive) the players can take a unanimous vote to replay the encounter from the start. But at some kind of penalty.<br/><br/>I wouldn't want to use this in a game without a lot of tactical depth to it (like L5R, Shadowrun, CoC, etc: Stand toe to toe and trade blows until one falls; or roll attacks and dodges with high dice, little terrain/tactical effects, again until one side falls). This idea is more for games with some sort of tactics and strategy, where redoing an encounter means more planning/strategy than "hoping for higher die rolls/luck this time around".<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199071/#Comment_199071" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T08:36:56+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  8:36AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And if the players then fail to complete the fight on the second try without a TPK, maybe they could just say "it happened" and get no XP and are all at 1 HP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199083/#Comment_199083" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T09:12:24+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  9:12AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark Causey</cite>And if the players then fail to complete the fight on the second try without a TPK, maybe they could just say "it happened" and get no XP and are all at 1 HP.</blockquote>\nI dunno. I think the third try maybe the GM should scale back like one element to make it slightly easier (not on the second try, though: That's all tactics, but without editing Anything, having the players rely on tactics more), because the encounter might have been built incorrectly (or the players could be like, "Shit, I fucked up on my tactics the second time through: OK, hit us again, same strength, I think we can get it this time").<br/><br/>I dunno about "it happened", though.  If the GM had the thought of "well, if it's a TPK all the players are going to get captured by the militia and held for a few days", then that can happen (maybe it can happen even on the first try: "Sorry, no retries: They take you captive. It's ok, I planned in case the story went this way"). Otherwise, in the case of a "we kill them or they kill all us" (monster in a dungeon, etc) then there is no "it happened": You either get through it, or you legitimately accept a TPK.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199085/#Comment_199085" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T09:19:22+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  9:19AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/>Some thoughts, based on console RPG conventions:<br/>*If a character totally dies but the others survive, the "dying" character is left with 1 HP and no XP for the encounter, even if he defeated like half the enemies before he went down.<br/>(note, this wouldn't work in EoD, where character death works differently, but would for 4e I think).</blockquote>\n4th edition has a lot of albeit quite advice, that the players should be kept at the same level and sometimes even the same Xp total, something a lot (a few? i don't know) of people have been doing since 3rd at least. In addition it would require the gm to remember the entire previous encounter while running it again, something that may or may not work. (if the gm does something different with his or her monsters are they making it harder, are they mollycoddling). <br/><br/>Also Dnd in general already has the 'Game Over: Continue 10' screen with death and resurrection magic. <br/><br/>I think it would take some buy in, Like you said of a serious nature. If anyone ever asked me after a tpk I was in, if I wanted to 'retry' it or 'go to save' they would be mocked relentlessly where I come from, and quite possibly a few other places (could be considered deprotagonization because it devalues players choices that lead to death, because hey save spot) It really seems to be a way of putting story before characters as apposed to emphasising extra planning/strategy. (Reminds me of old nintendo games where you could do that because the stunts they wanted you to do were essentially random. Run off a cliff and press the botton exactly at the right time or fall to your doom kinda thing. Its frustrating. <br/><br/>However, if you want to take the idea and apply it something like in Penny Arcade throw away joke, each death or rezz could litterlly place you on a new plane. After you die you go to the negaverse and battle with the negamonsters for negatreasure to get back home, etc. However after the nega verse it could be the shadow shadow do dadow plane which is probbably more of the joke they were getting at. <br/><br/>(Althought it would be awesome to die and then wake up in scary town)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199086/#Comment_199086" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T09:29:50+00:00" title="March 27, 2009  9:29AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the idea of a play-over where you've learned a little, but I think that in a game like 4e that would be really tedious and time-consuming.  <i>Especially </i>for the "I can change nothing" GM.

As written, it's pretty much TPK-proof.  FPS video games were a big inspiration and one of the things that I noticed is that you never really *die* in those games, the game just smacks you on the wrist and says "you suck and did not stand up to my challenge!"  Of course this pisses you off and makes you more determined to take another shot at whatever the challenge was.  The permanent injuries in EoD are meant to be the slap on the wrist (that pisses you off without taking your character from you) and the defeat table is specifically set-up to help you work a "re-do" into the fiction (without having the feeling that the GM is just remorsefully holding your hand after his NPCs stomped you). In practice, many of the "you get captured" results tend to play out exactly like a "re-do" because you skip past the boring shit and pick up when the PCs have a chance to escape (which usually involves a running fight with the same or similar opponents).  I guess the difference is that it's worked into the fiction rather than being totally "meta."  <br/><br/>On a related side-note.  Years ago I played in a friend's Rifts game where he used "save points" that we could go back to if we didn't like the way things turned out.  He ended up abandoning the idea after he realized that the game lost a lot of its mystery and tension (we would have missed out on so much cool stuff that came from "negative" events).  Of course, that game was more heavily centered on exploration.  I think the idea is much more viable in a tactically focused game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199101/#Comment_199101" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T10:27:11+00:00" title="March 27, 2009 10:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Logos7</cite><br/>However, if you want to take the idea and apply it something like in Penny Arcade throw away joke, each death or rezz could litterlly place you on a new plane.

A group of brave (well, actually not-so-brave) adventurers would go into the dungeon, and sooner or later they would either a) all die, or b) retreat to the town with whatever was left of the party. In either case, then new characters were rolled for anyone who had died, those new characters were hired as mercenaries by the remaining "adventurers" and the group would enter the dungeon again.<br/><br/>I don't recall anyone ever making it to second level, so there weren't any issues of "character balance" (there's very little "balance" in a 'roll 3d6 for each stat' game anyway, except that everyone's pretty unlikely to survive for too long). <br/><br/>What made it interesting, however, is that stuff would *change* while the group retreated to the town. Some other group of people was quickly removing treasure from the dungeon in some way (I didn't get to find out, but the other players knew about it), meaning that each such "reset" meant fewer potential gains. Monsters that had been routed from parts of the dungeon might reclaim territory, or even arm themselves with weapons left behind by dead adventurers.<br/><br/>This dynamic was fun--the new group would go in with a sketchy map of what they remembered from "last time", if there had been any survivors--but, of course, Red Box D&amp;D has a very different type of tactical environment, and part of the appeal is that encounters can be played out VERY quickly.<br/><br/>All that said, I feel like replaying an encounter over again in any game *exactly the same way* sounds like a bit of bore, at least for the GM. I feel it would be far more interesting to play things out again <i>with a twist</i>. After all, the players now know what to expect, have an idea of the opposition's strengths and weaknesses, etc. They are going to adjust their tactics and try to take advantage of the situation. I think it would be far more interesting if *the opposition did the same*. They, too, would adjust their tactics for the "second match". That way, there is some interest and some surprise in it for everybody. <br/><br/>I think that in most games, the successful side (in this case, the DM/GM) has less incentive to modify their tactics anyway. On top of that, it's more work for the GM/DM to do so, especially in the middle of a session. So, I think the overall dynamic of the players being the drivers of change in tactics would still be there. But I like the option for the GM/DM to throw in a twist.<br/><br/>Note, also, that the Red Box D&amp;D-style "roll up new characters, face the dungeon again" is different in that the players may choose to face the same encounter once more, but <i>don't have to</i>. They can try another branch of the tunnel and try to get at the treasure another way.<br/><br/>Could the only choice being to replay the exact same encounter be a bit of bore? It seems that there should be other options, at the very least.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199201/#Comment_199201" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-28T09:36:10+00:00" title="March 28, 2009  9:36AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In a third edition game I ran we had the "Trial and Error Experience system".  It was a solo game, so the small party (one PC plus one NPC sidekick) threw off the difficulty estimates of the system.  It was also a <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/variant/classes/gestaltCharacters.htm" rel="nofollow">gestalt game</a> (basically each character had two classes that advanced together), which threw off the difficulty estimates int he other direction.  Consequently, we never had any idea if a given encounter would be really, really easy or really, really hard.<br/><br/><br/>So the system went like this: every time the main PC died, we reset to just before the encounter <i>and the PC went up a level</i>.  Then we tried it again.  Dying by levelling was in fact the only way to go up in level, so I as GM tried to make encounters extra difficult, but not impossible by any means.  so the PC dying and levelling happened about 5 (?) times over the course of the game.  The new abilities and new tactics meant the second time through the encounter went a lot better for the PC.<br/><br/>After some iterations of this, we built in story reasons for how it happened.  One explanation used a little bit was stolen from <i>Lone wolf and Cub</i>: the PC would imagine the fight in her head, and see how it could go wrong.  So she'd do something different (the second version of the fight, which became true in game).  Later on, the deaths turned out to be alternate timelines, and the PC's survival was tied to having an Epic Destiny.  She couldn't die before fulfilling her big purpose, you see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199202/#Comment_199202" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-28T09:38:33+00:00" title="March 28, 2009  9:38AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>Could the only choice being to replay the exact same encounter be a bit of bore?
