IMHO i think that (maybe expect for scandinavian countries) withtout translating games to local european languages, there will be no "take off" of these kind of games among german rpg gamers, and beyond.<br/><br/>Two years ago, it was the same situation in france. Geek gamers are still buying games in english but the audience now for these kind of games here, while still small, has been growing exponentially with all the translations. <br/><br/>It seems that germany hasn't began his "indy" take off, while italy seems at the forehead in europe. Back in the mid 80's, Das Schwarze Auge was my very first RPG (and still one of my favorite: we've published Donjon with this one in mind, not D&amp;D!). I just had the chance to discover RPG because, thanks to Gallimard (a very big editor), you could find this game in almost all the book shops (even in supermarkets)<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://img516.imageshack.us/img516/3933/1003048ww2.jpg"/><br/><br/>I just can't wait to see small publishers in germany interested in translating storygames/indy games. When they will spead throught german-speaking country, i'm pretty sure there would be soon a very active and creative scene (ie : as the US scene)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Herman_Duyker" title="Herman_Duyker"><img alt="Herman_Duyker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.starstonedesign.com/mt/img/stealth.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Herman_Duyker">Herman_Duyker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395544/#Comment_395544" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T04:46:33+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  4:46AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2012 8:44AM by Herman_Duyker.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know of many indie publishers / designers in the Netherlands, and/or in the Dutch language.<br/><br/>There is Queeste (translates surprisingly into something like "Quest" in English, first started in 1979, and apparently still going), <a href="http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/queeste" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lulu.com/spotlight/queeste</a> and <a href="http://queeste.ijlbode.nl/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://queeste.ijlbode.nl/</a> (in Dutch), though it seems to have moved to be more of a public domain thing nowadays.

It seems that Das Schwarze Auge is in some way the european equivalent of D&amp;D. I don't know about how it came to be so popular. Maybe it reached a big fame in germany and then, it was easier for european publishers. In france, we had 2 versions, one from Gallimard, and one from Schmidt, who maye have introduce the game first outside germany.\n<blockquote>The Dark Eye still is the big thing in Germany.

It's not a critic, i like it this way.

During the 90s, the german boardgame scene, through the eurogames, made possible the "democratization" of boargames, and the market vitality we know today. One of the key for that what a new kind of game design. I think in many ways, the eurogames design was going exactly the opposite way to RPG in these time:<br/>-  Complex vs Complicated<br/>- Focusing on gaming  vs focusing on thematic. <br/>- Wider market VS shrinking market. <br/><br/>This could explain a lot of things.<br/><br/>Now, Eurogame design (german /european legacy) + strong thematic could be the right equation for a european storygaming scene. Check the success of Legenden von Andor<br/><br/><a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/127398/legends-of-andor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/127398/legends-of-andor</a><br/><br/>it's still a cooperative boargame close the Shadow of Camelot, but with much more "extensive use of text", while being a family game in the tradition of light eurogames. It's not a Storygame, as there isn't creative input, but i feel we're not so far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_395576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/395576/#Comment_395576" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-31T09:54:30+00:00" title="October 31, 2012  9:54AM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed a friend of mine has got Legends of Andor thing, I will need to play it soon.<br/>Recognized authors also would allow to market limited roleplaying products. Usually it seems like publishers want to establish a franchise. But if there are known authors that deliver good games it could be sold on their names. Like for example Greg Stolze is a well known name in the english speaking scene.<br/><br/>The Dark Eye started as a D&amp;D clone in the 80s, but they kept developing the world over almost 30 years. It took a little while to introduces the background and get it all started but now it is one of the deepest backgrounds around. Comparable maybe to Glorantha or Song of Ice and Fire. Many german players who are into indie games really dislike it, saying it goes into too much detail. That aside it really is impressive as a body of work. There is a bi monthly "newspaper"/magazine with news from the world of Aventuria. There are big campaigns detailing world changing events. If you are willing to get into it and maybe approach it a bit like a series of fantasy stories or a daily soap that makes it rather enjoyable. You start to care for some of the factions in the world and all that. They are getting better with providing room for the players to change the world too. <br/>Still when you are getting into the Dark Eye you are buying the metaplot and the background as well, that is the defining aspect. A valuable skill is to know what to use and what to leave out for your own campaign, where to put the emphasis and what details to use.<br/>The setting began rather kitchen sink like, a bit like Pathfinder's, where you can travel into "genres". Aventuria has genre regions as well and you can usually play characters from there by clichee and get the right idea. The viking like guys are like vikings and the renaissance ideas in the civilised region aren't too different from historical ones. Dwarfs, Orcs and Elves all work like you imagine them by clichee. But there always is a deeper layer of background, with different Orc and Dwarf cultures and all that. Points where the clichee is broken. But you only need to go there when it touches your campaign.<br/><br/>Here are the overview maps <a href="http://www.dasschwarzeauge.de/fileadmin/downloads/offiziell/Das%20Schwarze%20Auge%20Kartenpaket.zip" rel="nofollow">http://www.dasschwarzeauge.de/fileadmin/downloads/offiziell/Das%20Schwarze%20Auge%20Kartenpaket.zip</a> of Aventuria.

A kind of "renaissance fair at the gaming table"-style of roleplaying. It has established the notion of the GM as a storytelling guide in its truest sense, taking the players along for a ride and presenting this "magical realm of Aventurien" to them with its ongoing storylines and decade-long history. <br/><br/>This in turn led to different expectations and desires when it came to playing indie or non-traditional RPGs among German gamers. On the one hand, you have "traditional" German gamers who care most about new and different settings and backgrounds to delve into and experience through a storytelling guide. On the other hand, you have people who like to tinker with rules and game concepts, but don't have this strong motivation to focus on narratives and having their adventures be *about* something the way many English-speaking indie gamers seem to.<br/><br/>And while I think the main reason why there are relatively few indie games translated into German, is purely economic; I also think that gamers with the means to get a game translated and published, don't really see much overlap between German gaming sensibilities and most indie games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
