Though I'm confused on the last sentence there. Do you mean we should all be familiar with all the above four?  Or should we post about more than one? Or is just one cool?<br/><br/>I'm going to post on just one for now, with the caveat that I'm totally not trying to sell people on it:<br/><br/><b>With Great Power</b><br/><b>Neat Stuff: </b><br/>* a pacing mechanic for the story, that basically forces the characters to lose a lot before they really start to succeed, and that pacing mechanic is represented by a sheet of paper.<br/>* "Love for Mary Jane" can be just as powerful, if not more (if the player wants it), as "Webslinging/Spidey Sense/Super Strength/Super Dexterity/Wbslinging/etc"<br/><br/><b>Good for: </b><br/>* Games with no GM secrets: The GM has to have scenes which showcase the enemies to make them powerful.<br/>* Players who are open to play roles other than their character: There is definite character ownership, but the game pretty much makes the players ALSO get involved in other character's scenes as anchors, antagonists, random NPCs, etc. There isn't the "all NPCs controlled by GM" effect.<br/>* Stories focused on those aspects of the PCs that the players want brought into play.  If the GM runs a game where the big bad is just some random dude who must be stopped, or where people are finding it hard to relate to the baddie, then the GM didn't read the book or setup correctly.<br/><br/><b>Avoid for:</b><br/>* Games where the "big plan" needs to be a secret from the PCs.<br/>* Games where the players want to play their character, and don't want to play-act other random NPCs as much.<br/>* If the players don't like card-based resolution. Cause there's a lot of fucking cards in play. I love the game and yet it sometimes gets annoying to track them all.<br/>* when you really want to know how muxh your character can lift. I'm not being facetious here in the "Oh, because knowing that is so blase, and this gets past all that drivel...". But honestly, I'm running a WGP game right now which is hot as fuck. And yet, I know now that I want to run another supers game within the next year using another system, because I do want to do the whole "character building/see how much they can lift and how powerful they are In Numbers" thing.<br/>* Groups where it's often the case that a player or two can't make it here and there. Pretty much everyone has to be on board the whole time, otherwise the story changes without that person's input, and missing one week means that they show up to a game where so much shit went down they don't know how to fit in anymore.<br/><br/><b>Other Concerns</b><br/>I haven't made an AP about my ongoing With Great Power: The Night Watch - Seattle game (which Matthew Gandy and Quintin Stone here are in), but a few things that it took me a while to get around with this game:<br/>* Antagonists need scenes, too. I had maybe 2 antagonist scenes in 4 sessions.<br/>* Make the players roleplay the roles of major NPCs, don't take them on all yourself as the GM.  The first scene where the PCs' boss enters, I made the conscious choice to hand this role to one of the other players rather than play him myself as the GM (and gave the descriptors: "He's a large man, he's very powerful. He seems nice and reassuring, to new agents and to old hats. He's black, and he always wears a three-piece suit. Go!"). Magic happens when you do this. If the GM takes on all the NPCs, he will be talking to himself a lot, while 1-2 players sit there on their hands.<br/>* The main thing: DON'T RUSH TO CARDS. Give the players their roles, let them roleplay, dammit!  Only step in when it's apparent that something needs to be resolved. Bask in the conversation that unfolds, don't sit there with sweaty hands ready to jump into the roleplaying, and break it up screaming "OK! Conflict! Let's Go!".  My players have fucking astounded me in this campaign with their in-game in-character roleplaying, and as a GM I've been really nervous, like "Shit, I should be rolling dice or something now. Instead, I'm just sitting here not doing shit while the players talk to each other in character. I have to force a conflict now!" and getting past that nervousness is the first step to running an awesome WGP game. Not doing so means that you're pushing the game along without care to how the roleplaying is unfolding. <br/><br/>I love WGP, but only for specific modes of play. I was lucky this time around. Next supers game I play will probably be T&amp;J or H&amp;S, just to play some supers in another mode.<br/><br/>Also, I suggest you think about adding the recent Marvel Supers (with "Stones") to the pile, as you can find them on eBay for cheap, and as JD Corley demonstrated, it was a very overlooked game with a lot of coolness brimming under the surface.<br/><br/>Does that help, man?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92677/#Comment_92677" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T20:49:54+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  8:49PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2007 8:50PM by chadu.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            TonyLB did a great breakdown of at least three of these games in one post on RPGnet, but I cannot seem to find the URL...<br/><br/>Tony, do you have it handy?<br/><br/>(Short form: they all do different things awesomely.)<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92681/#Comment_92681" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T21:12:53+00:00" title="September  2, 2007  9:12PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy: your post is on the money, and I clarified my post to say what I meant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_92694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92694/#Comment_92694" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-02T23:56:07+00:00" title="September  2, 2007 11:56PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dev,<br/><br/>Is there a reason Mutants &amp; Masterminds isn't on your list?

Firstly, I like to keep my before game prep minimal (preferably zero), which this sure didn't support in any way. Secondly, the campaign really dealt with issues that weren't supported (Cold War superspies, focus on trust and paranoia). So, very good for certain modes - if my spies had been cast more as James Bond types, I think it would have worked great.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_92844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/92844/#Comment_92844" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-03T19:19:57+00:00" title="September  3, 2007  7:19PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heroes Forever RPG<br/>\n<br/>\nNeat Stuff: <br/>\n- Uses and expanded version of the D12 results table resolution system first introduced in the Dark Realms RPG (every and all die related resolution is resolved using a D12 and that table)<br/>\n- Point based system that lets players mix and match most any crazy set of skills and powers.<br/>\n- "Class Levels" which let the system represent supers and creatures of any power. Each class level represents a x10 factor to all powers, attacks, defense, etc. So while you average low powered Hero is a class one, some of the most potent DC style characters would run class 3 or 4. But the scale system keeps going up and one NPC detailed was a Class 12.<br/>\n- The "background" setting for the game system assumes that Supers and Immortals have been around since the dawn of time and as such, it is a completely alternate history setting.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood for: <br/>\n- Games that intergrate Magic, Super powers and ubber tech.<br/>\n- Playing supers adventures at both the mundane and world shaker power levels.<br/>\n- Also uses the Personality rules from the Dark Realms RPG, thusly rewarding character development &amp; interaction (ala, rewards the role playing of the role playing game and encourages players to continue develope the personality of their character further)<br/>\n- Taking an oddball setting and plugging in powers at any level into the mix and still havng it make sense and not destroy<br/>\n<br/>\nAvoid for:<br/>\n- Fast to no Game Master prep time. NPC and creatures can take a while to develop using this system.<br/>\n- Fails to balance mixed class level characters well into the same campaign. Class levels 2 &amp; 3 can interact ok, 3 &amp; 4 also, but Class Level 1 characters will have a tough time taking a single hit from Class Level 2 and above NPCs.<br/>\n-  Core game rules were designed to be low cost and provide game system and base powers only, so it fails to deliver the depth or cool factor of the alternate history setting the game is based on.<br/>\n- Needs to have a quick gen accessory to make picking and stating out NPCs on the fly quick and easy for the game master.<br/>\n<br/>\nFailings of the core system we are looking to "fix" through expanded materials:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Put out an "World Atlas" book that case serve to show the plenty of maps and highlight the settings alternate history and give game masters and players ideas on how to take the skeleton of the setting and really make it their own.<br/>\n- The "techie" type characters (ala, a Batman) really need a book dedicated to them, with tons of options at stuff they can use. Bruce already has the Billionaires handbook printed up, but it has to go through binding yet.<br/>\n- I need to make a NPC quick gen accessory set of some kind and get it out there cheap. Then pile on lots of accessible NPCs in each world and setting sourebook we do.<br/>\n- I think we're going to have to dedicate a book to supers with mental powers. They have some cool and powerful powers in the core rules and in some ways, the lack of other support materials make them both extremely powerful (ie, some of the strongest and most powerful supers might not also have mental defenses) but also big targets and fairly one dimensional characters. More options, lesser powers in that arena and some additional methods to get said characters involved in the traditional "physical" slug fests are needed.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.

The approach when I wrote it was for a fairly traditional system, but cut down to make things relatively simple and fast, in play and particularly in chargen. Andy K did a great review of the first edition over at RPGnet. 2nd ed tightened it up a bit and improved the layout a lot. Dice pools, d6, success counting, pick a mythic "Source" which acts as a "shopping list" of available powers, point buy at 1, 2 or 3 points each.<br><br>And yes, it does also exist as the first licensed supplement for Truth &amp; Justice. At this point, with hindsight, I think T&amp;J is probably a better fit in many ways, although Original Ed does have a lot of good mechanical ideas for that style of system (and has developed into the rules in Albion and the cut-down NUGGET rules that have spawned their own line of minigames.)                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93198/#Comment_93198" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-05T11:31:28+00:00" title="September  5, 2007 11:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Capes</b><br><br><i>Neat Stuff:</i> Click-N-Lock Modules for Chargen: Powers plus Personality, customize, Go!
