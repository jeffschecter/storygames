(And how superheroes seem to be a thing that people see as a challenge to "get right" in gaming.)<br/>\n<br/>\nquestion:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. How many of you guys ever had or wanted to write a fan fiction for an established character, worked up a 'script pitch,' or treatment, or 'reboot' concept for an established character?<br/>\n<br/>\n1a. When you're playing a character in a game, do you feel like a big part of the enjoyment is "getting that character right," making sure he is "in character" according to the core concept either in the media (if it's an established character) or your original invention (if you rolled your own.)<br/>\n<br/>\n1b. Do you, if you have done (or daydreamed about) this kind of writing, see a relation between, lets say, the appeal of "doing the X-men right" in a spec script or fan fiction, and the appeal of playing an X-character in a game?<br/>\n<br/>\n(also been thinking about the sides of the coin of the importance of playing to character vs. the old-schoolly "your character is the guy who did what he did")                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365131/#Comment_365131" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T17:35:41+00:00" title="March  4, 2012  5:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We imagined writing slash fic about our Bliss Stage characters.

Sherlock Holmes fanficcers were writing fanfic <i>before Doyle was done writing Sherlock Holmes stories</i>.  In this respect, when I played Sherlock Holmes in an online game, I was less trying to get Holmes "right" as I was trying to express my own personal take on a very iconic character.<br/><br/>Iconic characters are broadly drawn - they often use stereotypes or broad classifications to get across their essence.  Sherlock Holmes stories don't form a deeply thought out psychological portrait of a character - there's a reason there's a shitload of Sherlock Holmes fanfic and (virtually) no Hyacinth Robinson fanfic.  Sherlock Holmes can be more effectively made "my own".  The whole reason I am attracted to these properties is because I want to give my own take, my own version of the character. <br/><br/>It isn't that I'm trying to be true to some Platonic ideal of the X-Men universe - that doesn't exist.  At various times in the history of the X-Men they have conversed like over-wordy adults pretending to be hip kids, suicidal jerkoffs, and whatever kind of robot excretes Joss Whedon dialogue.  There is no "center" to the portrayal, there's nothing to get "right".  Instead, there are very broadly drawn characters: a power, an appearance (this is important) and a general personality trait. These make for very simple levers that a creator can casually twist and pull to put in situations of interest to them. <br/><br/>So no, I don't feel that "getting a character right" is of that much interest - instead, what is of interest is expressing/developing a character, preferably through action, but if not through action, then through dialogue.  I do a lot of design-in-play, I'm one of the few in my group that does.<br/><br/>1b - I definitely see a strong connection between playing an established character in a game and writing fanfiction - in fact, the vast majority of the roleplaying hobby is basically doing just that, minus the game part, in play-by-forum and play-by-email games.  Empirically speaking, this is actually the center of the roleplaying hobby, just by dint of numbers.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Figaro" title="Figaro"><img alt="Figaro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Figaro">Figaro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365380/#Comment_365380" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T17:06:09+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  5:06PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ corley "I do a lot of design-in-play, I'm one of the few in my group that does." what do you mean by that? mostly in the sense of "what are you doing that most of the others in your group aren't?"<br/>\n<br/>\n"Empirically speaking, this is actually the center of the roleplaying hobby, just by dint of numbers" obviously this is huge. the audience overlap with the games that aren't "minus the game part" doesn't seem well observed to me and maybe i'm just missing it. related to what i originally asked though.<br/>\n<br/>\n@ Marshall "Never done fanfic, but I used to write short stories a lot, and a few incomplete novels." do you have a take on 1a, 1b?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Figaro" title="Figaro"><img alt="Figaro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Figaro">Figaro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365381/#Comment_365381" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T17:08:25+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  5:08PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ corley<br/>\n<br/>\nalso. re : "The whole reason I am attracted to these properties is because I want to give my own take, my own version of the character."<br/>\n<br/>\ni think this is closer to what i'm imagining as "getting the character right" than a chimerical "platonic ideal" of the character being "right"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365386/#Comment_365386" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T17:22:17+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  5:22PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just speaking of comics, since they're multiply authored and (these days) rebooted all the damn time, I think most comic fans accept that there are different versions of their favorites.  The arguments are about which one was best, or most faithful to the Golden Age Urgestalt of the character, or which one was most badass.  <br><br>Personally, I find that people who argue a lot about being true to characters can make difficult gaming buddies, because they stop the flow of the specific game to hold out for some ideal vision that doesn't mean anything to me.  That's why I like to play in games that, if not wholly original, at least have a different name and a new coat of paint.  That way, if I decide that my version of Wolverine (who is named something different) is less annoying than the official Wolverine, nobody can complain about it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365387/#Comment_365387" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T17:23:53+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  5:23PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Figaro</cite>"I do a lot of design-in-play, I'm one of the few in my group that does." what do you mean by that? mostly in the sense of "what are you doing that most of the others in your group aren't?"</blockquote>\nMeaning: I like to have a few solid concepts, a few broad strokes, then I start playing, and I work out the rest of the character in response to the situations we're in.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Figaro</cite>i think this is closer to what i'm imagining as "getting the character right" than a chimerical "platonic ideal" of the character being "right"</blockquote>\nSure, but there's no value judgment involved - it's just my character, not necessarily the "right" version of the character.

If you search topics for "spectre of the mushroom kingdom" it will be right there.<br><br>So, what that thread is, is a scenario created by me and played by Joel and friends. It came about because I read Wicked and played Mario 3 in the same day. At first I was like, I could write this, but then I decided that was silly (I never really "got" fanfic, no offense meant to anyone), I should make it a roleplaying scenario instead. I didn't have enough people to cover all the characters, so I presented it as a "Play This! Challenge" on SG.<br><br>What I wanted to do with it was retain everything about the characters that made them who they were, then fill that out with a third dimension of human motives that cast a new and interesting light on the situation, such that issues of who was the hero and who was the villain were totally up for grabs.<br><br>It was important to me that Bowser be totally recognizable as Bowser, with all the traits that make him Bowser, even as his war against the mushrooms is recast as a struggle for independent sovereignty, and his thing with Peach being recast as desire springing from genuine respect. The same goes for the other characters, and the way that Joel and company handled it was pretty much ideal.<br/><br/>It's not so much a matter of getting the character "right" as it was a matter of seeing whether I could add literary depth to something as silly and two-dimensional as Mario, and of seeing how far I could bend the material without breaking it. It therefore becomes a creative challenge, and quite rewarding if you can pull it off, even (especially?) by proxy.<br/><br/>Sorry if I'm vague; I'm typing from a phone, and it's hard to be eloquent when you can only type at one-tenth your speed of thought.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365392/#Comment_365392" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T17:33:01+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  5:33PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recognize that urge, Marshall.

I can't think of an example from gaming, but Spider Man, in the Spider Man films, is not Spider Man to me... there's just a number of little things that are changed that cause Spidey's spideyness to go missing. I liked the movies and I liked all their Sam Raimi goodness, but they were missing something that was essential to my experience of the character. So, if I was gaming with pre-existing characters, I'd try my best to get the group's breaking points down, to try and discover when something was just to far removed from their conception of the character to fit into that conception. This happens to me a lot with settings. Star Wars gaming has routinely failed in my group because people don't respect what kind of content fits within everyone's idea of Star Wars and what kind of content fits just within their's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365445/#Comment_365445" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T22:27:58+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 10:27PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think when I was but a boy and a beardless youth, I was deeply concerned with "getting it right", this is something you do see in fandom roleplay a lot - elaborately detailed character descriptions/pictures/music/etc.  These days I'm more able to see the characters as creations (in comics, joint creations over many years), and appreciate them on that level.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
