It really doesn't work at all if there's no tension between *both* your duty and your innermost self *and* the shit you need to take care of. Likewise there needs to be tension between your innermost nature and both your duty and your responsibility. And of course, your responsibility versus your group duty and your natural inclinations. [/quote]<br/>\n<br/>\nFor my group, Beliefs have always been a bit troublesome. Players sometimes have a difficult time coming up with them, and the GM (usually me!) sometimes has a difficult time challenging them (partly due to the players creating beliefs that are difficult to challenge). [side note: this may also be due to the fact that we are all new to this system!]<br/>\n<br/>\nUnlike Instincts and Goals, there is little framework for creating Beliefs. This is both a good thing and a bad thing. Instincts have the If/Then statement framework which makes it easy for players to create them and even easier for GMs to bring them into play (just introduce the "IF"). Goals have to be framed around the main goal of the mission, so there is at least something to reference to when creating it. Beliefs are open-ended.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was considering placing some restrictions on creating Beliefs. I was thinking of making players create beliefs tied to a group of people. This could be an entire society or culture, town, organization, or family. But it has to be a group of people. This modification would make them more "cultural ideals" than personal beliefs, but my justifications are as follows:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. With a clearer focus, it may be easier to come up with them. (similar to the "if/then" statements...this could be "As a member of (group), I believe X")<br/>\n2. Now, the GM can bring in the group to challenge the player in some way (whether its putting the group in danger, introducing rivals to the group, or still challenging the ideal itself).<br/>\n3. It adds a new dynamic to things:<br/>\n<br/>\nInstincts/Nature: responsibilities to yourself<br/>\nRelationships: responsibilities to another individual<br/>\nGoals: responsibilities to your adventuring group<br/>\nBeliefs: responsibilities to society itself (or any large group of people as a whole)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe downside is that it does constrict beliefs a bit more.<br/>\n<br/>\nAny thoughts? Opinions?<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n[edit: And I can't seem to get the Quote to work.....]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Esoteric" title="Esoteric"><img alt="Esoteric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Esoteric">Esoteric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352743/#Comment_352743" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-29T14:13:22+00:00" title="December 29, 2011  2:13PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2011 2:14PM by Esoteric.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play around with "Format comments as" to get the quotes right.

So do that! It's good. Just make sure everyone's on the same page and playing by the same rules.<br/><br/>I don't super-duper love how Beliefs are implemented in MG because I find them hard to evaluate as a GM. When you're coming up with Belief constraints, I'd think about that from the GM's POV.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352785/#Comment_352785" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-30T06:22:47+00:00" title="December 30, 2011  6:22AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The point of MG beliefs is to serve as a moral compass for your character, it is the character's guiding light:\n<ul>\n<li>Reason is the best guide to right action</li>\n<li>The only good predator is a dead predator</li>\n<li>The best solution to any problem is to be found at the tip of my sword</li>\n<li>The Guard exists to serve the people, never the other way around</li>\n</ul>\nAs a GM, you can look to them for inspiration for obstacles in missions. <br/><br/>If you've got a player with the reason belief, make sure to throw in situations where people are acting emotionally rather than reasonably. At the end of the sample Deliver the Mail mission, Martin the carpenter is desperate to retrieve his grandmother's rocking chair from the ruins of Walnutpeck, now deep in Weasel territory, so he can give it to his daughter as a wedding present. He wants the help of the Guard. What does a Guard mouse with the reason belief do in that situation?<br/><br/>If you've got a player with the predator belief, make sure to involve dangerous predators. What does a character with this belief do if the mission is to help a community fortify itself from depredation by a fox, or worse yet a bear? Trying to kill the predator will require a War conflict and will probably lead to a lot of dead mice. <br/><br/>I know I'm on the right track with a situation when I look at a character's belief and think: "Huh, I wonder what the character will do in <i>this</i> situation?"<br/><br/>All that said, don't fret too much. Try to challenge the beliefs of one or two mice per session. Let the rest of the players shoulder the responsibility for bringing their beliefs into play.  It's really easy for them if they try. Once a player has a few sessions under his belt, I have zero sympathy for him if he complains he had no opportunity to express his belief in play. All you have to do is perform an action that reflects your belief. You can pull it off with a single check if you need to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
