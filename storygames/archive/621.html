                    In the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=617&amp;page=1#Item_15" rel="nofollow">Serious Games</a> thread, Jason was talking about the idea of designing games to use for serious purposes, such as training skills. He expressed an opinion that RPG designers could do this very well. I've got to admit, I'm not sure. I don't know how well game design skills would translate to designing training exercises.<br/>
<br/>
Could we test this? For example, how would you design a game to train negotiation skills? How about the skill of giving a presentation? How about sales skills?<br/>

                            Do you have a model of good negotiating skills in mind? <br><br>This is going to be a very serious case of system matters. <br><br>1. Find the actions you want to reenforce and how those things change the situation.<br/><br/>2. Ditto those actions you want to eliminate. <br/><br/>find a reward system that is not intrusive to the dialog, but provides positive actions with something the negotiator wants. <br/><br/>develop a system whereby the other side of the negotiation has the tools to provide conflicts that are both realistic and broad enough to test the skills. <br/><br/>include a reflection period where both sides talk about the encounter. double up on the reward system here so that the participants are encouraged tofigure out what they did wrong for themselves. <br/><br/>this is just off the top of my head based on stuff I did when I was a manager.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Joshua, yes, interesting. Drills are very similar, except they teach roleplaying skills, and I'd be aiming at business skills.<br/>
<br/>
Tony, that's interesting. I imagine Capes does teach negotiation. But could you, say, send managers on a training course, get them to play Capes and, at the end, they'd say: OK, now I can go back to work and negotiate? At the very least, I think you'd have to play a version of Capes adapted to focus on negotiation.<br/>
<br/>
Thor, that sounds a bit dull. Could you make it more fun?<br/>
<br/>
And I'm not sure you do need a negotiating system in mind. What if we worked out a roleplaying game based on the aftermath of a war, where we had to work out a peace treaty? That would get people to negotiate, without teaching them a negotiating process.<br/>

                            Grahm - of course it could be made more interesting , but first it needs to be the right model. <br/><br/>af6ter the model is checked the game can be overlayed with whatever you think would be fun. If the underlying reinforcement model isn't there you could be reinforcing thinngs which would not be beneficial.                        </div>

<p>Graham:  It depends on what sort of negotiation you want them to learn.  Capes will teach them that conflict is not something to fear, but can be productive.  That means that they will be more ready to embrace a conflict and to search for a way to resolve it.</p>
<p>Will it make them any better at actually resolving those conflicts?  I tend to think so ... I tend to think, in fact, that much of the problem of conflict resolution (particularly in the workplace) is that people look around for somebody to <em>blame</em> for the conflict, because they assume it's a bad, sinful, painful thing that could never, ever happen between reasonable, passionate, invested people.  Learning to discard that misconception helps you negotiate.</p>
<p>Now if you want to <em>teach</em> them to avoid conflict, to take the blame themselves (e.g. "I should never have let it reach this point") and to view conflict as something toxic, a disease to be treated (e.g. "Let's all just calm down here ... make sure things don't get worse, then we can talk about making them better") then <em>Capes</em> will not help.  In fact, it will make anyone who plays it <em>markedly</em> less open to that method of negotiation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think that latter one is what companies want to teach their managers, because (though it doesn't solve conflicts) it reinforces the manager's position of authority.</p>
<p>Sidenote:  A lot of teaching has to do with the context that you're teaching in, and specifically why people are coming to learn.  You could <em>totally</em> make an RPG that helped people with addiction problems to better learn how to recognize warning signs in their own patterns of behavior ... but would a player who had been ordered to play such a game by his boss at work be willing to invest?</p>

                            Graham:<br/><br/>It's very hard to get people to spontaneously reinvent the wheel, so to speak.  Yes, you can make a game that will teach people to (for example) negotiate - and that game can be anything from "Now move this piece around the board and memorize the negotiating rules as you go" to a brilliantly-designed system that supports the development of expertise.  But just saying that people will do it, and then they'll automatically get better at it, isn't really supported by educational research and theory.  The number one way to develop expertise is through deliberate practice, where you have some way of getting feedback about your behavior and what parts of it are and aren't successful.  That method of feedback can be built into the rules (in a more or less cool way), or it can come from expert leaders, but it has to be there or else most people will flounder without getting better.<br/><br/>Similarly, the reflection phase is actually immensely important if you're trying to teach something that you want to transfer out of the game.  People that learn skills in one context (game-like or not) tend to keep those skills in that context.  However, just <i>talking</i> about possible other applications of those skills hugely improve people's ability to transfer them.  Transfer is still really hard and not very well understood, but reflection is one of the few things known to improve it.<br/><br/>I agree that thor's general model could be made a lot more interesting, but as a set of design principles for games that teach skills, it's actually quite solid.  I'm sure there are other models that would work too, though!<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

So here's my question: in a non-authoritative setting (i.e. not work or school), what could you add to <i>Capes</i> to help people reflect on what they've learned and learn to apply these lessons in other contexts?

<p>Uh ... they can't?</p>
<p>I would totally grok if the situation were "Okay, you've just guided a character through the following motions ... now let's integrate that so that you can see that you can do the same things as a person."  That requires integration.</p>
<p>But if the game is making <em>you as a player</em> go through some motions, does it really take that much integration to learn that you, the real person, have learned that skill?</p>

                            No, Jess!! we need an answer! without facts we will just continue to voice our opinions. <br/><br/>It seems to me that the answer of course is that some people have no problems seeing that they could do what their character just did and others will have huge problems. <br/><br/>It is always easier to imagine someone else telling off their boss than doing it yourself. Part of the reflection phase is going to be about making sure that the participant is internalising the skills.                        </div>

                            I feel we're rather talking at cross-purposes.<br/>
<br/>
The perspective I was coming from was this: let's say we want to train people in negotiation skills. So, for example, I have a team of project managers who regularly need to negotiate, to persuade other companies to let them have things at the lowest cost possible and to make concessions in return. Could there be a game to train these skills?<br/>
<br/>
So, Jess, of course the feedback stage is important. We understand that, after we've played the game, we're going to sit down and talk about what we've learned (or similar). And we understand that the context is important: that if the project managers want to learn, they'll learn better, and it they don't, they won't. All valid points.<br/>
<br/>
But what I was asking was: how would you actually design the game? For example, one way of doing it would be this.<br/>
<br/>
Each player represents a country that's negotiating a peaceful end to a war. Let's call the countries, um, Alphania and Betaland. If they can't negotiate a peace treaty within an hour, the war will continue, to the detriment of both sides.<br/>
<br/>
Each side has a list of demands and a list of what they're prepared to concede, with orders of preference attached to each. For example, let's say that Alphania is particularly concerned to have control of Red Mountain, a huge mountain on the Alpha/Beta border. Betaland presently holds Red Mountain: they don't particularly want to retain control, but they don't want Alphania to take control if they're going to build a rocket base on there. Alphania also feels strongly that Betaland must not know where the Alphanian weapons are deployed.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, there'd be loads of similar quibbles. There'd probably be a map on the table. And the players would have resources which they could agree to give each other as recompense. <br/>
<br/>
Now, to me, that's a start: it's a vaguely interesting game which is going to get people to negotiate. You could divide a training group in half and get one half to observe the other playing. Afterwards, you'd talk about people's negotiating styles.<br/>
<br/>
How's that, for a start?<br/>

                            Grahm - it's a vaguely interesting game to you, but there are other people who would not find it that fun. <br/><br/>Secondly all you are doing is providing a distraction from the idea that the person is practicing negotiation, not actually providing a framework for learning negotiation. <br/><br/>I agree with you that the game would be more fun than sitting there practicing negotiating all day, but there is nothing in the model you proposed that would actually make him a better negotiator.<br/><br/>There is an outfit here in the states ( I met a guy who worked there at a freinds for dinner, I don't know more about it than that)this guy designed training materials for big companies. he taught me two things one there is a way to get to best practices by extracting the knowledge from a couple people who are allready good at something, and two training people to learn to recognise the correct completion of the steps in the task.<br/><br/>the first step he wouldn't explain to thouroughly (all proprietary don't ya know) but the gist  of it was that all people are different with inate strengths and weaknesses so sometimes they find something easy that other people find hard. Take the knowledge those people have found and extract the understanding of what it is to make it right and develope a way to let another person know when they have done that step correctly. then teach the whole thing backward step by step checking to see if there was understanding at each step. Apparently they had done this with both physical tasks (including painting figuatively) and creative tasks ( Like negotiation) <br/><br/>I bring this up because we need to know what the person needs to learn befor we make a game that makes it interesting to learn.                        </div>

                            You know, I was think about this a couple of weeks ago. I was in a corporate training course, which I always find boring a sin and in this particular one, they used a kit that was made up of plastic popsicle sticks with a hole in each end, bolts, nuts and a screwdriver bit. The objective was to use the activity as a means to determine the best way to build a process.<br/><br/>I was thinking about what kinds of lessons the corporate training world could learn from RPG's and board games to make the classes interesting and fun rather than claw-your-eyes-out.                        </div>

Yes, I'm the same with corporate training courses. Dull as ditchwater. <br/>
<br/>
Thor,<br/>
<br/>
We're just talking about two different ways to use the game.<br/>
<br/>
I'm talking about using the game as a negotiation simulation. They play the game; they observe their performance; they reflect on what was successful and what wasn't; they get better that way.<br/>
<br/>
You're talking about using the game to teach a negotiation process. They play the game and the game rewards them for following the process. They get better by learning a better process.<br/>
<br/>
They're both effective ways to use a game, I'd think.<br/>
