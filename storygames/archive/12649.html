I took some time from when the actual sessions took place to mull these issues over before writing anything up. Part of the problem I've had in writing this up is that I'm not sure exactly how to put my problems into words. It's just a feeling of dissatisfaction, a feeling of \u201cI know this could have been better\u201d that permeates my memories of our games. Hopefully, the source of my feelings will become apparent as I discuss what happened, but the title of the discussion captures my feelings somewhat: I think everyone resisted compels, and the complications and interesting difficulties that compels represent, on a player-level. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not going to discuss the city that much, because I think our city was great. Had plenty of built in conflict, some really cool points. The only issue I saw with our city was that the characters maybe should've been more directly attached to certain of the factions, and thus been more connected both to one another and to the city, but I'm not even sure that was a real problem. So I'm going to jump straight to describing the characters. These included standouts such as a former Marine, now working as an EMT, who had been infected with a demonic virus, and the only thing keeping him alive was the healing effects of the Hospitaler tabard he had recovered from the Middle East, which also allowed him to shapeshift into a towering, super-tough Crusader Knight form; an ex-Warden who had made an oath by her own magic and had broken the oath in order to kill a monster, thus losing her considerable power in evocation, and being left only with her rather poor skills at thaumaturgy (which had, of course, since improved tenfold); and a novelist who had taken it upon himself to do what Bram Stoker had done to the Black Court, by writing novels about monsters and how to kill them, and who carried on the tradition of monster-hunting in the mean time. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe were hindered by a couple of different factors, including the fact that not everyone could be there consistently, and we had to do each session as a full story, instead of splitting up stories over multiple sessions. We also wanted to experiment a bit, so some of us had many different characters to test out different builds and abilities, and we rotated the GM position a bit, too. All of this could easily have contributed to the dissatisfaction that I later felt upon looking back.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo try to put it into words, I think that one of the main roots of my dissatisfaction came from an odd tension between success and failure. None of us wanted to fail. Ever. The characters we designed were all optimally built to take advantage of the rules and powers as written, so that they would be as great as possible. For example, the ex-Warden, who could've been very interesting as a character struggling to use her Thaumaturgy, which she'd never been good at, a character so used to having immense power through evocation, and now having none of that power, was instead designed to optimize Thaumaturgy, specifically in terms of magic items. So the ex-Warden had a number of different hyper-powerful enchanted items which gave her many evocation effects at very high strength, meaning that she didn't feel weakened in the slightest. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, one could add on top of that the problem of supernatural powers. That EMT I previously mentioned could shapeshift into a super-tough knight form thanks to his tabard. This meant that he had both Item of Power and Shapeshifting. Most of his power, then, was invested in a source that was two steps away, if you will. He both had to have the Item, and he had to shapeshift to get to his Supernatural Toughness. The problem of this, however, was that it meant without his tabard, he had just lost out on most of the refresh he had spent. As a result, I hated the idea of taking away his tabard, because it would so utterly de-power him, and I was almost certain that the player would not enjoy it. Similarly, it was very difficult to me to figure out when or if to have his catch be hit, because it was, I believe, a +0 refresh catch, and when it did hit, it was the same thing; he would be losing out on both Supernatural Toughness and Inhuman Recovery, meaning that he'd be losing out on 6 refresh instantly, without any way to resist. The player would not have enjoyed this in the slightest, as he would have been losing the thing for which he had built the character. <br/>\n<br/>\nHe had made sure to set up his skills so that in his non-shapeshifted mode, he was very non-combat oriented, while in his shapeshifted form he was a combat beast. This meant that in physical combat, he was unstoppable. With 8 boxes of stress, 2 points of armor, and Inhuman Recovery on top of that, along with a Great (if not Superb, I don't fully remember) Weapons skill to provide defense in melee and a Good Athletics to provide defense from ranged attacks, it was nigh-impossible to actually cause him any degree of significant harm in physical combat. I was trying not to think of it in terms of causing him harm, too, but the fact was that physical combat with this character involved became an incredibly screwy affair thanks to his suite of powers. He could take tremendous amounts of damage, and he could dish it out with relative success, as well, because he took Claws to represent the sword that he would always get with his shapeshifted form. Everyone around him, then, in physical combat would feel nigh-useless, because nobody else was anywhere near as effective. The options that seemed open to me then were to give other characters their chances to shine in non-combat scenes, but it just wasn't the same. Non-combat scenes, even social conflicts, were never quite as thrilling, and because this character could shift his skills around through shapeshifting, he was often quite capable of ensuring that he at least wasn't useless in non-combat scenes. Furthermore, those non-combat scenes were often just cases of \u201cLet the best guy do it,\u201d meaning that the character with the best skill in the appropriate area would do it, and everybody else would just ride on his or her coattails. So I couldn't overcome the problems of this Knight overshadowing the other characters simply by granting more non-combat scenes to the others. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem wasn't just restricted to this character, as well, so it wasn't just a matter that could be solved by restricting this particular build. The pure mortal novelist monster hunter felt utterly useless in any conflict with a monster, which felt vaguely appropriate due to his pure mortal status, but also felt very odd, because he did not have an area in which he could truly shine. Or at least, he did not seem to.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that what this all brings me to is a particular mindset that seemed to have infected us. It was a mindset which we could not escape, even as we told ourselves to avoid it. We were in a very combat-focused, character-optimization based mindset. Players cared about their characters and their characters' success first and foremost, with everything else being secondary. Furthermore, players were not proactive. This meant that players mostly reacted to the story as being told by the GM, and did not engineer events in their favor with any degree of regularity. The only times players would attempt to steer events was when those events were related to combat; the novelist, whose Performance skill was at a big fat 4, never ever used that skill, though he did use his Resources to buy some flamethrowers when the characters were taking down a batch of Red Court vampires. I didn't know how to get him to a place where he might attempt to wield his Performance as a weapon to his advantage, and so it sat there, a disused, sadly interesting piece of his character that never saw any play. I, as a GM, attempted to compel the players, but these compels were often weak in how the players dealt with them, not least because the players never had an attitude of embracing the compels. Compels were always seen as a negative, as a \u201cAlright, you're screwing me now, but at least I get this fate-chip to fight back later\u201d, and the buy-out was always on the tip of the compelled player's tongue. Those compels that might lead to combat were also often utterly unimportant to some of the characters; where these compels should have been quite consequential, the fact that these characters were so damn good at combat meant that they didn't care about entering into a new fight, because they new they'd get out pretty unscathed.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd not once, not a single time, did a player compel him or herself. To me, this seems like one of the biggest tragedies, as I love the stories I've read and heard of players asking for a compel. Indeed, in one session, I hinted I wanted a compel, and the GM denied me. I was playing a young girl who had been raised by the Summer Court, and who was now in college near the city. She had just been playing her violin at the site of a Faerie attack, and in the aftermath, the police had arrived and had begun to question everyone. My character's Trouble related to her being the child of two worlds, and belonging to neither, as she didn't know the social practices of the human world, having been raised in the Summer Court, but she most certainly didn't belong in the Summer Court. I suggested that this might be a prime time for her Trouble to come in, as the police could question her, and she could answer very awkwardly thanks to her lack of understanding of human social behaviors (like lies), or even blurt out the truth, which might get her into trouble quite easily. The GM said \u201cNah,\u201d and it never happened. That's the only time I can think of during all our play when a player asked for a compel.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's my question: How does one avoid this type of play in a game like Dresden Files? In other games, you literally cannot load your character in such a way that you can focus on character optimization and your own success, and you're enticed by the game's mechanics into causing trouble for yourself. But in my experience with the DFRPG, the players had no such enticement. They optimized the hell out of their characters to make them combat machines, and the more interesting, less optimized characters like the monster-hunting novelist got screwed, as a result. Nobody ever wanted a compel, because compels were seen as bad things, and Fate Points were never truly needed; either the player would have plenty of fate points, or his or her abundant supernatural powers would more than make up for the lack of Fate Points. How does one get into a mindset where one starts seeing compels as cool ways to build up the story, as things you want, regardless of any trouble it might bring to your own character? How does one escape the mindset of thinking that one should optimize one's own character, and let the GM cause trouble for one's self, instead of at all seeking that trouble?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283974/#Comment_283974" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T09:58:36+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  9:58AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one does it explicitly.  "Hey, guys, the Dresden Files game was really unsatisfying for me because none of the characters had any interesting weaknesses and everyone was super-optimized.  Nobody ever failed.  In the books, every time Harry goes into combat it's a close thing, and I like that tension, and I don't like feeling like combat isn't dangerous." And then you talk about what you think is fun, and why you think it's fun.  What you're talking about here is a play style difference, and so it's not really about what's right and what's wrong, but about differences in tastes.  <br/><br/>Basically, there are some games that support a play style where the player makes the baddest-ass character he or she can, and the GM challenges that character and that player through the mechanics.  It sounds like the majority of the group you were playing with tried to play in that style, and you had trouble because the Dresden Files game doesn't support that play style well (which I can't really comment on - I haven't seen the books for long enough to actually read them, only say, "ooh, pretty, want") and because you want less optimized, more vulnerable characters.<br/><br/>So what I think might work for you:  be explicit about what you want to see more of.  Find players who are interested in that style of play, and try a game that's not about power and winning.  (Seeing how those players take to Fiasco, for instance, would be interesting.)  Play games with them.  Then, next time you try playing a Dresden Files game, make it explicit that characters are supposed to be humans with weaknesses and frailties and traits that can be compelled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283987">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nojh" title="Nojh"><img alt="Nojh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nojh">Nojh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283987/#Comment_283987" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T11:01:28+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 11:01AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sadly I've only gotten to read over the DFRPG rules and not actually gotten to play much. I did a city building test which was a lot of fun. But take my questions/advice with a grain of salt.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking about the lack of compels by the players, perhaps the fault lies in the character's aspects. The Fate standard rules stress that it is very important to pick good aspects. Of course basic Fate doesn't have a lot of supernatural powers. But what I'm trying to get at is, the reward for spending fate points invoking aspects should be versatile and interesting enough that players will want to have fate points handy to use them, and therefor want compels to garner fate points. The essential idea of losing a fate pool in DFRPG is that you're trading off versatility and humanity for power. Also it sounds like your characters don't rely often on maneuvers or descriptive combat that helps take advantage of tagging aspects so perhaps they're more enamored with their powers over their aspects and don't think to use them. Or did they take that out of DFRPG? I can't remember. So I guess the point of that paragraph is to point out that you can optimize your character by picking really good Aspects. And the compel system becomes apart of that optimization, that helps create a better story.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvery system is going to have its twink aspects because no system is perfect. It does sound like your human character needs a few more non-combat challenges, or some combat challenges that require some non-combat tasks within them. (Your Templar and Ex-Warden holding off monsters while she completes finding and scribing down the clues from an ancient parchment before the rising sun causes it to burn away, or something). <br/>\n<br/>\nAlso how much Fate play does your group have under it's belt? Perhaps the players aren't used to a more dynamic give and take between players and GM? There is usually more to learning how to play a social game like an RPG than just following the character creation and combat rules.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut ultimately discussing your dissatisfaction with the game with the other players is really the only way to go in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283988/#Comment_283988" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T11:06:41+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 11:06AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmm. That's some good advice, thank you. I did try to breach the subject with my players, but I guess I may not have done so with as much unfettered clarity as the way you described. I said things like, "I love it when players compel themselves" *HINT HINT WINK WINK NUDGE NUDGE*. I even tried telling them that I would compel their characters a minimal number of times, if at all, and so if they wanted fate points, they'd have to compel themselves. That experiment didn't really work, though, because they were all tough enough that they never needed the fate points for mechanical purposes, so they didn't really feel any hurt.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that your point about the fact that we were playing the game as a "GM-challenges-badass-player" kind of game is right on the money. I think we all got into that mindset, and it grated on me because I couldn't get out of it. I definitely think that I don't want to play that style of DFRPG game, primarily for the reason you point out, that the style of the book stories is focused mostly on Harry "losing", getting the shit kicked out of him, coming *this* close to failure, and I very much like that style. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here are some follow-up questions: Is there any way to provide some incentive to help players get into that mindset? Or is it something that's either going to happen, or not? And is it possible to play an optimized character, but also play such that you want to fail sometimes (which is how I would interpret Harry as having been "played" in the books)? That would be my ideal, I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also very interested on how often players actually compel themselves, and how often it's the GM's responsibility. In Dresden, when I compelled, it always was viewed as adversarial, as I mentioned above. It was a problem, not a cool story twist. If a player compelled him or herself, I envision him or herself wanting that twist, because he or she asked for it; that's why I think it's ideal. Is this common, though? Or am I dreaming an untenable dream?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283993">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283993/#Comment_283993" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T11:19:10+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 11:19AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nojh: <br/>\n<br/>\nWell, aspects are a whole other ball of wax, and I have problems with them which are purely mine. I am never quite certain of when to allow aspects to be used, when it's too much of a broad stretch to use those aspects in particular situations, and so on. The result is that often, my players wind up getting away with "Well, I'm an 'Ex-Marine', so of course I have some combat training which will let me dodge under the tentacles." The result is that multiple aspects on the character sheet become viable options in any given situation, so if a player needs to spend a fate point, he or she has a number of different options which are mechanically identical. It's a similar thing with maneuvers, too. All maneuvers are mechanically identical; a free tag worth a re-roll or a +2. As a result, they'll use maneuvers sometimes, but it'll be stuff like "I trip him", and it's always for the bonus, not for a fictional thing. The fact that a character with no fate points can do a maneuver and get a free tag, or have another character do a maneuver and take the free tag from that maneuver, simply emphasizes that these characters felt no need for more fate points, and thus no mechanical need to compel themselves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that yes, the Aspects could be an important part of the problem, but with Submerged characters (which is the level we were playing at) you wind up with enough aspects that you've got at least one that's applicable in almost any situation, at least from my perspective. Which means that you almost don't even have to worry about making good aspects, or optimization of aspects, simply because you have so many.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe twink point is absolutely valid, and I agree. I just wish there were a way around it. There were a few times when I did a challenge of the type you described, and I once or twice had a really good go of it, when I actually statted up an evil Necronomicon-like book as an opponent, and had the non-combat characters "fight" it through Academics and Resolve and the like, because it was written in an unintelligible language, and its secrets tore at their brains. Heh. But I just don't think I'm creative enough to ensure that every combat has such a twist, so that the non-combat character is never outshone. And I hated it every time he was outshone, because I liked that character a great deal. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's also a good point, about our experience with Fate. We'd played a bit of Starblazers and a tiny smidge of SotC before moving into Dresden, so it's fair to say that maybe it would only come with even more time spent in the game. I could see that. Maybe we just didn't stick with it long enough to overcome these problems.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's actually one of the things that comes up, though: I didn't feel this dissatisfaction with SotC or Starblazers. Those characters did not feel quite as "optimized" as the DFRPG characters, primarily because the DFRPG characters could have exactly the right combination of Supernatural Powers to make them incredible, and Stunts from the other two never felt like they would lead to the same kind of build.<br/>\n<br/>\nNonetheless, thanks for the points, those are some interesting things to consider. Have you ever encountered problems with players relatively new to Fate, and if so, how long did it take you to iron them out? Was it a direct conversation that did it, or was it just something that grew over play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283994/#Comment_283994" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T11:25:27+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 11:25AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think it should really be up to the GM to determine when to allow Aspect use or not.

I say this to people when I'm running Mouse Guard, which has a similar thing with Traits, and it really helps to get players in that mindset.<br/><br/>Also, they should need multiple +2's to hit\u2014in other words, being out of Fate points should really suck!  The single free +2 from a Maneuver shouldn't be enough.

Much as each game tries to pin down exactly the right number of fate points, the fact is that usage depends heavily on play style and consequently the rules of each game (in this specific regard) mostly tell you how the designers and playtesters play.<br/><br/>To keep the economy moving, players need to get low on fate points. Once they are low, they will start eying the compels. They will even start offering them. But before then there is no pressure so the question is how do you get there? There are two obvious ways I'll tell you about anyway.<br/><br/>1. Start with fewer. This is what we did in Diaspora -- start you with an insufficient number of fate points. This will frustrate tables that really sling them around, but for us and in that gritty sf environment, it worked.<br/><br/>2. Overmatch characters in combat. Because combat can end with a concession, you shouldn't feel restricted to finding encounters that you think they can win or even barely win. Instead design combat encounters that you think will kick the SHIT out of them. They will burn fate like crazy to keep that from happening and even if it does they can concede out of it in an entertaining fashion. This is our approach in Soft Horizon, where we deliberately tune tests to be extremely hard, which forces more aspect usage which forces more detailed narration explicitly relevant to the character concepts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284002/#Comment_284002" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T12:03:29+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 12:03PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint Erebus</cite>So, here are some follow-up questions: Is there any way to provide some incentive to help players get into that mindset? Or is it something that's either going to happen, or not? And is it possible to play an optimized character, but also play such that you want to fail sometimes (which is how I would interpret Harry as having been "played" in the books)? That would be my ideal, I think.<br/></blockquote>\nI think the first step has to be discussing it with the players and getting their buy-in.  If they *prefer* the heavily optimized, invulnerable play style, trying to give them incentives to change will just frustrate them and you.  But if they buy in, the best incentive you can give them is screen time.  If the result of combat is a foregone conclusion because the combat monster character is that well optimized, don't play it out - just summarize it.  Focus on the situations where you have doubt and hard choices.  Reward players whose characters have vulnerabilities by giving them opportunities to be vulnerable, and don't hose them completely if they do show vulnerability.<br/><br/>It might help if you played a few other games with that group.  I've found that In A Wicked Age really confounds and frustrates optimizers, although it doesn't do much to encourage vulnerability.  And Fiasco is pretty much concrete proof that flawed characters are interesting characters.  What you really need to do is break the association between character success and player success and the association between character failure or weakness and player weakness. <br/><br/>And you have to accept that some players just won't care for that.  That's fine - figure out who you play with when you want character vulnerability, and who you play with when you want adversarial powergaming.  (I have one friend who is a brilliant wargamer.  I have learned to not invite her to story games, because she tries to optimize, and there's often nothing there to optimize -- but that doesn't stop her from spending 45 minutes to an hour trying.)<br/><br/>As far as mechanics go, what I found with Spirit of the Century was that it usually took one player to start poking at aspects and getting some pluses from them.  Once the other players saw that engaging with the system and mechanics in that way made it possible for them to all do cool stuff, they dove in -- but it took three or four sessions before they really started getting into it.  They never really got into compelling themselves, but they reacted positively to being compelled -- the *character* was usually frustrated by it somehow, but the *players* found it entertaining.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284006/#Comment_284006" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T12:21:08+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 12:21PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The OP is loaded with different issues. The fact that non-combat scenes weren't thrilling probably played a significant role in the general malaise.\n<blockquote>Non-combat scenes, even social conflicts, were never quite as thrilling, and because this character could shift his skills around through shapeshifting, he was often quite capable of ensuring that he at least wasn't useless in non-combat scenes. Furthermore, those non-combat scenes were often just cases of \u201cLet the best guy do it,\u201d meaning that the character with the best skill in the appropriate area would do it, and everybody else would just ride on his or her coattails. So I couldn't overcome the problems of this Knight overshadowing the other characters simply by granting more non-combat scenes to the others. </blockquote>\nI haven't read DFRPG and I don't know what is said about social/non-combat conflicts in it. In Diaspora the authors did a great job at showing how it's important that these conflicts be mechanically as exciting as duels or spaceships shooting each other with torpedoes. They start with a map to embody the tactical vision. Characters are materialized on this social/non-combat map, it helps with getting every players on board. It defines victory conditions that should relate to the map design. It uses a limit on how many turns the conflict will last at most. This limit should motivate every PC to participate, even if this type of conflict isn't their forte, if only by maneuvering to help the social protagonists.  <br/><br/>Actually social conflicts in Diaspora is so open and clever that it can be applied to many RPGs, not just FATE based ones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284008/#Comment_284008" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T12:31:26+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 12:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree there are a lot of different issues here, here are some that I've had in my Dresden experience (it is my only FATE experience, because until that presentation, I didn't really get FATE.)<br/><br/>* Aspects like "Ex-Marine" that are only invoked for good things are a fate point drain. If that aspect never causes a problem for a character, it is nothing but a drag on fate points.  That is fine, so long as you have some other aspects that are only compelled, for bad things, and you gain fate points. Not every single aspect has to be both positive and negative, though that does make it easiest for everybody.<br/><br/>* The Dresden Files advice is to buy your refresh down to 1 or 2.   I think it should be more than advice - it should be a rule that you buy it all the way down to 1.  That was you are always looking for fate points if you want to do anything.<br/><br/>* Compels on Aspects should really fire up the players.  This is what the Trouble aspect is about. Trouble aspects are basically the player saying "this is the kind of tavern and old man with crumbly map that I want".  One from a game we're just designing now is "Baby Mama Drama" - the character's biological clock is ticking and everything to do with babies is enormously compelling (no pun) to her.  So if a con artist fakes being pregnant, comes to that character bawling and sobbing, "I...I..g-g-g-ot nowhere else to turn!" then the character will be all "of course I'll obtain that satanic occult book from its vampiric owner for you dear, have some tea and don't worry".  Compels are ways to get characters in trouble. If they're not enthused about a compel, they should pay to resist it, yet another fate point drain.  At some point they should be out.<br/><br/>* I'm confused about why the combat-monstar character is not being challenged in combat. The Dresden files version of FATE especially scales up to godlike badasses really fast. Is there some reason you don't have a villain at their level of combat? Like, if you knew they wanted to get into combat, and were uber badasses, how about getting an uber badass bad guy?  And compel "Ex-Marine" with an old buddy who this guy put in the hospital in a coma, and the hot red headed wife of the buddy who needs comforting, and there you go.<br/><br/>I'm also curious as to what the other players think of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284013/#Comment_284013" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T13:07:05+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  1:07PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I think it should be more than advice - it should be a rule that you buy it all the way down to 1.

I think, to be frank, that it was a consequence of the whole "player v. GM" mentality, in which they supported each other, because they were a team against the GM. So if the silly bugger wants to let them use an aspect for a bonus, well, they ain't gonna fight it. Though, I could be being uncharitable here. As for boring aspects...This relates to what I was trying to say before. We had so many that we had a few really good solid ones, which were nice and usable, and a couple that might only crop up every now and then. "Ex-Marine", for instance, was "The Few, the Proud, The Marines", which is snappier, but basically holds the same content. But then he also had "Defender of the Innocent", which isn't particularly snappy, but which is easily compellable. So is "Inherently Trusting," and "Confess and Obtain Mercy". But then, even as I look at the character sheet, I see that his trouble is "Demonic Plague", which is a reference to the demonic virus that infected him and made him weakened. Looking at that, I realize how utterly inappropriate it is, now that I've gotten some distance from the game, and read and heard some more about the Trouble aspects. Based on play with him, that was absolutely not the one thing that he wanted to cause trouble for his character, or if it was, it didn't come up at all and he didn't complain. Hmmmm. More food for thought! As for the multiple +2s, I don't know exactly what to say. Maybe I just wasn't hitting them with hard enough stuff. I thought I was, though. I think the best explanation I can provide might be that they were focusing on attrition, in general. The Templar was simply tougher than most things, and so eventually he would get that brilliant +3 roll, and they would get a -2. And thus, they would get demolished. Given enough time, he would win, unless he was going up against things just as tough. And the problem I kept feeling was that anything just as tough as him would decimate his comrades. I didn't want to make them all feel useless, while only providing an actual challenge for the one character.<br/>\n<br/>\nHalfjack:<br/>\nI'm not confident that starting with fewer fate points would do much, mostly because a number of these characters are already starting with 1, maybe 2, and don't seem to mind it. But! The idea of utterly outclassing them is...intriguing. It's something I'm naturally disinclined to do, because I don't like screwing over PCs...and yet, it does seem like that may be the answer, because of the out that exists in concessions. Hmmm. A very interesting thought, indeed. <br/>\n<br/>\nCwilbur: <br/>\nI, too, would be interested in seeing how these players handled Fiasco or In A Wicked Age. I think that the problem is right now they desperately want to play a single, lengthy game with a single character, as opposed to hopping around between games, so we're trying to settle on something. I do think it might be either an eye-opener for them, or it might be an utterly excruciating experience. And that's also a good idea, giving players who exhibit some vulnerability more stuff for doing so, without utterly hosing them. It'll work as an example.<br/>\n<br/>\nBoulet: <br/>\nI take full responsibility for the non-thrillingness of non-combat scenes. I think that if I could fix that, it might definitely help....I just have to work out how. But the Diaspora mechanics you mention sound ingenious, particularly the time-limit to social scenes. I'll have to look into those. <br/>\n<br/>\nJDCorley: <br/>\nI think the reason I never faced the combat character off against an opponent who was at his level of capability was because none of the other characters could keep up, and I didn't like leaving them in the cold. I wasn't entirely confident of how else to set up the encounter, either. But I think that's a fair point, also from the perspective that he clearly set up his character to be a combat character, so clearly the player wants combat. I already mentioned some issues with the trouble aspects, and I think it's important to bring them in much more than I did; the way I had done it so far was something like, your Trouble was a one-time hook you into the story kind of dealie. For example, the ex-Warden had "A Million Enemies, Few Friends Left" as her trouble, to indicate that she was old, and had made more enemies than friends. I used it to have an enemy crop up, and thus get her involved in an overall plot, because he wanted to cause her pain. But that was about it. So I clearly should be bringing their troubles in so much more, especially because, more than anything else, that is the "you asked for it" aspect. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs to what the other players think, well, I think a number of them became disillusioned right along with me, but I actually think that's all endemic to the way in which we were approaching the game. I think that, for instance, there were mechanical issues which felt grating on the way we played, such as the fact that "On Fire," "Bruised," "Frightened," and "I HAVE SEEN THE FORM OF THAT-WHICH-DWELLS-INSIDE" are all aspects which function identically, mechanically. So I think that we were coming at it from a very mechanistic approach, which was not appropriate. A number of us, then, were not particularly satisfied, and we took something of a hiatus/sabbatical. I'm hoping to figure out what went wrong, and do something to fix it. In general, though, I'm not sure if any of the other players was as dissatisfied as I about these particular issues with story and compels. I think that's just me being annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan:<br/>\nSee, I love the idea you espouse here, I really do.

They're constantly trying to do maneuvers to tag the bad guy or their friend or the scene with Aspects that will give the combat character an advantage.  They may not be actually attacking the bad guy directly, but when the combat character wins the fight, everyone who pitched in typically feels like a champion.<br/><br/>There are a lot of things in the system to help prevent the usual "one combat character + a bunch of noncombat characters = it's impossible to give the combat character a decent opponent" problem, but if you never put a decent opponent into the game, you'll never get to take advantage of 'em.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284046">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284046/#Comment_284046" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T16:47:09+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  4:47PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint Erebus</cite>These included standouts such as a former Marine, now working as an EMT, who had been infected with a demonic virus, and the only thing keeping him alive was the healing effects of the Hospitaler tabard he had recovered from the Middle East, which also allowed him to shapeshift into a towering, super-tough Crusader Knight form...<br/>Then, one could add on top of that the problem of supernatural powers. That EMT I previously mentioned could shapeshift into a super-tough knight form thanks to his tabard. This meant that he had both Item of Power and Shapeshifting. Most of his power, then, was invested in a source that was two steps away, if you will. He both had to have the Item, and he had to shapeshift to get to his Supernatural Toughness. The problem of this, however, was that it meant without his tabard, he had just lost out on most of the refresh he had spent. As a result, I hated the idea of taking away his tabard, because it would so utterly de-power him, and I was almost certain that the player would not enjoy it. Similarly, it was very difficult to me to figure out when or if to have his catch be hit, because it was, I believe, a +0 refresh catch, and when it did hit, it was the same thing; he would be losing out on both Supernatural Toughness and Inhuman Recovery, meaning that he'd be losing out on 6 refresh instantly, without any way to resist. The player would not have enjoyed this in the slightest, as he would have been losing the thing for which he had built the character.<br/></blockquote>\nI don't think this is actually a FATE-related issue.  I've seen the same thing in point-buy systems: the player makes a character who's really powerful in one dimension and really fragile in another... and then trusts to the social contract to keep the GM from punching his character in the glass jaw.  Your Knight is the urban fantasy equivalent of Iron Man, it seems to me. Without the armor <i>and</i> the power source, he's just Robert Downey Jr.  That sounds neat to me, but if it would spoil your guy's fun, it's a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284052/#Comment_284052" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T16:59:14+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  4:59PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Characters don't have to be weak or challenged to be interesting. Sure, that's one way to do it (a very popular way in fiction) but it's not the only way.<br/><br/>Powerful, badass characters are often great in an RPG because they are <i>consequential</i>. Their actions shake the world. Status quos are destroyed and the powerful are torn down. This can give the game a lot of momentum. If the PCs are constantly obliterating powerful bad guys, what happens in the power vacuums that result? How do all the other characters in the web react? You have instant fodder for session after session of play.<br/><br/>If your players like to play invulnerable badasses, try going down that road with them. Instead of trying to think up challenges to turn the tables on them and make them vulnerable and weak, embrace their awesomeness. How does the world react to the sudden appearance of these dangerous characters? Who's first to try to cut a deal with them? Which groups gang up for self-protection? What other 'good guys' are suddenly knocking on their door asking for favors and help?<br/><br/><b>Exploring consequences</b> is what's fun in gaming (to me). Exploring the consequences of strife and failure is one way to do it.

I could see that as being one of the biggest conceptual gaps between what my players (and myself, even) are doing, and what is ideal. Okay, I'll keep that in mind: we should choose aspects that we want to be compelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nWillH:<br/>\nThe Player v. GM mentality is certainly a problem. I'm not sure which comes first though, that mentality, or the dislike of loss and complication and love of success. So I'm sorta hoping to fix the mentality by fixing the use of aspects and compels. And yes, maybe I'm being naive and am living in a happy-go-lucky world of magical players who just have on-off switches to flick to make them go immediately to perfect players. Hey, I can dream.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuintin: <br/>\nThat character did feel a little bit out of place amongst the others, primarily just for how damn tough he was. No other character came anywhere close. (He had Supernatural Toughness, Inhuman Recovery, and one or two other stunts, and still had a solid-enough refresh, so he started every game with a few fate points. Nobody else had such a set up.) And yeah, I think you're dead on with the complications thing. I think that's exactly what the issue was, that there were no complications that the players clearly wanted to come up. Or if there were, I certainly couldn't tell what those complications were; even the characters' Troubles were treated as things to be avoided. They bought off compels a couple of times, but not terribly often. So maybe one of the issues is that I wasn't compelling enough, and should have compelled the players much more often. And they would use their own aspects when they felt they needed the +2 on the rolls, but more often, they used the free tags they got from maneuvers or consequences. Actually, I would say they used the free tags from consequences that enemies took more than anything else. <br/>\n<br/>\nPaul B and Halfjack:<br/>\nThat idea could certainly be interesting, but I don't think it'd work here. The only real thing the human novelist had going for him was a bounty of fate points at the beginning of the game, compared to the other characters' dearths. If I took that away from him, he would feel utterly puny next to the others.<br/>\n<br/>\nJDCorley:<br/>\nHmmm. Okay, I'll admit, for whatever silly stupid reason, I never actually did a combat with both silly minions and a tough bad guy. I think partly it was because Dresden Files didn't seem to support minions nearly as much as SotC did, as a direct consequence of the grittier tone. I liked that, too; I prefer tough bad guys to endless hordes of minions, myself, so my own bias probably screwed me up a little. But that's a good idea for the future.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I definitely see now that I shouldn't really have hesitated to hit them hard. Really hard. Because then it's up to them if they want to try to duke it out (and probably lose, but not necessarily), or run and arrange circumstances in their favor before they have round two. And if they do lose, they get concessions and fate points. That's certainly true; I can think of only twice in the six or so sessions that we played that characters conceded. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn terms of hitting with the trouble more often, yeah, I definitely see that now. I see that in a lot of other ways, too, like compelling "A Million Enemies, Few Friends Left" when she's even dealing with someone who's not a blatant supernatural baddie, someone she might've just pissed off with her gruff demeanor. She should have "enemies" all over town, if that's her trouble. I see that now, and I think I could do a lot better there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI never thought that the +2's weren't significant. I just think that a couple of us (myself included) weren't thrilled at the fact that a severe consequence differed from a mild consequence mechanically only in that the one lasted longer. Otherwise, they were mechanically identical, with the free tag and the +2 or re-roll. But even that's not a huge deal, I think, if some of this other stuff can be ironed out. I would say, though, that the issue of whether those +2's are most often useful on the lower skills or the top-concept skills is important. Many of the characters were designed such that the top-concept skills were the only ones that were really necessary. Those players would avoid situations where other skills might be important, or they would let other players take the reins in such situations. So, the Templar would take charge in combat, and when he was shapeshifted into human form he would take charge in healing. But he wouldn't worry about resources or contacts, because other characters could take care of that stuff. So it always sorta felt like, as long as they worked together, their lower-level skills never exactly mattered. Maybe that was another mistake I made.<br/>\n<br/>\nAccounting For Taste:<br/>\nThis did happen, as characters threw maneuvers onto baddies to allow for the main combat character to do a smack down. Maybe it's just me imposing my own feelings onto the other players, but it never seemed to satisfy the non-combat players to simply be "helping", while the combat character did "the real work". Again, I cognitively know that this isn't the right way to view it, but that's how it felt at the time. Something for me to work on.<br/>\n<br/>\nDannyK:<br/>\nThat's exactly what the issue is. I tried to explain to the player that I wanted him to choose when he lost his tabard. I wanted him to choose when his catch was hit. I wanted him to let me know when these things were okay, because if ever I did it, I felt like an asshole for just taking away most of his power. So, effectively, I was asking for his permission to do it, or I was asking for him to let me know when it would be cool with him. He never did, though, and that's exactly the problem. I think the idea of a character with a glass jaw without his special item is neat, but there have to be those times when the character doesn't have his item. As a GM, I didn't have the confidence to take it away, and as a player, he wasn't going to give it away. A vicious cycle. But now that I see that, I think I might be able to talk to him about it more, and maybe do something about it.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn: <br/>\nThat's a really interesting idea, and I'm not against that, not in the slightest. I actually really like the idea you propose, that the PCs are the real movers and shakers in the city, because they are so damn powerful. The problem that I feel there lies in proactivity. My players only ever reacted to stimulus that I threw at them, as one villain or another tried a new plan. They only ever stopped villains and made sure to return things to the status quo, wherever possible. You provide some good suggestions for how to still come at them with stimulus, such as with parties trying to make deals with them, or with other parties teaming up to maybe try to take the PCs down. But I still think this kind of play (which feels, frankly, an awful lot like Burning Empires) depends upon the players having goals, and not just reacting. Maybe I'm wrong, though, and I should give it a whirl instead of complaining. It certainly might work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284110/#Comment_284110" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T07:26:05+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  7:26AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so I'm going to do a little summary post, mostly for my own sake, to see if I got a few good points here.<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) I need to make sure that I explain to my players that the aspects they choose should be aspects they want to be compelled. Aspects shouldn't just be compellable; the players should, ideally, be interested in having them compelled. The Trouble aspect, more than any other, has to fit this mold, end of story. The other aspects should fit this mold if possible, but if not, it's not the end of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\n(2) I should talk to my players about how we view and treat compels. They shouldn't be exchanges, deals, wherein the players says, "Alright, fine, gimme that fate chip and I'll suffer through your complications." Ideally, compels should function in such a way that even without the fate chip, the players would want the compels, anyway. The fate chip is more just icing on the cake, or it can be thought of as some quantity of future narrative control, guaranteed to the player to reward him or her for the complication. That, actually, pretty much sums up what I think I need to talk to my players about: fate points given for compels are rewards, not compensation. (This is a point I feel makes sense, but I'm slightly iffy on; if anybody thinks I'm incorrect, please let me know.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(3) I shouldn't be afraid to lay it on thick. Hit 'em hard with nasties that breath lightning and move at Mach 2 and so on. Let them decide whether they want to fight or not. If they do, they can always concede, and get rewarded with fate points for the complications that arise. So I shouldn't be worried about that. And similarly, I shouldn't be afraid of compelling the hell out of their Troubles, at the least. Those Troubles should really drive play, and should come in quite often.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a lot of other things I got out of this discussion, but those are three of the big ones. I wanted to make sure I was getting the right message, here. Regardless, though, thanks for all the advice everyone! Greatly appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, just because I want to make sure I say this: I still really, really like the Dresden Files RPG. Despite the fact that I had this lackluster experience, I want to play again; I know the poor experience was because of things that I and my players were doing, and by no means the fault of the game in the slightest. So now I'm looking forward to implementing these ideas and hopefully improving my game exponentially! (Or maybe just recycling my players into meat patties and trying with a new set. It's ecologically friendly!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284132/#Comment_284132" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T09:54:30+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  9:54AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint Erebus</cite><br/>I never thought that the +2's weren't significant.

Almost all of the time, it's going to come from the GM.  That's just the Czege Principle in action.<br/><br/>It follows that if there's insufficient adversity in the game, the problem probably doesn't lie with the players.<br/><br/>"Submerged" is a super-heroic power level.  The GM has to rise to the challenge with adversaries of similar stature.<br/><br/>Off the top of my head, here's some things I would try:<br/><br/>* Ex-Marine and EMT goes to White Council:  The ex-marine and whoever else is around get summoned to White Council.  Maybe they're accused of something they didn't do or something they did do but for a good reason; happened to Harry in every other book.<br/><br/>The ex-marine walks in and Ancient Mai's wardhounds start growling at him.  They can sniff out the demonic virus in his blood.  They're getting closer now,  baring their teeth.  What do you want to do, ex-marine?  Really want to Hulk Out and defend yourself in the middle of the White Council?  And what are your friends doing?<br/><br/>* Oathbreaker:  The ex-warden gets attacked by a black wizard and his pet demons.  Not even a very competent wizard.  Now he's dead and the real wardens are not in a real forgiving mood about one of their own who has left the flock.  Mixes well with the ex-marines White Council problems above.<br/><br/>* Drycleaning Extra:  It's the ex-marine again.  He's hanging around, minding his own business, and a couple of Knights of the Cross show up.  Hey, thanks for saving the Holy Tabard for us, but we're going to need it back now.  Want to pick a fight with two guys on a Mission From God?<br/><br/>* There's no business like it:  Great news -- the novelist has had his movie rights picked up by a big studio.  They want him on site to check out their progress.  Wow, their monster effects are great.  Fantastic.  Way too good to be fake.  Do you want to take out the monstrous star of your own blockbuster movie?  <br/><br/>* Frickin' Fanboys:  Everyone loves those monster-hunting books.  Some kids love them way too much.  Now they're starting to turn up torn to shreds with a blood-soaked copy of your latest novel in their pocket.  Anything you care to do about that?<br/><br/><br/>PCs need someone to throw rocks at them.  Super PCs need some pretty big rocks.  The duty rests squarely with the GM.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway" title="Brendan_Conway"><img alt="Brendan_Conway" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">Brendan_Conway</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284167/#Comment_284167" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T13:04:21+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  1:04PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Colin:<br/>\nYeah, I realized that one when I was playing with my characters, but I had issues with the compels. Maybe the point is as you say it, that the severe consequence is much more easily compelled because, well, it's severe. But I could imagine a severe physical consequence like, um, "Broken Leg". Or would that be a major? Regardless, "Broken Leg" does not seem to be much more compellable than "Bruised" to me, primarily because I see compels from a social standpoint a lot of the time. Hell, I could compel "Bruised" to say "The police see that nice shiner you got there, and boy are they suspicious," which is purely social, but somewhat interesting. I guess I could do the same thing for "Broken Leg", but I can't really think of all that much else. And I'd feel weird about a compel of "You can't move," or something, because that feels like it's just robbing the player of an ability, instead of interestingly complicating things. Regardless, though, it is a good point, and maybe the real issue is that we need more interesting consequences to be compelled.<br/>\n<br/>\nRoger:<br/>\nI'll be honest, as I show off my fledgling feathers, and say that I had never heard of the Czege Principle until today. It's a very interesting idea though. I can acknowledge its validity, but I think there's a gradation in there in terms of what I'm looking for. I'd like for players to ask for trouble. For players to point out, say, "I'd love it if this chick I'm chatting up in the bar turned out to be a vampire, based on my 'I always pick the wrong ones' aspect." I don't know that that's really creating your own adversity, per se, because all the player would be doing is saying that he or she is interested in this one plot element which could cause problems. But all the details, and the exact manner in which it might cause problems, is left open. So she might actually be an outcast vampire, and the problems come from the fact that, by associating with her, the player has marked himself for death right alongside her, as opposed to the classic "SHE VANTS TO SUCK YOUR BLUD!" To put it another way, I don't want players to "fight" themselves, but I'd be really interested in having players tell me a few things about how they want to be confronted, the types of adversity they'd like to face, while we play. <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for sufficient adversity...well, as I've said, I plan on throwing harder stuff at them in the future. I would actually point to an interesting anecdote of play that maybe highlights some of the problems, particularly with relation to the adversity issue. I once confronted the players with flying serpents that breathed lightning. These serpents had Supernatural Speed, and because they had an Athletics of +4 and were flying, they were hard as hell to hit. Players were consistently missing. Afterwards, one of them explained that he very much didn't enjoy that. Now, at the time, I said, "I understand," but looking back in retrospect, it seems to me that this is exactly the issue. The serpents weren't particularly tough, and they were doing some damage with their lightning breath, but it was more of a war of attrition, with their longevity coming from their ability to dodge. So, this was one of those times when, theoretically, the players should have either been burning fate points like crazy to kill the serpents, or should maybe have conceded. Right? As I think back on it, this seems like the right level of adversity, because they were having difficulty, without it being overwhelming. So what do I do when a player tells me he didn't enjoy it? Am I misinterpreting what I did? <br/>\n<br/>\nRegardless, however, you do make a very good point. The adversity should've been significantly heavier than I was throwing at them. Part of the problem, I think, lay in the conceits of our game...we set up our city such that the White Council had a minimal presence at best, and didn't particularly have an interest in the city. Nor did any of the other main factions, for that matter. White Court and Black Court had no presence, Red Court had absolutely minimal...Summer and Winter were banned from the city by the terms of a treaty they had signed with the Primal Fae of the area...so maybe we kinda crippled ourselves a little bit. But yes, I admit that I need to throw "Submerged" level foes and adversity at them. And some of the ideas you threw out there are great. I really like your ones with the novelist, and your ones with the Drycleaning. Actually, one of the better story arcs we did actually sort of covered one of those plotlines, as the ex-Warden had to read a dark, Necronomicon-esque book and summon an Outsider in order to kill another Outsider called the Harrower, thus giving her Lawbreaker and plenty of future complications there. But those are some great ideas, and I will now shamelessly and mercilessly steal them and torture them into whatever shapes I desire! MUAHAHAHA!

And if you or the players are not interested in the ramifications of a consequence then take a few more minutes to find one that is interesting and cool, specially if it will be around for a bit. So Dude with a broken leg is about to chase the big bad? Compel that shit - "Ok so you take off after Wizard McBad, and that is when your foot comes down at a bad angle and your almost healed broken leg sends a bolt of pure pain to your brain, would you like a Fate Point to bring your consequence in? Ok good, do you have another way to catch him or can he escape for now so he can show up for the big showdown later?" or "So the innocent bystander is about to get clobbered by that werewolf, but your broken leg makes it impossible to get to her in time\u2026 right? (Hands player a Fate Point) So what are you going to do to save her without moving or are you just going to lay there and let her die?" It's all about providing cool choices and opportunities to do neat things as opposed to dick moves that only block the player. Perhaps the shift needs to be from "I just got hosed by the compel" to "crap I can't do that right now, but I have a shiny new Fate Point and how can I use it to try something else...."<br/><br/>Edit - Just to add a few more thoughts on compelling. <br/><br/>Compelling should also be a give and take between the players and the GM, if a compel is BS and little more than a "don't move" then the player should speak up and suggest another worthy action or effect of the compel that is worth the Fate Point. This is also a nice way to get the players involved in providing imput on their own compels. Most of the time when I compel I either provide a nice juicy choice or ask the player if he would like to bring an aspect in to play to complicate things. Sometimes I have to nudge a little to get it going but most of the time my players need little help playing there aspects to the hilt, trouble and all. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284565/#Comment_284565" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T01:52:06+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  1:52AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2010 1:55AM by noclue.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint Erebus</cite>I suggested that this might be a prime time for her Trouble to come in, as the police could question her, and she could answer very awkwardly thanks to her lack of understanding of human social behaviors (like lies), or even blurt out the truth, which might get her into trouble quite easily.

Remind me not to play with that GM. <br/><br/>I'm one of the players Colin is talking about and if I were to suggest a compel that he wasn't feeling, I couldn't imagine him shutting me down like that. He'd likely suggest a variation on what I was saying and we'd riff back and forth until we both liked what was happening.\n<blockquote><br/>So here's my question: How does one avoid this type of play in a game like Dresden Files?

Choices were made that screwed the novelist and shone the spotlight on the combat machines.\n<blockquote>Fate Points were never truly needed; either the player would have plenty of fate points</blockquote>This is the biggest issue. Fate points are a pacing mechanic. If the GM doesn't put the players in a position where Fate points have worth, the currency can't do its job. You're going to have to put them in situations where they either spend Fate or fail. If they're uber-mensches, hit them harder. Threaten the things they care about. Split the party by threatening the things several players care about at the same time.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint Erebus</cite>Regardless, though, it is a good point, and maybe the real issue is that we need more interesting consequences to be compelled.</blockquote>Maybe. I don't think the problem is with the consequences. "Broken leg" is pretty mundane, but is not very difficult to compel in interesting ways. The key is to wait until the compel is actually interesting and if you can't think of something cool at that moment, compel something else. Wait until the character is fleeing for his life, or sneaking up on someone, or trying to save his aunt may, and then compel the leg. Say something like "I want to compel your broken leg right now to say that you don't get to her in time and Aunt May is kidnapped by the Red Court Vampire that just grabbed her. Have a Fate point!" And make sure that when you do it, the character really wants some Fate points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
