I'm not entirely certain of the protocol for press releases here, but I figured the news was likely to be of sufficient interest and wanted to make ourselves available for any questions you guys might have. Here's the release:<br/>\n<br/>\nDOJ INC. ANNOUNCES ACQUISITION OF MAJORITY SHARE IN INDIE PRESS REVOLUTION<br/>\n<br/>\nJune 17th, 2010- New York City, NY: DOJ Inc. is proud to announce that they have closed a deal to acquire a majority share of Indie Press Revolution, the industry's leading direct-sales network of high-quality small press game publishers, and will be taking over administrative operations of the company beginning July 1st, 2010. The minority shareholders have all approved the sale and will be retaining their ownership shares in the company. <br/>\n<br/>\n"I'm delighted to be taking over a sales organization with the brand strength and reputation for quality that IPR has built over the last several years," says Darren Watts, President of DOJ Inc. "IPR has a very strong business model and has done an outstanding job representing its client creator-publishers, and we intend to carry forward with the same philosophy in order to bring great new games to the public from the cutting edge of game design."<br/>\n<br/>\n"I'm excited to be working with Darren, Jason, and the rest of the DOJ team," said Ryan Macklin, General Manager of IPR, who will be remaining in that position. "They have an excitement about IPR that I relish, and I'm looking forward to the future they'll bring to this company."<br/>\n<br/>\n"DOJ Logistics has already been providing IPR and its publishers complete shipping and warehousing services since August 2008," said DOJ Logistics Director Jason Walters, "so both the publishers and the customers of IPR should receive the same fine service they've come to expect." <br/>\n<br/>\n"DOJ Inc has been providing IPR great service and over the years we have developed a close relationship with the warehouse staff. I can't think of any better partner for IPR to help the business grow and thrive in the years to come," said Brennan Taylor, owner of Galileo Games and outgoing President of IPR. Mr. Taylor is retaining a minority share in IPR, as well as remaining a client publisher, and will be assisting DOJ in the transition.<br/>\n<br/>\n\t\t\t\t\t###<br/>\n<br/>\nABOUT INDIE PRESS REVOLUTION<br/>\n<br/>\nIndie Press Revolution is a consolidation house and direct-sales network of quality small press game publishers, dedicated to establishing a community in which creator-publishers can flourish and share their ideas and visions together in a cooperative environment.

(See his tweets) He set it up, built it up, ran it for years and now has sold most of his shares - good work, I think. Because DOJ run the warehouse, the transition will be almost unoticeable, and I hope to see some improvements on the webstore side of things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/iago" title="iago"><img alt="iago" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.iago.net/storygames32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/iago">iago</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276591/#Comment_276591" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T10:24:17+00:00" title="June 17, 2010 10:24AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Well, Brennan won't be running things, so that's a big change!<br/><br/>My question is, was Brennan on board with this sale or was it a take-over?</blockquote>\nFunny! There's no way to do a take-over on a privately held company. Brennan was the majority shareholder, looked for a buyer, and found one in DOJ (who's already been running the IPR warehouse/shipping operation since 2008 IIRC). I believe he did so because he's interested in using his not-day-job hours to focus on his publishing biz rather than everyone else's. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276593/#Comment_276593" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T10:26:06+00:00" title="June 17, 2010 10:26AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, all amicable.

We have had a lot of new games come into the hobby but not an actual company.  I would love to hear the whole story from Brennan one day, how much faith he had in the beginning, what his vision was and so on.  It's also a testimony to the stability of the small publisher and independent design scene.  And finally, let's hope this marriage between a larger company that produces a fairly traditional system and a distribution company that emphasizes non-traditional designs will help further bridge the cultural gaps in our hobby and increase diverse growth going forward.<br/><br/>I think this is very exciting news.

Yeah, actually Brennan came to us first a few months ago. We've been doing the warehousing and shipping since August of '08, so we know that side of it, and we've been big fans of the operation and the publishers it represents. Hero even has had a couple products listed with IPR (PS238 and Lucha Hero, self-contained games we thought might appeal more to the IPR fanbase than the more traditional stuff we do.) Brennan was the majority owner, now he's a minority owner, so he's still around to help us smooth over any bumps in the transition. Everybody is still on board, especially Ryan, who will still be General Manager but will have some customer-service-type jobs taken off his desk so he can do more direct publisher contact and support as well as some cool social media stuff for us. Jason Walters, who owns and runs our warehouse, will be the direct guy for ordering, shipping and stock questions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd yeah, we'll all be one big happy conglomerate at Origins, where DOJ is supplying and running the booths for Hero, IPR, Evil Hat (debuting the Dresden Files hardcopies!) and the GPA Showcase, so come savor the madness. (Actually, since IPR had already done all it's Gencon setup before we took over, it means I'll have to spend most of *that* show running between our booths like a madman.

One thing we'll have to be talking a lot about in the near future is IPR's brand management. IPR has a great reputation, and would it dilute it in any way to add really cool but more traditional rpgs, or card games, or minis games, or whatever from small publishers that are indie in makeup and strategy but maybe not part of the indie design aesthetic? I tend to think not, but I'll be sure to get as many current IPR publishers and fans to weigh in before deciding that. Maybe we'd wind up with multiple storefronts all supported by one back end and sharing the same business model. As I did when I took over Hero, I consider this job to have a certain amount of responsibility to the fans and the creators who made it as cool as it is, and I don't intend to be "the guy who screwed up IPR." ;) dw                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276662/#Comment_276662" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T13:33:14+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  1:33PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Darren, I like some of your ideas, and would love to see them progress <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> If at any stage you'll open up for our opinions (more like tirades), I'll happily join the masses in giving you mine ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts" title="Darren Watts"><img alt="Darren Watts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts">Darren Watts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276669/#Comment_276669" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T13:57:39+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  1:57PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            T-G: I'm always open to listen.

I think sometimes this was masked by the IPR site being somewhat nontransparent to navigate, so folks tended to mostly stick with games they were specifically looking for or had been linked to. But I think that IPR has always been theoretically open to any games produced by individual or small groups of designers.  I can imagine the potential for some of the more hardcore pro-"creator rights" indie designers to passively or actively resist perceived shifts in IPR's mission, but, in my mind at least, those shifts are nothing new and represent a natural broadening of the indie community, something that is already happening in other areas. Honestly, if you can make the site *more usable* I don't think anyone will have much to complain about as far as content, as long as there isn't a flood of mediocre products that make it difficult to find the good stuff, as on RPGnow and other places.<br/><br/>The biggest challenge for IPR is maintaining and expanding its quality of service.  With the shift by many individual publishers back to handling much of their own distribution (the Unstore, the Burning Wheel store, etc.) and some mixed feelings about IPR's initial foray into selling to retailers (which I think a lot of publishers, including myself at the time, weren't adequately prepared for), IPR is still doing really well, obviously, but may no longer represent the default distribution choice for many current and upcoming indie publishers.  Instead, it's a significant option within a still limited cloud of different distribution options, and many publishers are choosing to combine multiple different methods at the same time (maybe due to the collapse of Wizard's Attic and the closure of Key20, warnings not to place all your eggs in one basket).  IPR may not have any strong challenges yet, at least in its core services, but it would be a shame to rest on your laurels, especially in a relatively volatile business environment, with the potential for major shifts nearly constant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts" title="Darren Watts"><img alt="Darren Watts" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Darren%20Watts">Darren Watts</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276689/#Comment_276689" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-17T14:38:41+00:00" title="June 17, 2010  2:38PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans: Yeah, sorry 'bout that.

I agree, we're more interested in companies that are "indie" in makeup and economics. <br/>\n<br/>\nThere will always be publishers for whom IPR isn't the best or only solution, and we're fine with that. I don't think it's any secret that DOJL also does Luke's warehousing, and Ron's as well, and Fred's non-IPR stuff. If publishers with IPR grow to a point where they have other options, well, that's a success story in its own way, and hopefully they'll have liked working with us enough to slide over to another part of the company. One thing I think IPR can do more of is early support, maybe even mentoring, of young publishers so they can draw on the accumulated hard-won lessons of others in the community, and it would I think be very cool and rewarding to help formalize some of that. dw                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276824/#Comment_276824" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-18T15:12:33+00:00" title="June 18, 2010  3:12PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2010 5:19PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Darren Watts</cite>Maybe we'd wind up with multiple storefronts all supported by one back end and sharing the same business model.</blockquote>I love this idea.

I wouldn't do it like David suggested, based on technical product properties, though. Rather, I'd make the storefronts charged with culture politics and artistic claims of what the games picked for the storefront represent - make the storefronts clique-like, effectively. Separating one-shot games or "games that use dice" or whatever is weak-ass, but having a "Design Matters" storefront - now that would be something. I know that this suggestion basically amounts to drawing lines and putting all the "real Forge games" into one basket and separate from the nasty mainstream stuff, but if that's how I as a customer like it, why not? It's not like this storefront business would need to be arbitrarily authoritative: give the authors a bunch of checkboxes through the control interface to self-select their stuff into the various storefronts and always keep a central general storefront that lists everything IPR has. The important goal would be to help customers find stuff they like, after all, and let's be honest - that's not going to happen by pretending that games do not carry cultural legacies. I don't oppose expanding IPR's selection with any companies that can make use of the service, but it would be nice to be able to sharpen the cultural identities and make statements a bit more; nowadays the mere fact that a game is at IPR doesn't really say anything at all about its substance, unlike the early days when the product base was dominated by Forge-influenced designers. It seems to me that embracing cultural variety and stressing the differences would be helpful in guiding the audience to find new styles of game and new games in their preferred style.<br/><br/>My viewpoint on this is coloured by my own retail hobby; the Finnish Arkenstone store is a pretty ideologically coloured affair, as it only stocks stuff that is not available through normal distribution, and does not restock things I'm not personally happy with quality-wise; the nature of the project is necessarily elitist in some sense, no way around that. Obviously I've been a bit disappointed with the less focused and more practical course IPR has taken in its development - but that does not mean that I don't accept it, so no reason for anybody to get angry at my opinion. I'm interested in this storefront thing specifically because it might work as a sort of compromise between exclusivity and inclusivity: IPR could continue expanding its clientele arbitrarily without simultaneously diluting the webstore interface it presents to the customer. As things stand I've stopped actively exploring the IPR selection altogether in the way I used to through its first couple of years: it used to be that I could be reasonably certain that if I hadn't heard about some game at IPR, then I should take steps to remedy the situation. Today, with all the comics, trad games and other stuff outside my own field of interests that isn't so practical.<br/><br/>(No need for anybody particular to feel like I don't want to associate with their product as a publisher, by the way. I'm all for it if IPR wants to establish an "Eero's Best Picks" storefront, but outside something like that I can assure everybody that my interest in segmenting the product pool is for the purpose of showing each product honestly as what they are, culturally speaking, not to put "bad games" and "good games" into separate boxes. Both my customers and yours benefit from it if they can get a more clear sense of what the basic nature of our products is.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276935/#Comment_276935" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T08:05:08+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  8:05AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, the 'Oughts are over.

As it happens, neither of us is responsible for developing IPR, so luckily we don't need to agree about whether it's a good idea to increase product differentiation on a storefront level or not. I happen to think that this is the future of Internet shopping, what with the constantly increasing information flow and greater need for customer fastidiousness in finding the specific products and services you're interested in. No moral implications intended, it's just that humongous single-destination webstores (Amazon, anyone?) service different needs and audiences than specialized, product-oriented boutiques. With modern web design techniques it is quite trivial to offer both from the same databases and servers, and with an effect that I think the seller will find positive: a strong specialty brand with credibility in the eyes of the discerning customer can only be created by building trust in your commitment to "quality" product, whatever that means to the individual customer (unless your plan is to compete on price and quick delivery while remaining culturally neutral, like Amazon does - but as described, it's trivial for a webstore to offer the best of both worlds with multiple storefronts).<br/><br/>Edit: I've actually got a good example of what I mean. Is the DC comics brand "Vertigo" morally obnoxious? I mean, they dare have the temerity of separating some comics under different commercial brands in an effort to distinguish them in the eyes of the customer base.

That's one company who is deciding what does and doesn't qualify for the Vertigo imprint.  They develop the products.  With IPR, it is a clearing house for other designers.  How do you decide what does and doesn't qualify?  Especially as game design has evolved so much now that the idea of something being "Forge-influenced" is almost meaningless at this point.  Your points of distinction no longer really exist as a separate school of thought since they've been released into the wild, intermingled and taken root all over the place.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276946/#Comment_276946" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T09:56:50+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  9:56AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might be expressing myself in a somehow problematic manner. Perhaps the problem is that I'm myself part of one special-interests audience. It might be difficult to believe that I genuinely bear no ill will towards traditional game design and publisher, even if I rarely get excited by the level of design and writing in such products. That's a geek fallacy right there: I don't need to be a fan of something to not be its enemy. The fact that I happen to like different things than you does not mean that my suggestion to provide opportunities for cultural markers means a wish to specifically ostracize the products you like - I'm arguing for equal but distinguished presentation, not a pruning of the product base. I think that this is a much more fruitful approach from a marketing viewpoint than the "everybody is the same" approach to cultural plurality that would be the alternative - not being able to say that "my game is a D&amp;D clone" because that offends people seems stupid to me. To the contrary, the more clear I can be about the D&amp;D-clonish nature of my product, the happier the customer should be, as he's getting better knowledge of the nature of my product.<br/><br/>It should be unnecessary to emphasize that whatever the nature of these hypothetical specialized multiple storefronts, I think that they should be opt-in in nature, and primarily publisher-controlled. The proper intent is to allow the publisher to direct and focus the exposure of his products to the right audiences, not to put the IPR staff in a position where they have to be making controversial judgment calls about extremely complex things such as the cultural positioning of individual products. In fact, you know what would be radical? Request publisher feedback on the types of alternative storefronts that they'd like to have, thus ensuring that no unnecessary or obnoxious identifications and groupings of product are made. I myself get nothing out of a "GM-less games storefront", but I guess if there are folks who get excited about something incidental like that, more power to them - and feel free to list Zombie Cinema there, it's as GM-less as the next game.<br/><br/>I've ended up arguing similar marketing strategies lately for some reason. Just a while back I was trying to talk James Raggi into including OSR buzzwords on the box of his new game on the principle that his audience will find the game, understand and get excited about it better if it doesn't beat around the bush, but rather says directly that it's an old school renaissance product, compatible with D&amp;D adventure modules, designed for dungeoneering and hexcrawl and all the other good things of that tradition. James had a similar reaction in that he expressed a desire to have his product considered on its own virtues without an interpretative cultural context. Perhaps there is something here that I'm not seeing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276948/#Comment_276948" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T10:03:39+00:00" title="June 20, 2010 10:03AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Probably a "People who bought this product also bought..." link aggregation at the bottom of each product page would work without cordoning games off into cliques at the shop level.<br/><br/>However, to do something like that, IPR would also have to aggregate games together based on product type: For example, the Maid RPG has a link for PDF, Book and PDF, and Book Only: It's "one product", but in the system it basically comes off as three different products.  So someone leaving a review on one of the links won't get populated to the other two; if someone buys one of the products, it won't link "also boughts" to the other product pages, etc.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think what Eero suggests makes sense, but it's not IPR's job to do so, it's up to the publisher: Create a link to your homepage in your listing, and on your homepage you signify which other games are like yours, or form cooperatives, or whatever.

I'm myself pretty well-read on Forge-influenced game design and disagree to a degree with the claim that there is no "design school" associated therein, but that's neither here nor there: I'm not saying that we need a "Forge games storefront", I'm saying that it'd be cool if we could find exciting cultural groupings of games and push them via their own storefronts. This goes for the "Old School storefront", "Structured Freeform storefront", "Traditional Design storefront", "GURPS clone storefront" (probably not under that name) or whatever categories are found fruitful in terms of customer interest - as things that customers are specifically and realistically looking for. It's just a tagging system, really, except it instantiates as multiple webstores instead of small labels next to the product description.<br/><br/>To emphasize: I don't want an a priori Forge storefront - I want a considered marketing decision about whether there is value in targeting the customer segment that is primarily interested in Forge-style games. I'm part of this segment myself, so I'm inclined to think that this is a real phenomenon and that there are customers who would appreciate it. The same goes for a "OSR storefront", I could well see myself being interested in that. But I'm not the customer base, so this needs to be considered from real marketing viewpoint, not on the basis of my parochial preferences. Heck, I don't know - perhaps there is a huge audience out there convinced that having dice or not having dice makes a game fundamentally different; if there is, I'm all for a "diceless games storefront". My suggestion of culturally defined storefront branding is on the basis of my belief that customers are primarily interested in specific design traditions and philosophies, not in ephemerals like whether the game uses dice or has a GM (except when this trait is part of the overall design philosophy, of course, like it is with certain brands of mainstream design).<br/><br/>Something like this can be implemented without any sort of authoritative overview, as little more than a Facebook friends application - just let the publishers themselves decide whether they have similarities in design and publishing philosophy that are sufficient to build a separate storefront from. Force nobody to participate, but allow those who are interested in more focused branding to express their marketing strategy in the trade dress IPR uses. As Olman says (and I agree), the IPR brand has consistently been diluted for a while, and it's only going to dilute more - if there is any wish to offer services to discerning audiences instead of just being another average webstore, then it seems like multiple storefronts are a fine solution that allows differentiation without requiring the fulfillment service itself to become exclusive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276951/#Comment_276951" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T10:25:56+00:00" title="June 20, 2010 10:25AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Anyway, I think what Eero suggests makes sense, but it's not IPR's job to do so, it's up to the publisher: Create a link to your homepage in your listing, and on your homepage you signify which other games are like yours, or form cooperatives, or whatever.

It does scuttle the whole idea, though, regardless of the basis of differentiation: if the strategy is to rely on the publisher websites as the primary orientation and feed for customers, then the storefront brand itself is pretty unimportant: we don't need several storefronts or worry about the supposed special nature of IPR and its brand, as the customer is in the store to get this one game they're interested in, not because of the attraction of IPR itself as a store brand.<br/><br/>I personally have no trouble if IPR is interpreted as a value-neutral institution with strengths in regularity, customer-service and good business practice. The only immediate problem I see there is that this interpretation loses any specific niche IPR might have had at some point as a convention shopping destination (or web-shopping, for that matter): IPR has no particular reason to have a convention presence any more than any other store has if everything IPR is is just another average store. The distinctive brand has, I understand, been the driving motor behind IPR efforts at joint marketing.<br/><br/>So I guess what the IPR crew has to decide on in their strategy is ultimately whether IPR should develop a culturally distinctive brand or brands in the eyes of the customer base, or whether it should rely on the reputations and marketing of its publisher base solely in attracting customers. Both are entirely reasonable propositions to my mind; historically IPR has had pretensions for brand-building (it even has a community forum), but the brand isn't really carried meaningfully in the concrete product choices and such, so it might be worthwhile to clarify the strategy, at least in the minds of the executives if nowhere else.<br/><br/>(There might, of course, be other choices as well - or that might even be a false choice. My viewpoint is by necessity coloured by my own retail hobby, I see the choices IPR faces from the same viewpoints I've had to figure out myself in deciding what my store is about.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276956/#Comment_276956" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T10:52:31+00:00" title="June 20, 2010 10:52AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I must say it is heartening to hear those two designers resisting categorization like that.  I'm not sure what their thoughts are, but in general response, I think that it is very difficult to actually categorize things.  When you slot something into a certain category, you do damage to the reality of the space it actually occupies.  I think it is kind of in our nerdy nature to want to categorize things (a strong trait among adolescent males) and there was possibly a need for people to distance themselves from traditional design in the early days of the various fringe movements in the hobby.  Defining oneself loudly and setting up categories is a good mechanism to make distinctions and underline areas where change needs to take place.  But ultimately, it is a reductivist activity and since the changes have been made, the categories are becoming less and less important.<br/><br/>So say that IPR does set up a system of tags.  How many producers are going to want to self-select?  Some may see it as an opportunity to attract a specific type of gamer.  Others may see it as a negative, excluding them from a broader customer base.  Sales strategy aside, some may feel that they just want their games played and they don't care about how potential players feel about their design philosophy.<br/><br/>I can understand how you as an individual with specific tastes would like a sorting mechanism so that you can discover and identify games that would work for you.  But I really feel that there is something prescriptive about your proposal, though I can't actually put my finger on it.  I just think most gamers, the hardcore ones who are online and into design and looking at new stuff are less and less concerned about the distinctions you want to make.<br/><br/>As an example, we are having <a href="http://roludo.ca/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=180" rel="nofollow">our first Roludothon</a>, a mini-con here in Montreal and the games offered are Wild Talents, Maid, Mouse Guard, 4e, Wild West Cinema, Hunter: The Vigil and various board games.  We have some people who identify more "indie" but for events like this, the deciding factor for who is going to play what is usually more about newness, who is running the game and genre rather than any philosophy or approach of game design.  We've pushed hard for this kind of diversity in our community and there is still a game store where everybody pretty much plays D&amp;D on their GameDays (where we'll be invading soon, heh heh), but I think that we represent the future much more than something divided along "cultural" lines and I think that IPR is going to reflect that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_276961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276961/#Comment_276961" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T12:05:36+00:00" title="June 20, 2010 12:05PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree on the general observation that people are getting more used to differences in the field of roleplaying nowadays. Perhaps it's just that the people with a chip on their shoulder about their own one true way of gaming have been less vocal, no way to know. My own suggestion about this phenomenon is that what it should mean is that we should all be able to be more <i>secure</i> about our preferences and more <i>aware</i> of the potential richness in the varieties of roleplaying instead of being timid and downplaying them. This newfound reasonability mostly shows up in my own experience in that I get less people ready to get up my nose about my temerity in publishing games without a GM or games that don't feature adventures or whatever it is that a particularly narrow-minded individual considers the hallmark of roleplaying. I don't see this translating into a particularly wider game preference on my own part: I read and play just like I've always done, sampling many things and focusing on the stuff that interests me. It seems utterly unrealistic to me to say that the mellowing of the hobby scene would lead to a situation where I wouldn't <i>care</i> about what I play: the things I like are still the same even while people are being more courteous about their different tastes. The atmosphere of amity translates into more open affirmation of your preferences, not into those preferences somehow disappearing. The latter would only be true if my preferences were illusory - perhaps they are, or perhaps they are that for the majority of gamers, but if this is the case then it seems like this specialty storefront idea won't do much either way. Just figure out whether it's credible that there would be a lot of customers like me who'd appreciate it, and if not, then don't execute it. Or try it out and put a stop to it once it becomes obvious that nobody wants to use the specialty boutique, whatever.<br/><br/>I do admit that this is no obvious choice for IPR; it is entirely possible that people, especially the vocal pundits, would get offended by the mere existence of an exclusive storefront even when it takes nothing away from the general main store. It's an ideological challenge when somebody claims to be able to distinguish something you don't believe exists, I suppose - so having a "Design Matters" storefront that claims to deliver a selection of "focused game design beginning from the fundamentals, as opposed to accepting received traditional wisdom"... I can understand how the mere existence of something like that would offend a person who thinks that either the featured games aren't roleplaying games or that they're just like these other games that are not featured. Heck, it would probably be enough for annoyment if you just don't like the games featured and then see them being proudly displayed like they were somehow honorable and worthy of attention. I know that I myself can feel a twinge of annoyment when rubbish (from my viewpoint) is being marketed without utter humility. It's not a reasonable complaint when the existence of this hypothetical webstore or storefront takes nothing away from the availability of your own preferred style of game, but it is rather human to be annoyed by something like that. I can totally understand it if IPR decides to keep away from taking a stand in this sort of cultural debate. I guess ultimately it depends on their estimation of what is the best way to accomplish the company's core mission of making small press games available to the audience; I myself believe in honesty and powerful messages even when they might be controversial, but IPR might be large enough to get by with a moderate strategy of trying to not offend anybody anywhere for any reason.<br/><br/>But then, if that's true - IPR decides to not implement specialty storefronts for fear of offending pundits - that seems like a pretty damning argument against this idea of ours that the scene is moving towards greater amity and understanding. What sort of amity is it if you can't handle the idea that somebody else might be interested in some types of games to the exclusion of others? I've never gotten angry at the fact that there are plenty of roleplayers out there who like different games than I do. I did not start publishing Forgista games here in Finland to convert everybody into my one true way of gaming, I did it to increase variety and bring these games to people who like the same things I do. I can't understand why this would be a bad thing, unless you happen to think that my preferences in gaming are completely deluded.<br/><br/>Another angle on the matter: if a specialty storefront is a bad idea, would it also be a bad idea for IPR to have a "OSR theme week" that would showcase the OSR movement and the exciting new games coming out of that culture, such as the soon-to-be-released LotFP game? I'm asking about the OSR because I'm interested in whether it's just the Forge that is not appropriate in polite company, or if all subcultural self-identifications in roleplaying should be cleansed from IPR activities. To me it seems obvious that increasing the IPR toolbox in terms of marketing the products available (in manners fair and equitable among the IPR clients) is a net positive, and tools like specialty storefronts, theme weeks, IPR front-page articles on upcoming or recently released products... anything and everything that helps educate the buying audience and increase their knowledge of and commitment to keeping abreast of small press gaming developments is a net positive for IPR. I am obviously of the opinion that devoting the main IPR homepage to the big header "Eero Tuovinen publishes a new game!" wouldn't be fair to everybody else in the store, but that's why increasing the available interface space by establishing specialty subselections and otherwise emphasizing the geography of the field of products seems like a good idea. Just imagine what types of product information and marketing material could be involved in a boutique storefront representing a half dozen small-press publishers instead of the couple of hundred the IPR site represents at the moment! Acknowledging new products as clear main page news items is just one of the things that could be done with that sort of store set-up. I can't imagine that this sort of thing wouldn't be beneficial compared to the current site design that pushes relatively random products at you when you visit the site.<br/><br/>(Interesting discussion, by the way - good of you to question my angle, Olman.

Consumers are only a vague guidepost, and as walkerp points out, the ones that have broad tastes are going to fuck things up for the ones that have narrow/specific tastes. "Hey, I loved Fiasco and Burning Empires, you should try one if you liked the other."  That's not to say a decent categorization system couldn't be developed, but it would have to be by someone much smarter than me.<br/><br/>Promotions like the one you describe, Eero, would be really great, and I see that as quite a different thing.  <br/><br/>I should note that rpgnow/drivethrurpg has both "most popular" and "newest thing" lists on the front page of their site, or quickly accessible.  Also they have one for each publisher, so if you're looking at something from (say) White Wolf, on the side of the screen it'll show you the 10 most popular White Wolf products.<br/><br/>But for a consumer like me, for whom popularity is irrelevant and who sees no value in chasing the newest thing, that's wasted space. I actually prefer the randomness at that point.

I realize that they aren't perfect, but they would help me wade through the many products available to suit my purchasing moods.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276984/#Comment_276984" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T17:17:28+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  5:17PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, see, Orklord and I are on the same page.  It's not about telling the consumer what's important.  It's allowing them to find and organize products according to whatever's important to them.  I think IPR's current "By Genre" categories are valuable in just that way, and I'm suggesting extending that approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

There's no reason to buy from any given shop if they're all selling the same sweatshop clutter. An online RPG shop not dealing in used games has three options: 1) sell everything and compete on price, because there's no other reason than price for a customer to choose you over RPGshop or whoever, 2) drive to have a more complete product catalog than anyone else so your business lives in the long tail (ala Amazon.com), or 3) sell a curated catalog of games and work to be significant via the social media space.<br/><br/>As an indie game publisher, the one to be afraid of is <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_276999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R." title="Moreno R."><img alt="Moreno R." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Moreno%20R.">Moreno R.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/276999/#Comment_276999" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-20T19:20:18+00:00" title="June 20, 2010  7:20PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2010 7:21PM by Moreno R..">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So if I don't want to buy a game and find the usual "stuff" I threw out years ago from my bookshelves (books filled with bad "literature", badly playtested rules followed by the usual "if it doesn't work, you can always change it!" note, a all-powerful GM, a list of 300 skills and powers and items and tast resolution and fortune-at-the-end all around, that kind of stuff, you know...), but I am not fixed in a one-true-way niche ("only games with a GM!"

In fact, I have only been an IPR customer when a post here on Storygames, some other forum, or the designer's blog linked me directly to the product page on IPR. It's because of designers such as Jason Morningstar, Ben Lehman, Tim Kleinert, Christian Griffen and Fredrik Jensen that I have an IPR account at all... Should Jason suddenly make the move to selling through DriveThru or the Unstore or Amazon, well, I would buy his games from whatever webstore he likes and probably not even notice.<br/><br/>This is not at all like much smaller sites, such as the Unstore or Aarkenstone, where I have at times loaded the main page just to check for new products.

If you don't know exactly what you're looking for, it's impossible to find it.  The multiple listings for the same product are really annoying to wade through (print, pdf, print+pdf). Searching by genre is pretty much useless when you have categories with almost 200 products.  Not differentiating games from supplements makes it more difficult.  Searching by system is useless for the majority of games SG folks would be interested in. The best way to find products is the "recommendations" section, but those are limited and rarely updated if at all.  The experience of buying things from the website is really just not that pleasant and I feel like IPR would move a lot more product if the set up was more user-friendly and useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277282/#Comment_277282" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T09:14:34+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  9:14AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a quick point of note, while were being quiet on this thread right now -- partly due to Origins eating our faces -- we are keeping an eye on what you're saying.

IPR had the best (read, cheapest) shipping options of any distributor out there.  They had the option for USPS, as opposed to FedEx or UPS who collude with Canada Customs to put a huge importation fee as well as overpriced shipping rates.  I say "had" because I haven't ordered anything from them for about a year now, but I do know that Fred was aware of the shipping issues to Canada and specifically made sure to address them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

That says a lot about the site's interface, and the power of front-page presentation.</p>\n<p>When Vincent and I decided to do our own sales, my sales numbers picked up quite dramatically after a brief lag while my own promotion got folks pointed the right way (I don't know about Vincent's sales). Retailers are contacting me themselves. I sell several copies a week to individuals and just sold several dozen to retailers. I'm going to be out of this print run in a week or two.</p>\n<p>I ship anywhere for five bucks. It's not difficult or expensive to do that. When an overseas retailer buys my stuff, I charge real shipping, which is usually not onerous. Larger volume is obviously cheaper.</p>\n<p>For any retailer who only buys through IPR, you're not getting the whole picture. You're not getting Dogs in the Vineyard or Apocalypse world, and you're not getting Shock: but your customers are getting them anyway direct. If ever there were a reason to return to IPR, I'd take it. But the decreasing volume of sales coupled with the increasing percentage cut wound up not making sense for me. I appreciate that the company needs to take its percentage, and this is in no way acrimonious. But IPRs interests turned out to not be my interests. IPR wants to sell copies of lots of games. I want to sell lots of copies of <em>my</em> games.</p>\n<p>I've got no idea how one would go about rectifying that, though the "curated store" thing seems like an intriguing avenue to explore.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277505/#Comment_277505" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T10:29:51+00:00" title="June 23, 2010 10:29AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2010 10:42AM by Andy.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, this thread started as a press release. I was wondering if it would make more sense to create two splinter threads: "What do you want to see from IPR as a seller"/"What do you want to see from IPR as a buyer".  However, considering the topic shifted pretty quickly, I don't mind keeping up the rolling discussion here.<br/><br/>One thing I was curious about, though, was this:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C. Newman</cite>But the decreasing volume of sales coupled with the increasing percentage cut wound up not making sense for me. I appreciate that the company needs to take its percentage, and this is in no way acrimonious.</blockquote>\nWhy not offer the game on IPR *and* Direct? Was the increase in cut?<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>* Sell your game direct. Sell to retailers and the like only through direct sales.<br/>* At the same time, sell your game at IPR, but only to direct sales, not retailer. <br/>* And boost the price a few bucks on IPR to make up for the price (or offer amenities like the $5 shipping anywhere direct).<br/><br/>Personally, with Maid we're doing really well in a combination of IPR and direct sales: I recently cut off retailers from the book, requesting they contact us directly: Even though we weren't losing money through retailers, it just wasn't worth the extra effort to produce and keep track of so many books that wouldn't generate the same profit as direct sales. Kinda rethinking that, but that's where we're at.<br/><br/>Anyway, while the list price for the book is the same direct, I offer free shipping in the US on direct sales (rather than increase the IPR price or lower the direct price). That seems to work so far: If folks want Just Maid, they buy direct. If they want Maid and a bunch of other games to fill out an order, they buy through IPR.<br/><br/>Thoughts on something like that? Or is the direct (book) cut such that it wouldn't make it worthwhile? Or is it too much mental overhead/confusion that it's not worth bothering?<br/><br/>No judgment or anything, the world is full of options.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277521/#Comment_277521" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T11:44:16+00:00" title="June 23, 2010 11:44AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2010 11:46AM by J_Walton.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know about JACN, but these are a few of the issues I had with selling through IPR, issues that -- along with personal choices and some other stuff --- contributed to me pulling out of publishing Push in print format and ceasing to be a commercial publisher entirely, at least for now.<br/><br/>1. I priced Push very carefully for the direct market and selling to folks at conventions, so that I wouldn't be making much profit per copy and could keep the price low. In my case, this was because it mostly was a labor of love and I didn't -- and still don't, really -- want to think about what I was doing as a business.  This was a "vanity" project in that sense, for me.  But I think this same issue holds true for folks trying to keep their prices low for other, business-savvy reasons.<br/><br/>2. I was only making a few bucks a copy on Push, so when IPR started selling to retailers at a steep (but I guess standard for the industry) discount, I ended up losing money on each sale.  It wasn't a lot of money and it was counterbalanced by the bucks I was making through direct sales, so I didn't even notice for a while.  Initially, direct sales far outweighed retail sales, so the money was coming in and the hardest thing I had to worry about was calculating profits so I could pay my contributors.<br/><br/>3. However, over time, retail sales picked up as a percentage of my total sales, both as IPR was pushing that angle more (because it meant more sales for IPR, increasing their profits) and as the initial spike of direct orders -- which for me, mainly happened in the first few months after the initial release -- crested and began to decline.  Finally, I discovered that I was actually losing money on retailer orders, especially with discounted or free shipping deals and the cost of shipping books to IPR's warehouse.  Fuck.  But it was hard to know what to do at that point.  My options were basically:<br/><br/>-- pull out of IPR, because it wasn't clear to me that I could opt out of retail sales (though Ben Lehman and a few other folks told me later that they did just that)<br/>-- raise the costs across the board, because I couldn't raise the cost just for retailers, since IPR advertised their discount from the cover price<br/>-- eat the costs for the rest of the current print run and move to PDF only publishing<br/><br/>4. I ultimately decided on the latter, because I really didn't want to raise the price of the book and really didn't want to handle distribution on my own, which was the only real option if I pulled out of IPR.  The PDF ended up being released for free (with the permission of my contributors) and eventually pretty much dropped off the radar entirely, partially because I was burnt out and frustrated with the publishing process.  I didn't want to treat this as a business anyway; it was a hobby for me.  But it seemed as if it was impossible to make this sort of "vanity" or charity project work without putting a lot of time into and treating it like a business.  And, especially at that time, I wasn't prepared to do that.<br/><br/>5. At the time, IPR's push towards retail sales was very discomforting to me and I think several other member publishers.  IPR was pushing for sales that would generate basically the same amount of profits for IPR (since it took the same cut on retail and direct sales, at least as I recall) but would make much less money for the smaller independent publishers that made up the bulk of IPR's clients.  Even the big sellers like Ron, Vincent, etc. ended up moving on to another distribution model and ceasing to work with IPR, which I think indicates that NO ONE was really happy with that business direction, even the folks who stood to make the most money through distribution.  It very much seemed, and honestly still seems that way, that IPR is moving to becoming much more like a traditional distributor and losing a lot of the personal touches and dedication to publishers that it was previously known for.  And maybe that was necessary -- then and now -- to make IPR profitable, but I think it lost a lot of love in the process, which is unfortunate.<br/><br/>So, overall, there were a lot of mistakes and misconceptions on my side, as a first-time publisher, and I take responsibility for those, but in the end the experience left me wondering if it was even worth bothering with print publishing at all, which is pretty unfortunate.  I wish there had been more resources and communication with publishers about the direction that IPR was moving and tools and advice for making us all more prepared and on-board with that.  Even with all of IPR's recent success, I look back on what was lost along the way, especially the products and publishers that no longer work with IPR, and wonder if it was worth it.<br/><br/>P. S. The other thing that bothered me about IPR at the time, as opposed to doing distribution on your own, was that there was zero contact between publishers and the folks buying our games, which is not really how the indie community has traditionally worked.  Generally, most designers welcome contact and interactions with the folks buying their games and, while the VOR podcast and a couple other outreach efforts were cool, I really just wanted an email list of people interested in my products, even if there was an option to sign out of that when making orders.  Not feeling like I knew who was buying my product felt really wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277584/#Comment_277584" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T15:25:59+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  3:25PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2010 3:26PM by Simon_Rogers.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

It means that it's not just a decision about money. As a publisher, I also have to make decisions about giving my business to a company whose interests are sometimes at odds with mine, and sometimes at odds with my fellow publishers'. It's an ethical, or ideological, or at least business-mission-ical decision too. "Is IPR a good value for the price?" and also "does giving IPR my business align with my goals as a publisher?"<br/><br/>I think that IPR is neat and good. IPR carries my wife's game, for goodness sake, and it causes us no strife whatsoever. <br/><br/>I think that the circumstance we find ourselves in, where IPR can presume itself to be an essential middleman, is <i>terrible</i>.

IPR had the best (read, cheapest) shipping options of any distributor out there.</blockquote>\nReally? Maybe things have changed, but historically the only time I have been able to justify ordering from IPR has been when I could go through a local games store and have them eat the S&amp;H costs for me (how this worked out to anyone's advantage besides mine, I do not know, but I hope it did.) Every game I have ordered through some other online distributor has had cheaper shipping -- usually direct from the publisher. It may have been slower or less reliable but it was always fast and reliable enough.<br/><br/>I think Eero is spot on, though Paul put it much more succinctly. There is real value in someone else winnowing through the enormous selection of games and offering me a specific, identifiable slice to choose from. For me, IPR has gone from a destination whose editorial selection I took seriously to 'some place I would go if that was the only place to get the book.' Maybe there is room for an amazon.com of indie games, maybe not, but that's what it is for me right now -- I used to browse IPR for new cool games, but the combination of the web design (as Jonathan points out, correctly, it is pretty bad for browsing) and the editorial direction make that unfeasible.<br/><br/>And I mean, there obviously is some curation/editorial choices being made, so it is entirely possible that it has simply moved away from what I like -- but my feeling is it has simply become diluted.

I seem to remember that customers can write reviews for the games, for instance - or at least there's an option for that in the cart software, no idea how much it is used, if at all.<br/><br/>For my part I don't really see any way of making the IPR webshopping interface more effective as <i>marketing</i> without increasing the amount of editorial commitment - categorizing product, characterizing product, having opinions about the product, it's all the same. If the politically correct principle is to have no opinions and no recommendations aside from "many other drones bought this thing, you buy it too!", then the customer is unlikely to find much value from using the webstore in any but the most utilitarian manner: type the name of the game you're looking for in the search bar and get out. Of course changing anything takes work, too, and somebody has to carry that burden, so it might not be worthwhile for IPR.<br/><br/>The question that was asked earlier in the thread is still current, though - should IPR be appealing for destination shopping, or is it proper and desirable for it to be "merely" reliable, impartial and professional? Is it IPR's job to attract customers for me, or is it my job to attract them for IPR? I don't have any difficulty answering this question for my fulfillment service, but when it comes to a webstore and convention presence, the issue becomes more difficult. Luckily I see IPR in those roles basically as a retailer - even as I'm willing to make suggestions as a curious individual, I don't really have a stake in whether the IPR marketing efforts are effective or not. The only real issue for a client is whether the cut IPR skims from sales is worth the services provided; if the IPR webstore and convention presence are inefficient due to brand dilution, that makes it more difficult for IPR and its clients to find an agreeable fee structure. This isn't as much of an issue for me as it is for many other authors, as the main selling point IPR has for me as a foreigner is its logistical ability to handle my stock; folks able to handle their own fulfillment in the USA have a much more difficult calculation to make with IPR, I imagine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277680/#Comment_277680" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T10:08:30+00:00" title="June 24, 2010 10:08AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

The top ten list and hottest item is actually a very small amount of the page, but it does seem to have an effect.  To be frank, it's something we've been advocating for for some time. This will involve changes to the front page which involves adjusting the weighting of publishers (as publishers) against volume.More proactive management will make a big difference. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/ndp">@ndp</a> I'ts very straightforward to get emails. Dead easy in fact. You can find out who has bought what in under a minute if you have excel. The search utility is not good, and having separate entries for PDF, Print and PDF and Print is problematic. However, you have to know how to do it, and it's not obvious or friendly for publishers at the moment. I think where IPR has fallen down the most (perhaps through benign neglect) is in its failure to build the sense of community required to make review tools and forums useful - almost entirely for technological reasons.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">@fnord3125</a> There are such lists, and we've tried to encourage publishers to make their own.

I'd like to offer some perspective from one of the smallest publishers represented by IPR, since it hasn't seemed like there's been much of that.<br/><br/>First - being in Canada means that I'm with IPR for good. If I ever finish the revised edition of Thou Art But A Warrior, I'll probably migrate Canadian sales to the Un-Store and do that fulfillment myself. However, for all sales outside Canada, here's why IPR just makes more sense for me:<br/><br/>* Canada Post blows for shipping anywhere outside Canada. Speaking from painful personal experience, I'd lose too much money on lost/destroyed items if I attempted to do my own fulfillment to destinations outside of Canada. <br/>* The cost of mailing things outside of Canada would probably cost me sales as well. Canada Post rates are not cheap, and who wants to pay 60% of the cost of a book in shipping?<br/>* A huge percentage of my sales are to European retailers that have an established relationship with IPR. I don't want to jeopardize the few sales a month I'm seeing and risk losing some of those sales, since I'd wind up with the fun of shipping things from Canada to the US times about three. No thanks.<br/>* Shipping aside, I just can't make it to cons to sell my games. If I'm lucky, I make it to one con a year - GenCon. So just for the convention sales, having games with IPR is a no-brainer.<br/><br/>(NECESSARY INTERNET DISCLAIMER: Before I go any further, I KNOW that I wrote a game that is fraught with emotional/religious/political/racial issues. I KNOW that it's a supplement. I never expected this thing to sell eleventy billion copies. Whatever.)<br/><br/>That being said, I can't say that I'm happy with the representation that my game has gotten through IPR either at conventions or on the website. Last year I was lucky enough to be in the Pirate Jenny booth at GenCon, and my experience of selling games outside the IPR booth didn't give me a whole lot of confidence in the representation that those us at the bottom of the sales list are getting. The following scenario happened several times throughout the convention: customers came to our booth straight from the IPR booth and were delighted that we could not only give full 2-minute pitches for each of the twelve games on our shelves, but could run demos for about half of them on the spot. They would then make dissatisfied comments about how the people at the IPR booth couldn't even give informed elevator pitches about the vast majority of the catalog. <br/><br/>And I have to say this mirrors my experience with selling games at the IPR/Forge booth in 2008. In 2008, I was baffled by the fact that despite closely following a host of new games in development, I was only familiar with a little less than 50% of the books on the shelves. In 2007, I could have given elevator pitches for 75% of the games that IPR brought! This year I'd be hard pressed to identify more than 30%. The IPR catalog is just too big for any one person's brain to contain, which is unfortunate because it means that a lot of games out on the fringes don't get a lot of attention since people staffing the booth tend to direct people's attention toward books they know. Which is understandable - who wants to sound like a jackass? <br/><br/>Similarly, as a small publisher of a fringe game, I feel very underserved by IPR's website in terms of promotion. Even during the first brief initial sales blitz when I sold almost 50 copies in a month, I never once cracked the top 25. TABAW was linked to from the front page for about a week as a new game, but once it was gone it was gone never to appear again. <br/><br/>And again, I'll say this aligns pretty closely with my expectations. I'm coming close to having sold 200 copies, which is pretty good for a supplement that makes people uncomfortable. I understand that some games have limited appeal. But all the same, it feels like us publishers at the bottom of the sales list can only ever expect IPR to be a fulfillment service and nothing else. We're not getting the promotion love that the biggest games get on the website, and we definitely don't get pitched at conventions. Aside from one or two IPR staffers, most people at the booth at GenCon are there to <i>sell their own games</i>. Not my games, not your games. <i>Their games</i>.<br/><br/>I understand that much of this is a fuction of the now ridonkulous size of IPR's catalog, and I realize that not all of us can be Luke Crane or Vincent Baker. (And I'm certainly not trying to claim that if IPR wasn't "holding me back" that I could be selling eleventy billion games. Good lord, no.) But still, I have to say that I do regret the fact that being a Canadian publisher has limited my fulfillment options. Doing ALL of my own fulfillment would be time-consuming, true. But if I was an American publisher, I have to think that the value that I get out of IPR might not be equal to the inconvenience of fulfilling orders myself.<br/><br/>I like IPR, and as an indie company I want it to succeed. But my feelings about how IPR is serving me are pretty ambivalent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277719/#Comment_277719" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T14:13:34+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  2:13PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wundergeek</cite><br/><br/>And again, I'll say this aligns pretty closely with my expectations. I'm coming close to having sold 200 copies, which is pretty good for a supplement that makes people uncomfortable. I understand that some games have limited appeal. But all the same, it feels like us publishers at the bottom of the sales list can only ever expect IPR to be a fulfillment service and nothing else. We're not getting the promotion love that the biggest games get on the website, and we definitely don't get pitched at conventions. Aside from one or two IPR staffers, most people at the booth at GenCon are there to<i>sell their own games</i>. Not my games, not your games.<i>Their games</i>.<br/></blockquote>\nThis, right here, is why I was saying I'd love to see a skinnable storefront that publishers could embed in their websites that fulfilled via IPR. I appreciate the promotion that IPR HAS done for Two Scooters Press games; we're not top sellers, but Mist-Robed Gate and It's Complicated have both been featured on the podcast. I totally understand that there simply isn't the screen space or the mindshare to promote every single title, which is why I'd love to be able to promote 2SP titles for IPR myself.<br/><br/>I've never once considered IPR as a promotional tool and, until this thread, it honestly never occurred to me that some people do, or want it to be one. I think its main value to small publishers is as a fulfillment service, and that's what I'm willing to pay for. I just want it to be a better fulfillment service for my needs, which means customizable, embeddable, with only the products that belong to my imprint.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277737">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277737/#Comment_277737" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T16:02:50+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  4:02PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Elizabeth, could it be something like more control over individual publisher's pages?

It reminds me that I've got to get the PDF for IC Revised up there. Here's a quick list of what I'd want to have the option to do.<br/><br/>- Brand the page to fit the scheme of my website. (Bonus points for being able to literally embed it.) The colors are all wrong, and if I linked to IPR's publisher page for 2SP, it's obvious that the link goes to a different website.<br/>     -I want to be able to link to multiple specific pages on my website from my publisher page without resorting to a text link in every product description.<br/><br/>- Right now, the 2SP logo competes with the IPR logo and with Out of the Box, the eye doesn't know where to go. The only place that links to my website is the logo, and that's not even explicit. <br/><br/>- I don't want people to come to my page and get hit with a bunch of tabs for other products; the eye gets fidgety, and I want to increase the likelihood that if their mouse finger gets itchy, they're going to click on something that brings them closer to buying MY game than to falling down the IPR rabbithole. If they're looking at my publisher page, my stuff is what brought them there in the first place!<br/>     - I wouldn't mind something noticeable but unobtrusive that linked back to the IPR mainpage, but there shouldn't be more non-2SP links on my page than 2SP links.<br/><br/>- And since we're talking wishes here, I'd love to be able to pay a one-time setup fee for the chance to do this (A "Platinum service" tier, or something, I don't know), which would come with a lowered IPR cut. The reasons the cuts are so high, as I've been told, is the cost of shipping books to conventions and promotional costs and whatnot. Well, if I'm doing the promoting, and I go to most of the cons IPR attends, I'm more than willing to give them a flat fee for the flat amount of promotional consideration they're giving me in allowing me to skin their site, and just pay them for the fulfillment. <br/><br/>- Also a pony.<br/><br/><br/>But seriously, as is, I don't want to send potential customers to IPR because they'll never find their way back to my stuff. I could spend a ton of time setting up a professional-looking webstore on my own, but if I do that, you can bet the links will be to direct purchases instead of a place that gets a seriously high commission on my work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277744">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277744/#Comment_277744" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T16:54:26+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  4:54PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still keep stock and a pdf available at IPR, and I just finally set up an unstore page, after I realized the link on my website to purchase SAJ directly from me was broken. Like Anna's game, Steal Away Jordan is a fringe-make-you-uncomfortable game, which makes it difficult to promote to the general gamer audience. Add to that, I don't have the energy to promote my game as much as I would like, or maybe should. At this point, I'm trying to finish two games (one of which has been in [agonizingly slow] progress for two years), start another, and I have two other writing projects. My intention now is to build a foundation of work and promote that, rather than just push Steal Away Jordan. <br/><br/>I don't sell much on IPR, which, after three years, is okay by me (see above). In the past year I've sold more copies of Steal Away Jordan to educators and colleagues that my mom meets at academic symposia than I have through IPR. I'm loathe to say it, because SAJ is not supposed to be an educational game, but that's where it seems to be going. If I put more energy into it, I could probably make better use of the space I have on the IPR site, and be able to justify the fees better to myself. For the time being,  It'd be nice if the designer's page was more customizable, but I have a website and a Facebook page for that, I suppose. <br/><br/>Really, what works for me with IPR is that my game goes to brick and mortar retailers. It doesn't generate me much cash, but at this point in Steal Away Jordan's life, I'm happy to see it get into to people's hands, and insh' on their tables for play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277755/#Comment_277755" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T18:16:52+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  6:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2010 6:17PM by wundergeek.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Elizabeth</cite>The reasons the cuts are so high, as I've been told, is the cost of shipping books to conventions and promotional costs and whatnot.

I like tinkering with websites anyway, so why not. Could be somewhat complex to implement technically, though, as IPR has traditionally been pretty hide-bound and tied to its particular shopping cart tech (perfectly understandable for an understaffed half-hobby operation, note) - seems difficult to envision a shift to a totally different paradigm that'd separate the store interface from fulfillment tracking, which something like this would require. Presumably customizable storefronts at the IPR site would be simpler tech-wise, but integration with the publisher's own site and total opaqueness of the IPR backend would necessitate implementing arbitrarily accessible client interface into the store database and the fulfillment queue, however that is implemented in practice. It's not impossible technologically (pretty simple, in fact), but it's so different from the current set-up that it'd probably require redoing the whole site with a different software.<br/><br/>Alternative storefronts in general are relatively simple in comparison when it comes to the tech, at least assuming that the shopping cart solution separates the logic from style appropriately. If the software has no support whatsoever for something like that, it might require a bit of inventiveness to get several applications to share a single database. Still, nothing that isn't done in the Internet often enough. Could involve some unexpected bugs, of course, but the basic principle of duplicating the software routines and allowing them to operate over the same data in parallel is simple enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277802/#Comment_277802" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T06:47:04+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  6:47AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2010 6:49AM by wundergeek.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon Rogers</cite>Those costs are bourne directly by those companies which are represented at conventions, and that is reflected in the margin on sales at conventions.

My issue is that if I choose to send my game to a con, I don't really have any confidence that it's going to be represented well or at all by people staffing the booth. This is a difficult issue for me because cons do get extra sales for books if they are well represented. Last year at the Pirate Jenny booth, I sold 15 copies - which is three or four times my monthly average! Will it be worth it to send my game to GenCon this year? I'm honestly not sure. I'd like to, but I can't attend GenCon this year and I don't have a whole lot of confidence that my game is going to be well spoken-for if it goes there without me.<br/><br/>I understand the reasons why this happens for all the reasons stated above in my first post. I'm not trying to point fingers and say that the people staffing the booth are horrible awful people for not knowing about all the weird little fringe games at the bottom of the list. I'm simply trying to put forward a perspective from someone who has written a weird little fringe game. Bell curves being what they are, there's a lot of us that you probably haven't heard from.<br/><br/>I like the idea of IPR and want it to succeed because it's something that the community needed and without it I dare say that a good many of us never would have bothered to publish in the first place. Certainly the relationships that IPR developed with retailers have forged new ground. I'd say that without IPR, it wouldn't be possible for publishers like Joshua to market his games directly to retailers. These are fantastic reasons to like IPR as an idea, but IPR isn't just an idea it's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a business</span>. The fact of the matter is that now that IPR has broken this new ground in alerting retailers to indie products, this has only made it possible for those unhappy with the return for their dollar that they are getting in terms of service from IPR to leave IPR and strike out on their own.<br/><br/>I've talked with a lot of game designers about this in the past year, and I have to say that there's an undercurrent of dissatisfaction with IPR among many of the designers that I've talked to - not all of them, but a statistically significant proportion of people that I have conversed with on this matter. I know that Danielle chose to release Kagematsu independent of IPR or any fulfillment service, and I know that a lot of new designers publishing for the first time are choosing to do the same thing. When I look at the increasing popularity of the Un-Store as a mode of connecting game buyers directly with publishers, I have to think that this is a signal that IPR needs to pay attention to. IPR isn't the only show in town anymore, and indie gaming is an <i>indie</i> movement. <br/><br/>Vincent may have gotten the ball rolling with the Un-Store, but history has proven that we're not a group of people who are afraid to innovate. If the people who feel they are being underserved by IPR feel that IPR is not listening or responding to their concerns, most of them will leave. This includes publishers of weird little fringe games like mine, but it <i>also</i> includes small publishers whose games just haven't managed to garner the buzz needed to put them on people's radar in the first place. Furthermore, because most indie games are not designed in a vacuum, it's my opinion that this will have a ripple effect and make more first-time publishers seriously consider taking fulfillment and retail sales into their own hands.<br/><br/>It seems like IPR has a choice - to become a stable for the the largest and most successful indie games, or to try and address some of these concerns and maintain the depth and scope of its catalog that is currently its biggest asset as well as perhaps being its biggest hindrance.<br/><br/>I'm not saying this as someone who hates IPR and wants it to fail. Being a Canadian publisher means that I'm in with IPR for the long haul. As such, I have a vested interest in seeing IPR succeed! Neither am I claiming to have all the answers. I am simply trying to present a point of view that has been underrepresented and trying to do so in a manner that will not get dismissed out of hand as more IPR-bashing - hence the numerous disclaimers and attempts to soften my language, this here being Teh Intardnets. I do hope that these comments are at least heard and considered rather than being dismissed.<br/><br/>(EDIT: For bad spelling and grammar)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

If you can get other people to intermarket, then awesome. You can both cover twice the ground. That's synergy. But remember: the way the indie game model works is that you <em>sell with your sincere enthusiasm</em>. Fred can't get sincerely enthusiastic about every game the way he does for a FATE hack. It's not fair, reasonable, or practical to expect that from him.</p>\n<p>IPR is not the answer to your marketing challenges. <strong>You are.</strong> You can <em>use</em> IPR to address particular ones, but IPR can not possibly be the core of your marketing scheme.</p>\n<p>Here, let's look at the all-time bestsellers from the site:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<ol>\n<li>Spirit of the Century (Fred's a marketing powerhouse. He's infectiously enthusiastic.)</li>\n<li>Houses of the Blooded [PDF] (John Wick has been doing this stuff for a looong time.)</li>\n<li>Don't Rest Your Head (Again, with the Fred)</li>\n<li>Spirit of the Century [Print+PDF] (Ahem.)</li>\n<li>Dread (Dread has an amazing cover, totally unique mechanism, and a bombastic and fun designer who plays it at cons, not to mention a frequent mention by the Geek Nights guys.)</li>\n<li>Polaris (Ask Ben where he puts IPR in his marketing scheme. I'm sure it plays a very particular part.)</li>\n<li>Wild Talents Essential Edition (I've seen Greg Stolze wearing a sandwich board in support of his games.)</li>\n<li>Three Sixteen: Carnage Among the Stars (This took off at the Design Matters booth because John Harper loved it so much.)</li>\n<li>REIGN [Softcover] (This is the game Greg was sandwiched in, if I recall)</li>\n<li>Mouse Guard Roleplaying Game [Print+PDF] (Luke doesn't have weekends. He has conventions.)</li>\n<li>Maid : The Role-Playing Game [PDF] (Andy promoted this for years with his krewe.)</li>\n<li>Trail of Cthulhu (Kenneth has made a name for himself by publishing tons of stuff about things people care about)</li>\n</ol>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>What you will note here is that IPR is <em>part</em> of these guys' marketing. They're not <em>relying</em> on IPR to do it for them. Because IPR can't.</p>\n<p>No one is as interested in your success as you. If your game flounders and dies and never sees a second hundred print run, IPR will find someone else. But you care. You want it to happen. You're the one who has to go to cons and schedule games, make your website work, find every way to sell, figure out your price point, and deal with irate customers. In response, <em>you're</em> the one who will get to meet new players at games, have a refined and interactive website that facilitates communication with your customers, be able to sell in unusual situations, get a good percentage for your work, and then have enthusiastic players telling all their friends about you and your games.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/boulet" title="boulet"><img alt="boulet" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/nTWF4B3HT5CT6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/boulet">boulet</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277820/#Comment_277820" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T08:15:45+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  8:15AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just a customer.

Not only that, some of those comments are themselves comments on how others do things. (Not to mention some of these posts to me seem to say things and then go against their stated goals with their measures, but hey, that's allowed too...)<br/><br/>I think what you can ask for is that each person who speaks as a publisher will only speak of their own experience, and not comment on others'.*<br/><br/>Also, don't forget, I think in the end it might be just as important, or even more, to hear people's experience as buyers; in this context. I'm not splitting it into "Consumers" and "Designers", because most designers probably buy as well ;-)<br/><br/>I used to visit IPR quite often, look at the "What's New" section on the front page, and then visit again in a month, knowing it's enough. It's no longer enough, and to put it bluntly, I don't care for most of what's on the front page either. But that's totally subjective.<br/>The last time I went through the whole friggin' catalogue it had something like 20(?) pages. I don't see myself doing it again. The double and triple listing for book, PDF and bundles is indeed quite annoying.<br/><br/>As for shipping, I also order from eBay, so I know how it is, and that the automatic calculators give results that are not true, but it's still chaffing to pay, well, not a lot, but considerably more than is on the shipping sticker. I haven't ordered recently from IPR so it might have changed, but shipping costs figures heavily in this.<br/>Also, items' weights are SERIOUSLY off. Like, by a 2 (or higher? I weighed some books once, it's been a while) multiplier in many cases. I dunno, is the weight listed plus packaging? Because then you pay the shipping for 3 packages you don't get when you buy 4 books, not to mention there's rarely any packaging to mention aside from the envelope, so I don't really see it. Handling? Well, it's expensive handling, and it doesn't change the fact that the weight listed is way off.<br/><br/>* Edit: I think being nice is all good, but the point picked is already too late, and allows for too many unpleasantries as it is. I am not sure it's actually better to stop there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277888/#Comment_277888" name="Item_103" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T12:56:43+00:00" title="June 25, 2010 12:56PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So here's a situation that has actual practical meaning for me, and I'm trying to figure out how to deal with it.<br/><br/>I like running games at conventions, and there are a couple New England conventions that have a broad diversity of games that I'd like to see more story games represented at.  This is sort of an evangelist attitude, but what I'd really like is to be able to run a game of, say, Fiasco, and be able to say, "Hey, if you liked this, the dealer just to the right as you go into the dealers' room has it in stock!"  Now, if I run four games that are all available from IPR, that means that that dealer has one phone call to make and one vendor to work with, and the vendor already has a standard distributor contract.  If I run four games that are available only from the Unstore, that means that that dealer has to call up four different vendors and negotiate rates with each one of them.  <br/><br/>And to make this Real:  I'm scheduled to run In A Wicked Age at OGC-Con the last weekend in July, and if any of the players catches on fire because of it, I want him to be able to take a copy home, so that it becomes "this cool game we can play" instead of staying "that cool game I played that one time."  And I'm trying to figure out how best to do that -- ordering six copies myself and selling them at cost?  Alerting the con vendors ahead of time so that they can stock it themselves? <br/><br/>(When I started this, it was solidly in the "DOJ &amp; IPR" thread; it seems to want to bud off and be its own thing now.  Maybe I'll start a thread on applying the marketing techniques of mass-market RPGs to indie game evangelism next.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277894/#Comment_277894" name="Item_104" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T13:08:01+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  1:08PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good to hear, Graham!  <br/><br/>As a consumer, I almost never search or browse at IPR.

Actually it didn't. It went down. Well, maybe sideways...<br/><br/>It used to be that IPR published a figure of 15% for its commission on sales. But when you got your payout there were various other deductions added on, like the cost of credit card processing and stuff to do with shipping. Those elements were essentially unpredictable, which made it a lot harder to set prices so that you were sure of making a reasonable amount on each sale. On mine it was working out somewhere in the region of 30%, IIRC.<br/><br/>A few of us made noises about this, and IPR management came up with the current commission structure, which has the mighty benefit to publishers that you know exactly what to expect. This was a major change to the way they were doing things, and I think involved them taking on more risk, so they got some brownie points from me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278379/#Comment_278379" name="Item_107" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-28T15:06:40+00:00" title="June 28, 2010  3:06PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2010 10:18AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It would be very helpful if IPR publishers on this thread posted their gripes and suggestions on the IPR mail list, too, and perhaps if there are disgruntled third parties you know of, you could prod them to do the same.

They sell and promote your stuff.<br/><br/>If IPR were (also) to act as a plain fulfilment house, and there's no reason technical reason they couldn't, who would be taking the orders? If want them to fulfil your orders, you'd be charged warehousing and S&amp;H, and be responsible for communications. You wouldn't share any shipping costs with other publishers shipping to the same customer. Speak to the guys if this is what you want. They might be interested. If they are not, I can put you in touch with my guy, who'd be glad of the business and is reasonably priced.<br/><br/>I don't think a store front model with a fixed price per unit is feasible for IPR. The problem with a fixed fee per unit instead of a (low) percentage is that is would disproportionately hit the smaller publishers with lower priced products. The current model means larger publishers with more expensive products and a greater pull tend to support and reduce the costs of the smaller one. A fixed price would be harsh for them. Fees tend to relate quite closely to price-per-unit, so it's a pretty good model. How much of a share would be fair for promotion? For server fees? <br/><br/>I'm not sure if you trying to make a helpful suggestion here, or just pointing out why IPR is bad for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_278560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278560/#Comment_278560" name="Item_110" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T12:40:43+00:00" title="June 29, 2010 12:40PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seems clear to me that Joshua's just explaining why IPR doesn't work for him. I can see how the proportionate fees can be seen as distasteful - they detach the IPR workload and expenses from their rewards, making IPR a commission retailer instead of hired help for the publisher. Nothing wrong with that if the combination works for you, of course.<br/><br/>Perhaps it would be worthwhile for IPR to explore alternative client models, such as allowing sales channels other than its own main website. As it is, selling through IPR is effectively retail sales - the best the publisher can do to facilitate is to tell the customer that he should go to this IPR webstore to get his game. This works fine for those who aren't in it for the direct sales, but some like the advantages of communicating directly with your customer base and making the commercial transaction personal, so that the customer knows to come back to them for further business, and so their customer relationship has an opaque back-end - the customer doesn't need to know where you stock and who does your fulfillment, those are all functions IPR reveals by the virtue of its webstore model of operations.<br/><br/>A potential problem in any alternative sales channels that affect the IPR profit sharing model is that they cause competition that might be found distasteful. For instance, if I'm given an opportunity to hook up my own orders page into the IPR fulfillment system and I'm told that IPR only takes 15% instead of 35% out of any sales (or whatever) I can cause through my own orders page, that'll reduce my interest in marketing IPR as a venue sharply - my links to buying my game no longer go to IPR. This sort of thing would ultimately reduce the value of IPR as a store to its owners, considering how the best marketing IPR has comes from the fact that there are dozens of indie publishers out there marketing their own game and directing customers to IPR.<br/><br/>For my own part I don't have a particular problem with the retail nature of IPR per se. It's a good deal for the retailer and customer who want to buy many things from a set of closely associated publishers, much easier than buying them separately one by one. The model does cause what is effectively a subvention of passive and slow marketing schemes among the publishers to a degree: IPR gets the same cut regardless of whether the publisher drives customers to the IPR or if the sales only happen accidentally or even due to IPR's marketing efforts. Thus the "easy money" IPR gets from fulfilling popular titles goes in part into the expenses of warehousing and marketing slow moving stuff. Same as any retailer, except the publishers have a stake in the proceedings, too, due to the commission sales model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_278678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/reaction" title="reaction"><img alt="reaction" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/reaction">reaction</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/278678/#Comment_278678" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-29T21:48:58+00:00" title="June 29, 2010  9:48PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.
