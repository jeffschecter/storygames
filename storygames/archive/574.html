                    I like settings I can engage with. Usually, that means settings that are familiar to me (cities, farms, universities) or ones that spark my imagination (moon bases, castles).<br/>
<br/>
Now, many American game designers use contemporary American settings for their game: high schools, malls, American highways, distinctively American suburbs.  Usually, the setting is barely detailed, because it's assumed that American readers will be familiar with it.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, I often get the feeling that the designer is using a generic American setting as a sort of default. He's assuming that readers know the setting, so he doesn't need to detail it.<br/>
<br/>
I can't engage with these settings. They're neither familiar to me nor interesting. So I don't buy those games.<br/>
<br/>
And I find this a great shame. By giving me a generic setting, the designer's missed a huge opportunity  to give me a richer one. What <i>kind</i> of American highway is it? Is it dusty and endless or modern and soulless? What kind of high school? Bitchy or gritty?<br/>
<br/>
Note that what I'm <i>not</i> saying here is that I feel "excluded" (as per a recent thread). I'm not saying: make your settings less American so that they're accessible to me.<br/>
<br/>
What I'm saying is: if you use an American setting, describe it to me. Don't assume I know what it's like: tell me. Make it rich enough so I can play with it.<br/>

                            Can you point me to some of the "generic American setting" games that you're thinking of?  I might or might not have something useful to say, but I'd rather poke at the games first and see if that helps me turn my vague ideas into something a little more concrete.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>--Jess                        </br></br></div>

<p>I visited England twice and went on a couple road trips, so I can put your mind at ease on at least one point: American and British highways are shockingly the same. There are minor details, which designers should probably sketch out, as you say, and there are a few things that require translation (Hardees = RoadChef, because so many of them are used as bus stops and they have about the same quality food.)</p>
<p>Oh, and Americans have cloverleafs and interchanges instead of roundabouts.</p>
<p>Other settings should definitely get more detail. Every American designer thinks their town and experiences are "generic", but America is <em>huge</em>, and not the same everywhere, despite the monotonizing factor of the media.</p>
<p>That brings up another point. Many games that claim to be set in a "typical" high school or "typical" small town (or whatever) are really drawing their setting from one or more films, tv shows, or other media. Designers should just <em>say</em> that. It's an easier reference point, even for non-Americans. If I tell you "<em>Hughes High</em> is a game set in a typical high school found in the typical teen romantic comedy, like 'Breakfast Club', "Weird Science', or 'Sixteen Candles'," it's a lot easier for you to know what I'm talking about.</p>

                            Jess,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that's a good question. OK. I should point out that I really like all the games I'm going to mention in this post.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, a game that does an American setting <i>really well</i> is Dogs In The Vineyard. I've never been to that area of the States but, after reading the descriptive text, I can picture the setting completely: the sunlight, the landscape, what the air tastes like.<br/>
<br/>
The first time I thought about generic American settings was during the first round of the Ronnies (Ron Edwards' game competition). One of the keywords for that contest was "suburb" and I remember many games set in typical American suburbs. Even a superbly gritty game like <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/The_Suburban_Crucible.php" rel="nofollow">The Suburban Crucible</a> seemed to be set in a <i>generic</i> suburb, where I would have preferred it set in a realistic, affluent suburb.<br/>
<br/>
In the latest round of Game Chef, I rather liked <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Ancient_Committee_is_an_Emo_Band.php" rel="nofollow">Ancient Committee Is An Emo Band</a>, but it also seemed set in a generic high-school / teenage environment. Setting this game in a bitchy LA high school or a grungy Seattle high school could, I feel, really give focus to this game.<br/>
<br/>
(And perhaps the game is designed to be played in either of these high schools. That's fine, but in that case, I'd like some guidance on designing the setting)<br/>
<br/>
<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Merryweather.php" rel="nofollow">Merryweather</a> has a deeply evocative setting and, after reading it, I get a strong picture of the lake and the mansion mentioned in the introduction. However, I don't get a clear picture of the town of Merryweather. I think it's an sterilised, idealised fifties town, but I'm not totally sure. And the characters are described as average high school students: but I'm not sure whether they're Buffy students or Harry Potter students.<br/>
<br/>
And <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.1km1kt.net/rpg/Crime_and_Punishment.php" rel="nofollow">Crime And Punishment</a> is a superb game. It seems to be set in generic TV police drama territory. That's fine, and would probably work very well for the game, but, if I played it, I'd want to set it in Fargo or the Chicago of VI Warshawski. What I'm not getting, from the game text, is a feeling that I know what I would see when I walk out of the police station.<br/>
<br/>
(Brand and John: I think you've raised good points and I don't have much to add to them, really)<br/>

                            Silly question, but could this be an artifact of <i>Dogs</i> being a complete, published game and the others having been written and designed in a short period of time?

No, that's a really good question. I'd argue those games have <i>generic</i> settings, not that the settings aren't fleshed out enough yet. Each of the game texts describes a setting which, to me, appears to be generic, in one way or another.<br/>
<br/>
(By the way, since these games are in development, I'm hoping that the authors will see this as useful criticism, even if they think I'm wrong).<br/>

                            This is an interesting topic.<br><br>Perhaps some designers make assumptiosn based on marketing considerations - if you only have so many words, and most of your audience is American, maybe you cut the detail you assume they know.  <br><br>I regularly game with a German dude, and his childhood intake of American television seems to have put him in good stead - he's never missed a beat as a hard-boiled gumshoe, a cowboy, a patriotic boxer, a sharp New York lawyer, etc.  I'm not sure how deep this goes, but from my perspective it's pretty convincing.  <br><br>Conversely, I've totally experienced what you describe - playing English characters, or German ones, adds an intriguing bit of cognitive dissonance as I try to parley my limited experience with your abhorrent, un-American Euro-cultures into something fun and honest.  <br><br>I'm curious, Graham, how do you feel about The Roach?  Because there's very little setting there, and I short-handed the tweedy New England idiom I know, primarily, from stuff like Horse Feathers and The Halls of Ivy (and bitter personal experience in academia, of course).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<blockquote>I think Jess has a strong hold on it. Someone working under a severe time constraint is going to cut all the corners he feels he can afford to lose.</blockquote>
My feeling is that it's not a question of cutting corners. I think that many designers, especially in game competitions, opt for a generic setting.<br><br>Now, perhaps the generic setting will often be abandoned in later development. If so, that's a useful thing to identify.  It's useful to be able to say: "We understand you're using a generic setting for now but, if this game goes any further, you'll need a better one".<br><br>I think that you and Jess are arguing that, as the game gets developed, the generic setting naturally gets abandoned. And, yes, I can't think of many published games with generic settings. So perhaps you're right.<br><br>But perhaps the cause and effect works the other way? Perhaps the games with interesting settings are the ones which get published. Perhaps games with generic settings never spark enough interest to get developed, unless the setting is changed.
<blockquote>Personally, I have no problems working with settings that leave me, as GM, with plenty of room to fill in the gaps. I *like* filling in the gaps.</blockquote>
Yes, I agree with that. I do too.<br><br>But, for me, there's a difference between a generic setting:<br><br><i>"This game is set in a typical American high school"</i><br><i>"This game is set in your basic, average American high school"</i><br><br>and a setting which lets me fill in the gaps:<br><br><i>"This game can be set in any American high school you like. Choose a location. Choose how affluent the area is."<br>"Imagine the worst American high school ever. That's the setting for this game."<br/>"This game is set in a high school just like the one you went to"</br></i><br/><br/>The first set shut down my imagination. The second set open it up.

Well, the Roach is set in a tweedy, political academic environment.  That's a beautifully rich setting and not generic at all. <br/>
<br/>
I can picture it: it's got courtyards and very old buildings. I can't remember whether they were described in the text, but that's what I imagine. (By the way, for me, the Roach is set in Oxford or Cambridge).<br/>
<br/>
If it was in "An ordinary American University", that would be a very generic setting. <br/>

<p>Hiya Graham,</p>
<p>I've been really pondering your initial post there, man.  First, I totally agree; Saying 'Generic American' <em>anything</em> isn't evocative at all for me.  I mean, America is way to varied for applying anything generic in a storygame.  At least, nothing that's important to the game.</p>
<p>But dude... there's just <em>no way</em> I could make my games any less American.  I spent one year in Germany when I was 9 and occationally visited Montreal as I was growing up.  On the other hand, I've lived in New York, California, Texas, Utah, Mississippi, Massachusetts, and now, North Carolina.  I think it would be simply impossible for me to write a game that's directed at an audience outside of where I've grown up.  I think the same thing applies for everyone, really.</p>
<p>I totally dig what you're saying about describing what I'm talking about for a wider audience.  But, there's some situations where that would be just... well, a bit too tedious.  Like a mall, for instance.  If I were to describe the setting as "In a modern yuppie shopping mall.", would that do anything for you?  'Cuz it means an awful lot to me.</p>
<p>And I think that leads me to my real point.  Most, if not all, of us here are just beginning to be RPG designers.  We've gotta design for <em>us</em>, not for a market that we may or may not ever reach.  So, yeah, while I appreciate the idea that I've gotta be evocative in my design, I cannot let myself worry about how well someone from a different continent or culture will recieve my design.  I've got to make sure that it evokes for me first.  Maybe later I can worry about things like that.  Probably lots later.</p>
<p>-Eric</p>

                            Graham, I guess I have no trouble reading "A typical American High School" as "The High School you grew up in."<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in an affluent, uppermiddleclass, suburban Connecticut high school where the people came in two colors... white and lily-white.  It had commonalities with other high schools (there was a serious alcohol problem) and differences (our pregnancy rate was the highest in the state, yes, higher than Bridgeport and Hartford, we had a pool, our football team was one of the best in the state) but I think a "typical" high school would always have commonalities and differences.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that I like filling in gaps means that I'm always looking for gaps to fill in, so "generic" settings are no problem for me.                        </div>

                            Eric: I'm not Graham, but I direct your attention to the last part of his first post: he's not asking Americans to make settings that are less American - he's asking people to describe things better, and most of all, I think, push ourselves to decide what matters about a setting.<br/>
<br/>
You're right that you have to design for yourself first. But if we do the things that Graham is talking about, articulate what really matters about a setting, what is distinctive about it, how we see it in our minds eye, that setting will come alive not just for non-American readers but for American readers too. Often, this will make our American settings *more* American. (&amp; our British settings more British, our Canadian settings more Canadian (there's a thread for you - where are the Great Canadian RPGs?), our Middle Earthish settings more Middle Earthish...)                        </div>

                            More on this, in a separate post, so it's clear this is a reply to the whole discussion, and not just to Eric's good point above.<br/>
<br/>
I'm allergic to "generic America" ("Generica"?) too, but for perhaps the opposite reason than Graham.  Because while I'm not American, I think I do know the USA pretty well* (well enough to know how little I know anyway) &amp; I get irked by sketchy shorthand descriptions and gross generalizations. As Brand says, there really *isn't* a generic American high school or even generic highway.  (The "classic" John Hughes high school movies became classics, I submit, because, unlike many teen movies, the high schools he portrayed were in fact not at all generic. There is, weirdly, universality in specificity.) Unless your game is actually ABOUT generic-ness (this may have been the case with some of the "suburbs" Ronnies games), generic to me means "I haven't thought about the setting - I haven't questioned my assumptions - I don't really care about this part of the game."<br/>
<br/>
*Semi-pointless personal digression: After many years living in and travelling all over and studying the USA, I now teach American history and American studies to Canadian students. Canadians are often convinced they know everything there is to know about the US, but the US of their/our minds is all too often a vague homogenous illusion cobbled together from TV, movies, and a few trips to Detroit, not at all the vibrant, gorgeous, awful, richly-varied half-continent that I've gotten to know, love, and hate over the years. A big part of my job is to break up the monolith in my students' minds, to convince them of the mad diversity of American history, politics, and culture.                        </div>

A list of questions that the generic setting must address.  For example, "How safe is the high school?"<br/>2. A list of attributes that the generic setting has, with ideas about values for both extremes.  For example, "Some high schools have metal detectors because kids bring guns to school.  Some are safe and collegial environments."<br/>3. A series of media references.  "This high school is like the one in <i>The Breakfast Club</i>."<br/>4. A specifically chosen setting.

                            Graham, I suggest that when anybody puts "typical American whatever" they're thinking of the "whatevers" that they've seen in movies, not anything from their own, personal experience.  They're not talking about their high school, they're not talking about a local highway; they're talking about Breakfast Club and Easy Rider.<br/>
<br/>
Which is cheating, disingenuous, and artistically punking out, you're right.  As Rob points out, adorning your "generic" setting with actual details turns it into something worth reading and playing.                        </div>

                            I haven't checked out the games mentioned yet, but it seems to me that a generic American setting is much like how Burning Wheel does a generic fantasy setting.  The game doesn't provide the details because you provide the details yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
With an American town or high school, this is very easy -- particularly for Americans.  Just pick a place that you know, or one that you have material on, and set the game there.                        </div>

                            This is a good discussion, but I'm highly surprised that nobody has mentioned where "generic America" is supposed to come from - it comes from American TV and movies and comic books that don't take place in a particularly defined location, or which take place in a fictionalized location described vaguely in order to accomodate future development.  (Often, ironically, they are really in Vancouver.)  Whenever I see Generic Americanness, I figure "oh, like Sunnydale is sort of a Generic California Suburb/City" or "oh, like a soap opera that has an unnamed city in it" or "oh, like Keystone City in the Flash comics."<br/>
<br/>
Now there's certainly good things and bad things about that, but I can't see how anyone who has regular exposure to American media could be confused by it...                        </div>

                            You know, JD has a point. <br/><br/>It's also one of the reasons why (especially when combined with the reduce, reuse, recycle thread) that I've had such a fondness for doing things like taking Buffy and placing it in a very specific context: Vampire Slayers in Fremont High School in the 40s or late 60s and seeing what being in that kind of SoCal highschool, rather than the pretty kind, does to the game and people's responses to the material. <br/><br/>But that's at least partly because I think that much of modern American media punks out and uses all sorts of softening and generizing tricks as part of the....<br/><br/>You know what, never mind.

                            JD, I can tell you <em>exactly</em> where Sunnydale would be on a map of California (it's right above Agoura Hills).  There's nothing generic about it.  But that's because I live here.  I'm pretty sure somebody from the general region where Smallville is supposed to be could point us where it goes, too.  So too Gotham and Metropolis are pretty specific despite their ostensible genericness.<br/><br/>Now, whether providing only some details might be a useful tactic in an RPG product, to allow players to sympathize and customize however they like -- meh.  I suppose you could, but really, that's just punking out with a thin veneer of fakey customer service layered on top.  Gamers being gamers, they're perfectly capable of ripping your setting apart and transplanting the bits and pieces however the like, anyway.  Giving them less to start off with is not doing them any favors.                        </div>

                            Graham can kick me if I'm wrong to say this, but I think the discussion has missed the point slightly.  I think he was asking that if you're going to use a setting that would seem to be known by your readers maybe you should take that assumption and stick it.  Provide the players with enough info to know exactly what you mean.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some examples of generic settings that an American might not know:<br/>
<br/>
This game is set in....<br/>
<br/>
a typical school in Afghanistan.<br/>
a typical terrorist camp.<br/>
a typical Native American reservation.<br/>
a typical border town.<br/>
a typical Mexican fishing village.                        </div>

                            Fantastic. Useful stuff.<br/><br/>You've made me realise that my first post was confused. With retrospect, I realise I was blending two arguments together. <br/><br/>The first argument was something like:<br/><br/><i>1. If you use a American setting without describing it, I won't understand it and probably won't buy the game</i><br/><br/>...which is fair enough, I think, but not a very deep point.<br/><br/>The second argument is, I think, more interesting:<br/><br/><i>2. Generic settings are generally bad for a game</i><br/><br/>By a generic setting, I mean (as JD suggests) a bland, homogenised, media-generated stereotype setting. They're mostly American settings like suburbs, high schools and cities, but you might even include generic warzones and generic English country houses. <br/><br/>What I'm <i>not</i> talking about are open settings: settings which leave gaps to fill in. So, for example, I'd say that My Life With Master has an open setting (there's gaps to fill in) but not a generic one (it's not set in a bland, generic medieval Europe).<br/><br/>In fact, I think that (contrary to my first post) a generic setting can be detailed or undetailed. You can have an undetailed generic setting ("A typical American high school") or you can have a detailed generic setting ("A high school. The kids run up and down the corridors. There's a guy in glasses getting beaten up and some cheerleaders that everyone wants to talk to"). They're both rather bland.<br/><br/>The reason I brought this up was because, reading through various Game Chef and Ronnies entries, I kept seeing these generic settings. <br/><br/>So my argument is this: generic settings get used a lot, especially by new game designers (of whom I'm one). They're generally a bad thing: they make for games with little staying power, which you'd play once, but not again. I think that, if we want to encourage games which go on to be published, we should dissuade people from generic settings.<br/><br/>(Joshua and Rob said pretty much the same thing but better and shorter.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>Graham,</p>
<p>I'm not seeing a substantial difference between what you call 'generic' setting and settings 'with gaps'; isn't one just a sort of infelicitous way of naming the other? In actual play, we are going to fill in the gaps whether asked to or no; they are <em>there</em> regardless of how the designer describes them.</p>
<p>In other words, "setting with gaps" is a slightly more play-conscious description, in my mind, but that is all. I find it hard to fault a designer for saying <em>a</em> high school rather than <em>any</em> high school. I remain,</p>

                            Shreyas, it's a difference in presentation that can and will make a difference in play.  I can write up an offhanded description of a generic high school that's bland and boring, or I can write up a description of a generic high school that prods the reader's imagination to fill in details.  I can do this the crude way by having the playgroup answer a set of questions about the setting they're about to play in, or I can be sneaky and write up pieces that present intentional ambiguity.  Either way, it's different than saying "It's in a generic high school.  Moving on, now."                        </div>

<p>I am putting words in JBR's mouth, for which I owe him an apology, but I suggest that the yearbook is an example of a high school presented in a generic-bland fashion; despite the wealth of finely-grained information there, it's not information with structure or texture, just a scattering of crap (if you will excuse my term) that you have to assemble laboriously into anything useful.</p>

                            I can't speak for anyone else, but to me the difference between setting-with-gaps and generic-bland is the difference between the designer saying "the other stuff just doesn't matter" and "I don't care." It's a subtle difference, but it's real. I know it sounds like a near tautology: if it's good, it's "setting with gaps," if it's bad, it's "generic." But I submit there is a difference, and it has to do with the designer knowing and articulating what they care about and infecting you (or not) with their enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
Graham cites Dogs in the Vineyard as a game that, for him, does an American setting really well. Which it does. But there are HUGE gaps in the Dogs setting. Graham says he knows "what the air tastes like" in Dogs country. I haven't checked, but I'm sure there's nothing about what the air tastes like in the Dogs rules.  Vincent is very explicit about describing a few things, the things that excite him about the setting, in great detail, and then leaving everything else blank. But if he connects with those few details, if it sparks in your imagination, then you can fill all the blanks in yourself. Like I said before, there is universality in specificity. And of course you'll use the Western movies you've seen and the books you've read to do it. But it all coheres around that initial spark. Vincent doesn't say "it's your standard generic Western."                        </div>

                            Graham,<br/><br/>It's funny, I'm surprised to see someone say that C&amp;P has a generic setting. That's not how I would describe it. To me it's not so much that it has a generic setting as it has no setting at all. I wanted people to use the game to create the kind of procedural that they knew or liked best. In my head, and in a game I'd play, C&amp;P would be based in New York, because my history of procedurals (Law &amp; Order, SVU, Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, Without a Trace) all are based there. However, I wanted fans of CSI (Miami or Las Vegas), Crossing Jordan (Boston),  DaVinci's Inquest (Vancouver) , Blue Murder (Toronto), A Touch of Frost (Denton) or Prime Suspect (London?) etc. etc. to be able to use the world they were accustomed to placing procedurals in, or the world they belonged to to set the story. <br/><br/>I also shied away from setting it anywhere - generic or specific, because to do so, I would have to associate it with a particular time. In games I would play, they would most likely be modern day, but there's nothing to stop players from using C&amp;P in the 1950's of Dragnet or in the Minority Report of the future. <br/><br/>I thought that to pin it down to any setting would limit it's potential, because the focus of the game is a mechanism to create a specific pattern of a story, not to create a story specific to a place. Would it have been better if I did something like Jess did in Decade and provide several alternatives (1 page "tactile sheets" that provide several settings for the story over different places and times)?<br/><br/>If so, could you give me an idea of what a procedural would be like on your side of the pond?                        </div>

                            Thor,<br/><br/>I was careful not to make any of the mechanics, game flow or game process text (read: rules, not examples) setting dependant. So I protected the ability to customize without giving tools to customize.<br/><br/>I thought most of the folks drawn to C&amp;P would be folks who have a penchant for procedural media (TV or lit) and because of that, I thought it would make for an easy transition. In the playtests we did, though I think we all vaguely assumed New York as a backdrop, the setting was largely immaterial (which is not to say that it must or should be, just that's how it worked).<br/><br/>Now that said, since I entered the game and have received reviews, I'm finding that there's a wider market for the game that I originally had anticipated. The comment/remarks that I have heard over and over and was most surprised ato see were "I don't like/know police procedurals much, but I would/ really want to/will play this game."<br/><br/>I don't think I like the idea of putting setting creation rules in to the game flow itself, as I don't want to overemphasize the focus of the setting in the game or complicate the startup process for the game. However, I could well provide a set of tools to help with setting creation for those who are unfamiliar with the genre, like more emphasis on their setting, or who want to be adventurous with the setting. <br/><br/>What do you think?                        </div>

                            Hi Mo,<br/>
<br/>
This is difficult. I'm finding it hard to formulate a response I'm happy with. But here's an attempt...<br/>
<br/>
The impression I get, when reading C&amp;P, is that it's set in generic TV drama territory. Now, at first sight, that's fine. It's a roleplaying game about creating a TV drama, so <i>of course</i> it's set in TV drama territory.<br/>
<br/>
But my worry is that it's set in <i>generic</i> TV territory. Reading the examples and the sample characters, I get the impression that the setting is sort of an amalgam of police dramas.<br/>
<br/>
And I worry that, if we sat down to play this game, we'd set it, by default, in a generic police drama setting. We'd choose our agency - say, the FBI - and then start playing in a sort of generic American city. And I worry that, as we played our characters, we'd play them as TV drama stereotypes rather than genuinely interesting characters.<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, when I played this game, I'd like to create stories like those in Cracker or Life On Mars or the really knife-edge police dramas. To do that, I think we'd have to make an effort to push the game that way: "Listen, let's do a sort of dark psychological police drama. Let's use the stock character of Wilson, but let's make him psychotic. Fuck it, you know that bit where he's haunted by his victims? Let's make him actually see the ghosts."<br/>
<br/>
And I guess that, in a sense, I'd like the game to push us towards those stories every time. At the moment, I worry we'd end up mimicking the style of a police drama, rather than cutting loose and inventing our <i>own</i> police drama.<br/>
<br/>
How does that sound so far? Am I talking complete bollocks? I'm aware I can't quite put my finger on why I think the setting is generic rather than just open to interpretation.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and to answer your specific questions: yes, you're right, don't tie it down to one particular setting; yes, tools for setting creation might be really interesting; and so might a Jess-style list of different settings.<br/>
<br/>
Put it this way: I'd love to use this game to make stories like Cracker or Star Cops or Prime Suspect, but I didn't realise I could use the game that way. An example somewhere, in some form, to say "By the way, you can use the game in this way too" might really help me.<br/>
<br/>
And it's still <i>entirely</i> possible I'm talking complete bollocks. And I did I mention I really like the game? And I think I just derailed the thread. Oh well.<br/>

                            Graham,<br><br>Heh, well, it does look like the thread got derailed. Ah well, but I'm happy to keep talking C&amp;P. This is some interesting discussion, and it's very useful to me. I am seeing some glimpses into places I should expand the game, and understanding why it is that I don't want to/don't think I should expand others.<br><br>You said: <br><code>I worry that, as we played our characters, we'd play them as TV drama stereotypes rather than genuinely interesting characters.</code><br><br>and then this...<br><br><code>"Listen, let's do a sort of dark psychological police drama. Let's use the stock character of Wilson, but let's make him psychotic. Fuck it, you know that bit where he's haunted by his victims? Let's make him actually see the ghosts."<br>And I guess that, in a sense, I'd like the game to push us towards those stories every time. At the moment, I worry we'd end up mimicking the style of a police drama, rather than cutting loose and inventing our own police drama.</br></code><br><br>First, I think it would be wicked fun to play in your Wilson game. Neat concept. As a very side note, I'm curious: Were you envisioning something kind of real world and sureal like the interaction with dead people in Six Feet Under or something dark and tortured like Stir of Echoes? I see two different potentals there.<br><br>Second, I would be very happy if I could fine tune the rules enough and provide supplementary material to make either kind of those stories possible in C&amp;P... because it would make the game very versatile, however, I would decidedly NOT want to push toward those stories all the time. Let's see if I can explain why:<br><br>Police procedurals are really a third generation child of a fiction legacy, televised. The grandaddy of the procedural is the Detective of Great Skill: Holmes of course (or Poirot, or a dozen others, if you will), and others like him, who stood apart, magical and untouched, with a vast intelligence and keen insight, a mystical sense of perception. <br><br>Readers were to stand stand alongside Watson and marvel at, not identify with, his abilities. This eventually paved the way for the hardboiled hardhitting detective novels, who had vast, accentuated minds, took great risks, and although like Holmes, they stood outside of regular law enforcement and regular society as a Private Dick, instead, his world was dangerous and compelling, secretive and sexy, and in a complete rebellion to the mannered detectives that preceeded him. This was intended to show realism, but ended up hyperaccentuated.<br><br>So then down the road comes the procedural, that takes the inaccessibility out of the crime. The police are real people caught in real situations. They are hampered by bureaucracy, daunted by the criminals, they are both the defenders of  and the victim of the public, and yet still perservering. The allure of the procedural drama is placed firmly on the line between the complexities of the case and emotional resonance of the detectives. TRhe best procedurals pendulum back and forth above that line, which is why the political and emotional intensity meters are set the way they are. <br><br>Pushing it there every time would be counterintuitive to the draw of the genre... see?<br/><br/>This is an honest question for your consideration, not meant to be facetious: Is it maybe that you want to play the system but not to play the game?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>I wonder if looking at it on two axes may be helpful. I'm thinking about the level of detail provided by a written setting, and the degree of idiosyncracy it incorporates. This would lead to 4 poles:</p>
<ol>
<li>Detail Low, Idiosyncracy Low: Generic setting. Setting emerges from what the players bring to the table, but without guidance or a firm vision there may be a risk of tending to the lowest common denominator - safe options that are less likely to clash with the game, and that everyone has a good grasp on (because of their ubiquity in culture). However, a group confident with the game system and with their own vision are going to be able to wrap it around this fairly straightforwardly, as there is little 'getting in the way'.</li>
<li>Detail Low, Idiosyncracy High: I would put Dogs in this category: lots is left unsaid, but you have elements (coats, ceremony, mormonism) that are very evocative, and so interact with individual and group schemas to produce an emergent sense of setting, directed to some extent by those elements. But these elements suppress some possible settings just as they offer up others, and this may dismay some who find it difficult to play as these elements (more mormons than coats, from internet chatter) get in the way of where they want to go.</li>
<li>Detail High, Idiosyncracy Low: Concerned mainly with the mapping out of relationships between setting elements, in terms of distances, partnerships, and so on, to give some kind of predictable framework; the kind of work that John Kim has said he likes to be provided with by a game setting (hence I imagine one such setting might be Harn). </li>
<li>Detail High, Idiosyncracy High: Concerned mainly with throwing crazy ideas at the reader to get the juice flowing, as well as the mapping provided by the previous. Possibly something like Exalted? I dunno. Anything that provided me with the stuff that I got from reading China Mieville, say - a million tit-bits that left me wanting to know more.</li>
</ol>
<p>People will prefer some approaches over others for certain games. I would prefer a generic setting for a supers game because I have a palette of<br/>
super-stuff that I want to smear this way and that. A spacefaring game, I want some ideas, but once you get me started I'll be happy riffing off of them. The third option is less my taste, but would make sense where the characters were very compelling and I wanted a complex structure for them to explore and alter. The fourth I would probably read and then use the snippets that most jazzed me, zooming into the bits that I thought were cool. My current short-duration gaming taste shapes these preferences to a large extent. Possibly other people will have a single flavour that they always go for.</p>

                            Well, I thought I knew what the original complaint was - that generic settings like "unnamed American city" or "vague American town", as used on TV and in movies, annoy some, but now I'm not so sure.                        </div>

It didn't help that I changed my mind about the complaint halfway through the thread. It's all a bit derailed now (interesting though Alex's comments are). <br/>
<br/>
Just a suggestions, but shall we let it die now and split to other threads if we need to?<br/>

                            Sure....I think about these things a lot slower than most threads go, though, so I may necromance if I come up with something decent.                        </div>

                            JD, <br/><br/>I think all of us think about these things much slower than the threads go. Thus the reason we say some of the things we do.                        </div>
