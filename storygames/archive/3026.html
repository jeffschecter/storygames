I don't know how to put this... suggest themselves. That is, if you can build cues into the rules as to when they're supposed to come into play, linked to other rules, you tend to forget to use them less.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe example that I often give is with reward point pools. Where the rule is, "When you like something that somebody does, give them a point" or such. I find that often, even if this gets used occasionally, it also gets forgotten for long periods of time. Using tokens and such helps as reminders. But what works better, it seems to me, is to have one specific time during some process where the rule is, "And now, if this has happened, you can do X." The one event becomes a cue to use the other rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, for example with Jason's case, perhaps the process of setting up scenes can be more ritualized (I don't know how it works now), such that part of the process says something like "You then set the scene for the player on your left, unless somebody else spends a point to request that you make the scene for them instead." Vague example, I know, but hopefully you get the point. By having the rule as part of a continuous process - and not just dangling out there by itself - you make it more likely that it won't get forgotten in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is more, often in doing this, you discover a better way for the rule to work, hooking it in with other mechanics in a synthetic way that makes for additional effects that you hadn't planned on originally.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, FWIW, I call this idea Rule Cues. In Universalis, for instance, you can't just do a Complication whenever, there's a very specific condition that, when triggered, requires a Complication (when you try to cause a change in a component that I control with a component you control). This makes Complications flow naturally from the elements in play, a bonus effect to the fact that people tend to recognize better when a complication should happen. The trigger condition - trying to change a component you do not control - is the cue to use the rule.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not always easy to find a good cue. But try finding ones if you can, and you'll find that such rules tend to get forgotten a lot less.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71031">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AdamK" title="AdamK"><img alt="AdamK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AdamK">AdamK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71031/#Comment_71031" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T07:36:09+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  7:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice train of thought Mike, thanks for sharing!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71033">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71033/#Comment_71033" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T07:38:30+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  7:38AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike: It's like you're saying that the rules should be a web of contact points that, as the game flows through them cyclically make the next rule needed obvious and connected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71042/#Comment_71042" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T07:55:47+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  7:55AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's good advice, Mike.

I mean, this is the designer himself trying to playtest his own game. I think that "wrong" applies just fine in this case.<br/>\n<br/>\nMark: I don't know if it's an imperative sort of thing? What you describe is one potentially very effective way to deal with the rules, but not the only one. All I'm saying is that, if you put a rule out there all by itself, often it'll get forgotten in play. If you feel that the rule has good effects, then you might want to consider using a cue to make sure people use it.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr perhaps get rid of it. Or maybe it should be "optional" in effect. Consider the encumberance rules from D&amp;D; as the classic example. When a player says, "I grab that, and take it along" in theory that's a cue to do the proper math. But in practice, since the rule must be enforced without any mechanical prompt - and the fact that it's often irellevant - this rule gets set aside. Whether or not encumberance adds to your D&amp;D; game is going to be pretty local to groups (do they even have it in 3rd ed+?)<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's usually quite easy to remove rules from play, if you don't like them. It's much harder to get a rule into play if it's not been used. You tend to think, "well, it's been fun so far... why bother with another rule?" A rule pretty much has to "prove" it's worth.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those who find no rule able to prove it's value... there's freeform.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71231/#Comment_71231" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T20:29:41+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  8:29PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's my only gaming theory, whaddya want? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
