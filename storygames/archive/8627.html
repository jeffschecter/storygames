However, I basically thought of this as a way to make the opponents human (or humanoid at least, since most will probably end up as aliens) rather than more animal like aliens. <br/><br/>Actually, while I'm on the subject, do you think that the addition of humanoid enemies as the baseline would mess with any of 3:16's rules? I don't think so, but there could be something I'm missing (like players trying to loot weapons maybe?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191257/#Comment_191257" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-04T22:47:29+00:00" title="February  4, 2009 10:47PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My most recent session of 3:16 had humanoid cat-people with technology sufficient to fire upon orbital ships. I think if you simply make it clear that the looting of equipment is color, and only that allowed by the rules will have mechanical effect, it's all gravy. One thing I've done in the past.. If a person takes a weapon they don't normally have rights to, make it broken, and allow them to roll for it in their development roll. Another thing you could do, is have them roll NFA to try to fix it or figure it out (if it's alien tech) if they do, they can use it for that mission, but then they have to make a development roll to keep it after the mission is done. Or simply make their looted alien weapon mechanically identical to one of their current weapons.<br/>\n<br/>\nGM: This alien weapon fires spiky exploding balls at short range<br/>\nPlayer: Cool!

But I think that its possible that besides just being more obvious about "the point" (that you're the monsters) it could also open up a new can of worms- namedly, some of the people you're fighting <i>are</i> actually threats, and if you quit or go kill everyone you might actually be putting more people at risk than you're saving. (There's probably other issues there too). But yes, it is less subtle, and it's not for everyone, but its there in case anyone wants something new.\n<blockquote>definitely some interesting ideas there, though, and i love the way you described the setting.</blockquote>\nThanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
