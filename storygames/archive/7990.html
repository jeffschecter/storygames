I have two players Laura and Will.  Both of whom post occasionally around here.  A situation arose in play that really demonstrates the \u201cartistry\u201d factor of Sorcerer that I\u2019ve been struggling for years to articulate to people who ask about the game.<br/><br/>Laura\u2019s character is named Beatrice.  Her demon is her dead soldier brother Addison.  Addison is a Possessor who is housed in Beatrice\u2019s body.  I\u2019m using the material in Sorcerer\u2019s Soul that allows for a Possessor and Host to use Will rolls to assert control.  <br/><br/>During character creation the issue of whether there is any physical transformation when Addison is in control arose.  Laura made it clear that while she wanted to appear more \u201cmannish\u201d she did not want to actually transform into a man.  That means Shapeshift is out the window.  Instead we went with Cloak where what is being Cloaked is the fact that Beatrice/Addison is really a woman.<br/><br/>Will is playing Hollis, a Lieutenant in the confederate army.  His demon is the fire that burned Atlanta.  During character creation it came up that the fire was already a demon and that Hollis and few other men in a military coven simply wrestled it into submission and bound it.  That introduced the idea of the Union using Sorcery as a kind of military weapon.<br/><br/>During our first play session Hollis managed to capture a Union officer, Captain Adams.  Captain Adams is not himself a Sorcerer but is clearly involved in the Union\u2019s Sorcerous activities.  Will wanted to have Hollis interrogate Captain Adams and find out who the real Sorcerer in the Union army was.  He failed his Will roll and Captain Adams simply laughed and said he\u2019d rather die than give up the Union\u2019s greatest asset.  Beatrice is actually with Hollis at this point because Addison was part of the coven that bound the fire and indeed died in the process.  His instinct was to return to his former commanding officer.<br/><br/>At this point the issue of whether or not Addison\u2019s Cloak ability was mandatory came up.  It was pretty clear that Will and Laura were thinking about having Addison Hop (he has the ability) into Captain Adams and maybe go have him infiltrate the union army.  This is where the aesthetic issue came up.  Demon abilities by default can be turned on and off by their user.  So at this point some creative discussion was in order.<br/><br/>I really liked the idea that the ability was a \u201cmandatory\u201d effect of Addison taking control. I felt that was consistent with Laura\u2019s image when she first presented the idea.  So I put a couple of ideas on the table.  First I pointed out that if we wanted to just say Addison can drop the Cloak at will that would be fine.  I didn\u2019t really like that idea much, I got the impression that the players weren\u2019t crazy about it either.<br/><br/>Another idea I put on the table was that the characters could engage in some kind of transfer \u201critual\u201d that would aid in Addison\u2019s Hop that would narratively justify Addison\u2019s ability to drop the Cloak.  This wouldn\u2019t be any of the rituals in the book.  This isn\u2019t a \u201cnew\u201d ritual or anything like that.  This is purely a by-the-book use of Lore and the victories would roll over into Addison\u2019s attempt to use Hop.<br/><br/>I like this situation because it (a) demonstrates how sometimes aesthetic decisions enter into and limit play and (b) demonstrates the often asked question, \u201cJust what is Lore good for?\u201d  Ultimately the players didn\u2019t go with either of these and dropped the Cloak issue.  <br/><br/>However, thinking about it I realized this example also demonstrates why Sorcerer benefits heavily from multi-session play.  I found myself even in hypothetical considering what would it *mean* to un-\u201cmandate\u201d Addison\u2019s Cloak ability.  Having a few days to think about it I think I would have begun to weaken Addison\u2019s personality; playing him less as Addison returned from the grave and more like an abstract idealized concept of a solider or something like that.  It\u2019s irrelevant now since this didn\u2019t happen but it\u2019s more of that \u201caesthetic thinking\u201d I\u2019m talking about.  I wouldn\u2019t have come up with that in the moment.  It took a day or two to consider that away from the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176639/#Comment_176639" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T18:26:14+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  6:26PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, in case you\u2019re wondering what DID happen, they did try to transfer Addison into Adams but it failed which drove Addison into Need.  While Beatrice was out satisfying Addison\u2019s Need, Hollis simply decided to kill Adams, use a Contact ritual to communicate with his spirit and then rely on Sorcerer\u2019s ability to order any demon to do anything to simply re-demand that Adams tell him what wanted to know.<br/><br/>This, unfortunately, brought Hollis to zero Humanity.  For this game I\u2019ve decided not to rigidly define Humanity in advance nor its consequences for hitting zero.  I\u2019m quite let the content of play shape the definition and consequences as we go along.  To that end I let Will know in advance that going to zero humanity would be BAD but that I wouldn\u2019t use the default \u201cGame Over\u201d rule (I much prefer the ideas in Sorcerer\u2019s Soul).<br/><br/>So basically at the moment Hollis when to zero Humanity I unbound The Fire who immediately went haywire.  The last thing Hollis ordered The Fire to do was follow Beatrice/Addison.  At that moment they were squaring off with Addison\u2019s (still living) romantic rival, fellow soldier O\u2019Brian.  The Fire attacked O\u2019Brian and Beatrice failed to order it to stop.  After incinerating O\u2019Brian The Fire turns on Beatrice and burns her very badly as well.<br/><br/>Let me make this perfectly clear: Beatrice is right now carrying 10 *lasting* penalties over her base Stamina of 3.  That\u2019s well over double which is the \u201cdoes the character die?\u201d threshold.  So here\u2019s my opportunity to answer another oft asked question, \u201cHow do we know?\u201d<br/><br/>It\u2019s rather simple.  Beatrice\u2019s Kicker is that her Cousin Henry, who taught and helped her summon Addison has gone missing.  Does being incinerated by a crazy pillar of fire in anyway satisfactorily resolve that?  Even in some kind of weird art-house anti-climax way?  I hope it\u2019s fairly clear that the answer is objectively: No.  So, Yes, there will be medical aid on hand and no, her character doesn\u2019t die.  I know EXACTLY how I\u2019m going to open the next session of play.  She\u2019s in very, very bad shape.  But she isn\u2019t dead.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176646/#Comment_176646" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-28T21:20:05+00:00" title="October 28, 2008  9:20PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 28, 2008 9:22PM by John_Harper.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for sharing that, Jesse.

Whether or not we could use Addison for infiltrate was why being mandatory or not was important to the story.

It's why there are no Ability Limiters that reduce the cost of a demon's abilities or anything like that.

First it only limits the viewer in realizing that Beatrice is a woman (it doesn't grant her stealth or invisibility) and it's a mandatory manifestation of Addison being in control and he can't use it unless he's in control.
