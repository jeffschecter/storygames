I'm taking a razor blade to the thing though. I'm ditching ability scores altogether because I believe there are better ways to differentiate characters. I'm also ditching skills, feats, gold, and experience points. I'm adding stuff too, but I'm trying to add less than I take out. I'm borrowing a few things from old-school D&amp;D where it serves a purpose (I'm using morale rolls to patch up some problems with pacing in 4E) and a lot of inspiration from various story-games (especially 3:16.) I'm still shooting for some compatibility with 4E's (later) monsters and adventures though.<br/><br/>Combat hasn't been that hard to redesign. 4E's designers have been really transparent about the game's math, so I'm pretty much just taking the expected outputs as my starting point and looking for different inputs that get the same result without resorting to ability or feat bonuses. <br/>For example: non-striker characters in 4E are supposed to do an average of 9 points of damage at level 1. The weapon dice and ability bonuses in 4E are all designed to hit this target assuming a competently built character. You can get the same average by rolling 2d8 though. This has turned into a mechanic where you simply roll two weapon dice; one for each weapon you are holding (shields count as weapons, two-handed weapons add their weapon dice twice.) Damage scaling is handled by bumping up your main-hand and off-hand damage dice at odd-numbered levels and adding half your level to the roll as a bonus. Adding an exploding dice mechanic patches the problem of low damage variability at higher levels.<br/>As for attack rolls, you add the accuracy bonuses for each weapon you are wielding (if you are wielding a two-handed weapon add its accuracy bonus twice) instead of proficiency bonus plus ability bonus. Instead of half-level plus feat bonuses and magic item bonuses, you just add your full level to attack rolls like in 13th Age or Gamma World. Your class can add an extra expertise bonus as a patch.<br/>All in all, the combat math should come out where it's supposed to even though things don't quite work the same under the hood.<br/><br/>Whenever I find myself bumping into problems I just come back to my principles (trim down 4E, make tactical combat challenging, etc.) and my social contract (I live in South Korea so the people I game with and the people that playtest this will likely be my friends, fellow English teachers, and maybe a couple of Army guys; the game needs to be easy to pick up and prep for in order to accommodate everybody's busy schedules, and you need to be able to play it in a cafe or a bar since that's where we usually play.) If all else fails I take my problems to the internet like I'm doing right now.<br/>With that said, I'm pretty much done with combat, making progress on monster building, just about done with encounter building and character advancement and a bunch of little things like equipment tables and crafting and stuff.<br/><br/>I've gotten stuck where stuff outside of combat is concerned. 4E's non-combat mechanics are really anemic in that area anyway, and I've already gone and cut most of those out. I've tried to go back to my principles and my social contract for answers but I just haven't found much.<br/><br/>I do have a mechanic in place for bartering, crafting, and building things, but that's a thing that triggers at the beginning of game sessions. I have a mechanic that lets you burn off doom points for quicker advancement by meeting certain role-playing goals, but that's a thing that triggers at the end of game sessions.<br/><br/>I'm having trouble figuring out the dice mechanic for doing stuff (like becoming hidden, disarming traps, or moving over challenging terrain) throughout the game session. <br/>My principles and social contract demand a d20 based mechanic with bonuses for purposes of compatibility, but I've trimmed out all the feats and skill bonuses and ability bonuses that make the d20 mechanic sort-of work. And I'm not quite sure where to go from there. <br/>And I'm totally at a loss for skill challenges.<br/><br/>What I'm looking for here is advice for what to do when stuck on an important aspect of design, and maybe some suggestions for other games I should look at for inspiration (I have this goal of playing 100 rpgs and I'm only 36% of the way there so far. I was thinking of possibly borrowing mechanics from one of those, but I'm having a hard time figuring out which one does what I want.) <br/><br/>Thanks. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Any and all feedback is appreciated.<br/><br/>(Oh, and my publication goal, in case you were wondering, is to offer this game as a free pdf and maybe POD via Lulu or something. I'll be sure to link to the pdf here as soon as I at least have my second draft finished.) <br/><br/>*edit*<br/><br/>Sorry, let me be more specific as to why I am stuck.<br/><br/>I want my game to use d20 rolls to beat the same target numbers listed on the errata'd page 42 of the 4E DMG. The probabilities need to come out the same which most likely means using the same total modifiers as 4E but since I'm removing skills and ability scores I need to derive the values from somewhere else.<br/>Skill training gives you a +5 bonus, and your primary ability score gives you a +4 bonus. Then you have a half-level bonus. Your race grants you a +2 bonus.<br/>The racial bonus can stay. The half-level bonus needs to change to a full-level bonus for the sake of consistency.<br/>What am I going to replace those ability and skill bonuses with though?<br/>13th Age grants bonuses from backgrounds. Maybe I'll use those?<br/>Did I just solve the problem I was asking you guys for help with?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432990/#Comment_432990" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-25T06:15:08+00:00" title="May 25, 2014  6:15AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2014 6:18AM by AsIf.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are lots of ways to get stuck, and lots of ways to get unstuck.  You might get a lot of different kinds of advice on this question.  I'd say the most generally-applicable answer (besides "walk away from it and let it gel subconsciously") is to <b>keep changing your vantage point.</b>  Often.  Go from a top-down view to a bottom-up view.  Go from function to form.  Go from small picture to big picture.  Go from mechanics to feelings.  Repeatedly, back and forth, over and over.  Oscillate between modes.<br/><br/>For example.  You've spent a long time looking at the mechanics from a designer's standpoint: that's how it <i>works</i>.  Now flip around to the other side of the table and let your mind imagine how it <i>feels</i>.  Imagine a simple scenario.  Imagine <i>playing</i> it.  When you get to a part with no rules, don't start mechanizing.  Instead, just imagine what sort of <i>feel</i> you want play to have.  Crunchy and formulaic?  Charty and precise?  Fast and loose?  Skittery and satirical?  Random and nerve-wracking?  These are all different ways mechanics can <i>feel</i> - which is actually a separate issue from the mechanical operations themselves.  Once you know what you want it to <i>feel</i> like, you can flip back around to designer-space again and work on a mechanic for emulating that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus" title="Ursus_Spelaeus"><img alt="Ursus_Spelaeus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ursus_Spelaeus">Ursus_Spelaeus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432992/#Comment_432992" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-25T07:00:38+00:00" title="May 25, 2014  7:00AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That... actually helps a lot.<br/>Feel 1: Atavistic.

For example, he might play a new composition over the phone so it records on someone's answering machine. And then he might take the recording and speed it up or slow it down. When he eventually gets to hear that  recording, it sounds foreign and different: he can experience his composition as something unfamiliar, as an outsider, and then have a new reaction to it, different from however he's been looking at it "from the inside", so to speak.<br/><br/>You might also try presenting small parts of the game to others to see their reaction. (For example, "Here's the character sheet to a game you've never seen. What's your initial reaction?")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433007/#Comment_433007" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-25T21:27:30+00:00" title="May 25, 2014  9:27PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I can't go on, I abandon the project.

Pay attention to what the mechanics do, how players interpretate/reinterpretate them, how much time do they take and if that affects gameplay, how many people are distracted or engaged at any time and what atmosphere are you getting from it all. Improvise rules, rulings and mechanics if the game is stuck, write it down quickly and keep going until you get at least one of the game cycles/scene/whatever finished. It doesn't matter if it sucks, actually it's better if it does because you will realize what sucks and why.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
