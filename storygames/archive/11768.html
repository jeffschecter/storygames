Your feed starts at episode 74. How do I get the rest of the podcast?<br/><br/>sorry that this is all complaining. I love the early stuff, by the way. Orklord (Rich, right?) has a way of pulling great stuff out of the people he interviews.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262885/#Comment_262885" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T16:49:13+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  4:49PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 19, 2010 3:27AM by orklord.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hans,<br/><br/>First of all, thanks for the compliments on the show and my interviews.  It made my day!<br/><br/>As far as contacting us, you're right, we don't have an easy way to contact us about general stuff.  I'll work with our webmaster on putting some kind of Contact Us thingy.  Sorry about that and thanks for creating this forum post so we could answer you.<br/><br/>For episodes 40 - 73, they're on the site here:<br/><a href="http://www.canonpuncture.com/category/canon-puncture-show/" rel="nofollow">http://www.canonpuncture.com/category/canon-puncture-show/</a><br/><br/>You'll have to click on each entry to get to the MP3 itself, which as I poke around on the site... it's pretty clunky.<br/><br/>It will take a few days, but we will work on updating the Archives link so you can get everything from one easy link.<br/><br/>Again, thanks for the support and feedback.  I hope the current solution isn't a complete turnoff.  Once we have the archives page updated, I will let you know.<br/><br/>Rich<br/>Canon Puncture Show<br/>EDIT: Made the link clickable                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262888/#Comment_262888" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-18T17:01:58+00:00" title="March 18, 2010  5:01PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Rich!
