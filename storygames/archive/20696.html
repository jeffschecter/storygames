I'm going to brainstorm but I don't know anything about camping or scouting so feel free to suggest corrections:<br/><br/><b>Tents</b><br/>One tent fits two (according to PHB)<br/>Setting it up takes... 20 minutes? 5 minutes? Which?<br/>Tearing it down takes? 10 minutes?<br/>What's the point of a tent, to protect from precipitation?<br/>Does it do anything against cold?<br/>Does the tent make you extra vulnerable? How?<br/>Do you like freeze to death if you don't have a tent? Or what happens?<br/><br/><b>Bedrolls</b><br/>What even is a bedroll?<br/>And can you sleep without one, if so why do you need one?<br/>Like in our games people have just been plopping down to sleep in any place. In the dunes in the desert or in the stairs of Dracula's castle. Inside the castle in the stairs, how do you even sleep in stairs? I'm sick of this, I want to understand what's going on in the fiction!<br/><br/><b>Campfires</b><br/>How long does it take to set it up or put it out?<br/>It leaves tracks, right?<br/>(But so can just sleeping. But... remains of a campfire makes it easier to track you, I figure?)<br/>Does it attract monsters?<br/>Does it scare away monsters?<br/>As with tents and bedrolls, is there any "you don't die of cold" benefits?<br/><br/><b>Other similar things</b><br/>Any obvious oversights or are these three things enough if I already have a good system for food and water, and I deliberately want to exclude/handwave toilet stuff?<br/><br/><br/>Overall, as I said in the other thread, this is something that we can quickly zoom by "We set up camp as usual", "We set up camp as usual but no fire this night" etc once we've done it a couple of times and once we know the consequences of each item.<br/>And I'm not talking about "roll Survival to set up tent"... I'm thinking more... Blog of Holding suggested that not having a fire hid you from intelligent monsters and that having a fire scared away unintelligent monsters. Does that make sense? Simple rules-of-thumb like that is what I'm looking for. I'm looking for snowy blizzardy winters as well as leafy green grassy summers because I'm trying to set up a seasonal game.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454347/#Comment_454347" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-29T20:38:02+00:00" title="June 29, 2016  8:38PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just brainstorming here but maybe not having a bedroll adds two hours as you toss and turn trying to sleep?<br/>As a simple consistent rule idea                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454349/#Comment_454349" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-29T20:44:54+00:00" title="June 29, 2016  8:44PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So in our modified hexcrawl rules for Moldvay, not have the right gear incurs some extra HP damage from exposure.

Some basic observations:<br/><br/>The purpose of a <b>tent</b> is to trap warmth and keep away biting insects, rain and wind. Its utility for this variety of purposes depends mostly on the quality of the canvas. Routine use of tents in camping is a modern innovation, as dedicated canvas of appropriate quality would have been out of reach of most people in medieval times, and even where it was possible the weight of the tarp would have been an issue for people who had to carry their own gear, which would have been most people most of the time. Military organizations have been an exception for a long time, as they're hauling around a lot of gear anyway, and there is often more utility to the tent solution for an organized company than there is for a random wanderer.<br/><br/>In other words, a tent is often a luxury that has become a mainstay for us due to the availability of excellent canvas materials (really, a modern tent tarp is a lightweight wonder, not to speak of the tent struts). Having one in a pre-industrial setting implies a very sophisticated and purposeful cultural relationship to wilderness survival. It is practically the last thing you add to your survival gear, after everything else has already been taken care of.<br/><br/>I would suggest that having a tent should improve the quality of the rest (by whatever mechanics you find appropriate) in camping situations. It can replace a campfire for warmth as well, which is desirable. In "shelter mandatory" circumstances a tent is often a much easier type of shelter to procure than alternatives such as lean-tos or snow shelters or whatnot.<br/><br/>A <b>bedroll</b> or sleeping bag is basically a blanket sewn into a wraparound "bag" that you sleep in. (It's called "bedroll" in English because of the way it's tied into a roll for carrying, I imagine) It's better than a blanket because it's easier to get more airtight around a person, which reduces the airflow and thus makes it warmer. Like the tent, it is primarily a modern idea, and anachronistic in D&amp;D (as are many other things, of course). A bedroll is better than a blanket, but its existence implies somebody dedicated to sewing them, and as it's not a massive improvement, most places in most times in history have made do with simple blankets.<br/><br/>As for the necessity of a bedroll or blanket, they are often near mandatory for camping; lacking extra insulation during rest at night will at best make for fitful and uncomfortable sleeping, and at worst be cause for hypothermia. Depending on the climate, sleeping without blankets should reduce the quality of rest drastically, and possibly cause illness or injury.<br/><br/>The primary purpose of a <b>campfire</b> is to boil water and cook food. The secondary purpose is to provide additional warmth and light. The tertiary purpose is to keep wild animals away (realistically a moot point, but you'll see this thrown out there as a narrative). A campfire ranges from being a luxury to being mandatory depending on the type of maintenance your expedition needs: if your food has to be prepared, or you need the light at night for something, or your blankets are insufficient for the climate, you'll want to have the fire.<br/><br/>Note that building the fire takes time as you need to gather the firewood for it. In non-forested conditions this can be a major issue in itself, such as in a desert, where you'd likely carry the fuel with you from far away.<br/><br/><b>In summation:</b> blankets are the most basic and important part of this triad, and all campers should have something of the sort no matter what. Tents are second-most useful, but it's far from given that you have access to such. Campfire access is easy, but the benefits are situational, and in any case less than those from blankets and tents.<br/><br/>Note that the ideal camping arrangement depends on the nuances of the weather: how cold, windy and rainy it is when and where you camp. On a warm (like, &gt;10 Celsius), calm and dry night just blankets will suffice in most climates. Adding a camp fire makes it possible to camp out at freezing temperatures (0 C) provided the correct camping techniques are used. Below that a tent or other shelter is pretty mandatory. An insufficient camping solution for the weather will result in anything from exhaustion to hypothermia, depending on how much you fall short of the conditions.<br/><br/><b>Rules implications</b><br/><br/>As you might discern from the above short treatise, I tend to view the "camping conundrum" in terms of risk management, with the understanding that individual player characters have differing levels of wilderness survival skill. For this reason most of these choices about the appropriate equipment and its use in our campaign are made on "autopilot" - players make various skill checks for their characters, and the GM describes culturally appropriate things for the characters to do. Sometimes their knowledge and common sense fail, which causes risks, that may or may not actuate into a crisis situation.<br/><br/>Specifically, I tend to avoid simple rules like "if you sleep without blankets, lose 1 hitpoint per night" because of how much realistic uncertainty there is to something like that: the outcome depends on how cold the night is, what the sleeping surface is like (convection heat loss is a major part of the equation in camping), how inured the character is to sleeping like that, and a host of other nitpicky details. It's more realistic and interesting to make the occasional dice roll about the matter to see when the circumstances should happen to conspire in a way that truly becomes a serious survival problem. Sometimes bad choices won't matter because you were lucky, sometimes even good choices will only help you barely scrape by.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454372">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454372/#Comment_454372" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-30T11:05:54+00:00" title="June 30, 2016 11:05AM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, this is...

In the winter you need at minimum blankets, lean-tos and a fire - or alternatively heavy blankets and tents (or other enclosed shelter). In all cases you'll also need to use these correctly, and there may come about nights when your equipment falls short. For example, if all you have a single blanket, there's a big difference in whether you form a bed out of boughs under a tree, or plop down in a wet puddle in the middle of a field to sleep - the former case minimizes your heat loss during sleep, while the latter maximizes it. Similarly, while the blanket will suffice you most nights in the Finnish summer when appropriately used, it will fail you on a wet frosty night in the early summer.<br/><br/>(I'll note that when I say "need", I am being literal. What you "want" to have for camping in Finland in the summer in the modern day is a tent plus a bedroll - that's the normal loadout anybody would take today. I happen to have done camping with just the blanket solution myself, so I know it to be feasible, but generally you'll want to have the tent if you can.)<br/><br/>What happens when you don't have sufficient equipment for the conditions? In liminal cases you may be able to get a bit of sleep, but you wake up sorely stressed by the cold, as your muscles (the ones against the ground will likely be the coldest) cool down. This may then cause either stiffness in the limbs, involuntary shivering, or cold numbness and eventual frost-bite as the most serious outcome. The basic problem is that either your body presence is aware enough to try to keep you warm, in which case you'll maintain a level of activity that prevents sleep (resulting in exhaustion), or you're exhausted enough to sleep despite the lowering body temperature, which could end up with either frostbite (in winter) or lowering of the core body temperature and sheer death due to exhaustion. You're likely to catch a flu of some sort and succumb to that long before then, of course, as the immunological defenses suffer from the heat deficit.<br/><br/>Of course, as humans we can act consciously on this sort of thing, too. It is <i>entirely</i> realistic for a person to realize that their camping solution is being insufficient and that they <i>can't</i> go to sleep tonight without just making things worse for themselves. In those situations what you do is basically a sitting camp: rest as well as you can sitting or standing, leaning against something that doesn't transmit heat very much, exercise regularly through the night to keep warm in the extreme conditions (this is a scenario that would mostly come up in the winter), and in general focus on keeping your muscles warm and limber while also resting as much as you can. It's not actual sleeping, but it's better than nothing, and if it helps you get to a safer place the next day, then it's much better than a night of sleep after which you may not be able to walk at all. (Or won't wake up at all, I suppose, in the most extreme case.)<br/><br/>As you can see, it's not exactly trivial to systematize the effects of "sleeping on the cold ground" - it's a complex set of interactions that most of the time result in trivial consequences like feeling stiff in the morning. It's only when you combine exhaustion over many days of hard trekking, constant exposure to elements, low quality of sleep and other physical expenses that all this starts to matter much. I mean, I could probably go out tonight without even a blanket (I'd want something for the bugs, though) and sleep out for one night with nothing worse than bad rest and stiff muscles; this would not matter much in the big picture for me, but that's because I'm otherwise healthy and I've been resting well recently and I won't need to walk 20 kilometers and fight three skirmishes tomorrow, too.<br/><br/>It's possibly simplest to just shave off a single hitpoint for a night with marginal equipment, and rule rest impossible when the deficit is major (bringing whatever exhaustion rules you use into play, of course). That way it mostly won't matter, but if you're in bad shape otherwise, taking exhaustion damage from other stuff, or fighting battles, then that single HP might matter. Methodologically I feel that this depends heavily on the particulars of a campaign, where it is and what the group is doing; for example, my procedures for camping fantasy tend to ebb and tide depending on whether we're doing hardcore hexcrawling or just a quick jaunt to a dungeon <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454384/#Comment_454384" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-30T21:01:18+00:00" title="June 30, 2016  9:01PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2016 10:06PM by 2097.">edited June 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just as an aside, 5e's exhaustion rules have been posted before but there are six levels, the first level is disadvantage on checks, the sixth levels is death, bypassing all saves.

Even on an otherwise pleasant summer night, you definitely need a blanket to prevent wind chill with any moderate breeze (very roughly, something like 20km/hr or faster). A wind break--natural or constructed--is crucial at higher speeds. <br/><br/>A fire for boiling water is usually very important. One commonly needs to refill water stores, and realistically, boiling prevents at least some water spoilage (from certain bacteria, at minimum) that can prevent seriously incapacitating illness. (Hence those "purify food/water" spells--the fantasy equivalent of iodine tablets or UV light.)<br/><br/>I have a ton of camping/wilderness experience, so feel free to ask about specific cases!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454502/#Comment_454502" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T11:03:15+00:00" title="July  2, 2016 11:03AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2016 11:08AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It's possibly simplest to just shave off a single hitpoint for a night with marginal equipment, and rule rest impossible when the deficit is major (bringing whatever exhaustion rules you use into play, of course).

Everyone has their camping gear and there's no reason to be unusually cautious? Fine, no reason for us to discuss it any further: no penalties, no bonuses, no arguing over who lights the campfire and who sets up the tents and who does the cooking. If there's an encounter table, the rolls we make on it will be the default ones. If there are some character-specific requirements ("8 hours of uninterrupted rest" or whatever), we'll assume they can be satisfied under those circumstances, no debate required.<br/><br/>We'll talk when you're escaping from the evil sorceror's castle without your stuff, or when you're trying to sneak through bandit country, or when you decide to go ahead with your plan to take the mountain passes even though everyone told you it was going to be an early winter this year. Those might actually be situations where how you sleep and stay warm and get fed aren't boring questions. (They will also be, by definition, unusual situations: if it keeps happening over and over and over to the point where we're spending more time playing Man vs. Wild than anything else, then we'll really need to figure out why we got our own game so very wrong.) But even then, I don't know that it's going to be worth our time to do more than abstract the effects into very simple, mild-to-moderate penalties of some kind, or maybe handwave some other rule into the mix ("make a Fortitude save versus this DC to avoid penalties for your awful night out in the woods").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454506/#Comment_454506" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T14:55:36+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  2:55PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2016 3:00PM by 2097.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's precisely for those "we lost our gear" situations that I want to be prepared.<br/><br/>Ideally, if they have everything, we can just go through it "Have your tent?

Close to freezing at most, but normally not below that. Just as Stephen says, that's cold enough to require a bedroll, but not, you know, freezing cold. As winds are not usually very strong, and there obviously isn't moisture in the air to soak up heat, outright freezing is unlikely through a single night. Perhaps if an evil vizier's spell trapped the adventurers in the desert night for 2d6 days straight it might be different - the desert could conceivably become quite chill indeed over a hundred hours of darkness <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/>The concept of desert (wasteland devoid of plant life due to lack of moisture) stretches seamlessly towards the tundra of course, so you could have a desert that goes sub-zero regularly, day and night. It's really the lack of water in the local biosphere that makes a desert environment different; I understand that the reason for the unusually quick reversals in temperature between night and day are largely because the desert environment does not have moisture in the ground and air to soak up heat and thus moderate the temperature. In a more normal environment the heat evaporates water and cold condenses water, which is all energy that doesn't go into heating or freezing the ground and the people.<br/><br/>Speaking generally of D&amp;D practice, I tend to view the wilderness survival lore in a similar way as I view the military know-how, pre-industrial handicrafts, folklore and small group commando tactics featured in the game: it's all beautiful knowledge about the world applied to gaming. Learning about the practicalities of adventuring and putting that knowledge to use in the game is, for me, a similar essential pastime as painting miniatures is for some gamers. Thus it's no surprise that I recommend learning more and satisfying your thirst for well-regulated gaming procedures by finding stuff out and applying it. The more we learn, the more entertaining and intricate the game becomes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454514/#Comment_454514" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-02T17:16:26+00:00" title="July  2, 2016  5:16PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Calling it desert is perhaps exaggerating it, it was a couple of days marches away from Mahabba, a League city in Zakhara in al-Qadim!<br/>But, I've already been immensely helped by this thread so far so I'm very happy I asked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454534">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454534/#Comment_454534" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T00:42:33+00:00" title="July  3, 2016 12:42AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Ideally, if they have everything, we can just go through it "Have your tent?

Anything is possible, it's like a small-scale MMORPG without the constraints of a computer program. <br/><br/>It's a fascinating idea, but I've since noticed that it doesn't hold true, at least not for me even though I encounter people who clearly enjoy RPGs and view them as a sort of virtual reality. RPGs sing to me when we're playing the conflicts in one way or another, be it mutually exclusive character goals or problem solving in a dungeon. <br/><br/>That implies to me, very clearly, that RPGs are first and foremost games and the more you add secondary aspects like living the life of your character the less fun per hour you get (this can't be the core fun in playing dollhouse style Ars Magica, right? It's more about expressing your unique character in conflict situations?). And I mean secondary to the conflicts. Camping equipment can definitely be important in the conflicts of a logistics heavy game.<br/><br/>What do you care more about than living in the game world? Do you care more about the challenge aspects, or finding out how the core conflicts in the situations at play work out? If not, what makes the game sing for you?<br/><br/>Are you asking about the pros and cons of camping equipment precisely to include more depth to the virtual reality in a meaningful way, gameplay and challenge-wise?<br/><br/>If you've got techniques or mindsets to make virtual reality fun without it being secondary to the game I'd be interested to hear about them.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454550/#Comment_454550" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-03T15:06:41+00:00" title="July  3, 2016  3:06PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think part of it is the challenge and part of it is the dollhouse.<br/>Need to test more <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454604/#Comment_454604" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-04T20:28:22+00:00" title="July  4, 2016  8:28PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What a great thread!

This way the meat of the game is still in the conflicts, partly even in the camping interlude. When the camping situation is described in detail the possible combat encounter would have a lot more depth I think. <br/><br/>The trick might be to have this interlude 1) pace the overall gameplay, sometimes a break in tension does wonders before delving into the next horrible pit of death, and 2) keep it short enough that it doesn't get boring.

They are in fact very similar to my own. The way I phrase this issue in D&amp;D is that I want the game to develop situations "organically", which means a kind of automatic writing: we talk about blankets and campfires <i>non-intentionally</i>, merely because they are something that occurs in the fictional situation, not because any player particularly has a ploy in mind for them. Then later on, it just so happens, with no planning on anybody's part, that the blankets and campfires and whatnot come to matter for play. It is a very powerful thing for something like this to pre-exist as an organically established fact, as opposed to having e.g. the GM invent the details to match the challenge.<br/><br/>(Note that this technique is in no way limited to campfires. It is a core technique or instinct for this kind of game that whenever something new and fictionally intricate occurs, should there be any interest, the players will focus on talking it out in detail. When the party haggles with a merchant for the first time, we want to see what "haggling" in this sense even means and what it may accomplish; when the party looks for secret doors, we want to see what that can even conceivably mean; when the party decides to "make torches" out of scratch, we want to talk out what goes into making one. This same process of delving into the fictional detail to ground future decision-making is all around us in D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>What this creative process looks like in practice is exactly as Sandra describes in her case: we want occasional, fleeting discussion of fiction-qua-fiction, without being stuck in the eternal moment, all embedded in the wider concerns of game-mechanical backbone and strategic goals of the adventurers. The clarity in itself is satisfying, because it affords us greater confidence in case the discussed issue proves tactically crucial later on. There is no contradiction in wanting to talk about the specifics of what "making camp" looks like, and there is no contradiction in wanting to only do this occasionally, when the mood strikes. The purpose of this kind of play content is very clear, and if anyone can suggest a better way to establish a naturally emergent tactical landscape, I'm sure that I wouldn't be the only one interested in that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_454646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454646/#Comment_454646" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-05T16:42:24+00:00" title="July  5, 2016  4:42PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes!<br/><br/>Here's the key:<br/><br/>The "punctuated by monster checks" bits (a metaphor for various kinds of danger and risk-assessment in D&amp;D) make the detailed bits of narration matter.

Because if it's the former, then really, knowing that <i>tonight</i> it matters how you set up camp not only doesn't ruin anything, it may actually make the challenge of setting up camp properly more exciting.<br/><br/>And if it's the latter -- if the fun is supposed to be that you'll be performing a certain number of unnecessary (or even pointless) tasks in order to be pleasantly surprised the one time that the task is actually significant -- then you might still wonder whether that's a good use of your time in that particular game. (I could see the answer to that being 'yes' for a group that does 8-hr sessions and doesn't mind being a little bored during them on a regular basis, and 'no' for a group that plays a 3-hr session

constant time pressure, or making sure that various decisions all have opportunity costs.<br/><br/>However, if you want "the players were smart enough to remember to do this thing at a time when it mattered" to be a possible source of challenge in the game at all, you're going to come face to face with this as you're playing, sooner or later.<br/><br/>For this reason, a lot of game groups have a de facto principle or rule, along the lines of:<br/><br/>* Any time something is uncertain or wasn't established previously, we assume in the PC's favour. (e.g. "I need a healing potion. Did we bring any, or did we leave them at the camp?"

I liked this thread so much I thought I would come out of hiding. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I love the idea of finding beauty in the mundane; of briefly enjoying the logistical challenges of setting camp, or ordering a round of drinks, or entertaining peasants with your skills for small change. <br/><br/>It's important these moments are touched upon if you're interested in varied depictions of character or mood, and the opportunity to "find the adventure" in the mundane. <br/><br/>When I say "find the adventure" I mean giving the opportunity for conflicts and drama to develop from innocent intentions. Perhaps the bard accidentally insults the whole village with a particular song as his player fumbles that entertain roll, or maybe a crit on collecting firewood uncovers a magic fountain. <br/><br/>With this in mind, the world can be presented as a breathing, changeable place worthy of our continued adventure as players. <br/><br/>But sometimes just playing through the argument about who's going scavenging tonight can be fun. I've had engaging intraplayer rivalries over who's best at the most mundane activities; the title of <i>Provider of Provisions</i> was a hard-won thing. <br/><br/><br/>The question is how and when do we agree to engage in these moments without bogging down the pace of play?<br/><br/>I find appealing the idea of some kind of physical sideboard on the table when thinking about camp: a place where we arrange our minis/tokens into a drawn map of our typical sleeping arrangements with habitual instincts/activities scribbled down. Every time the fiction necessitates we camp we can just point to the sideboard and say "yep," and every time something deviates from the norm we can quickly establish how the usual routine has been disrupted: the monster attacks the easternmost tent? We know instantly that's PC1 and PC2 who are in trouble. <br/><br/>My philosophy is that RPGs are incredibly tactile: the more objects, diagrams and totems I can incorporate into play, the happier I am.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474533/#Comment_474533" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-07T16:11:46+00:00" title="June  7, 2018  4:11PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Hi Potemkin!

I was asking "you're not sleeping in armor, right?" because my normal group never does. And he was like "What!!!! Of course I do!!!" almost OOC-upset. And I was like "Ok, ok, that's fine, that's fine!" He didn't have any exhaustion levels and he had all his HD so there was no real consequence.<br/><br/>I like there being an "uncomfortable sleep" rule now. I only wish it was a little harsher because it's so often zero consequence to sleep in armor. <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23cruella&amp;Mode=like">#cruella</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474590/#Comment_474590" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-08T19:56:36+00:00" title="June  8, 2018  7:56PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess the simplest "sleeping in armor" rule you could make is also the most realistic: armor is uncomfortable, thus you can't sleep in it.
