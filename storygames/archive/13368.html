We've done this in Finland through <a href="http://www.arkkikivi.net/kauppa/#kaikki" rel="nofollow">a small webstore</a>, and this practice paid off nicely at Spiel last month as well, when the retail section did a great deal to off-set the expenses of the fair for us. I'm in fact considering writing up a new English-language webstore to see if Europeans in general would find the service useful. It's not fancy and I actually work too much in reviewing the games and personalizing the sales experience, but it's fun and educational, and keeps me abreast of the hobby.<br/><br/>I usually get new stock for the store in big collated orders to save on postages. Due to the low demand for this sort of specialty gaming stuff the half a dozen copies I usually get of individual products last us 1-2 years at a time, so refilling the shelves roughly once a year makes sense. The last couple of years I've visited Gencon in person and taken stuff back with me from there, thus obviating the need for a postal arrangement; this year, though, I skipped on Gencon, and thus find myself in need of a big postal collection once more. I'm in fact exploring the possibility of making it a big pallet shipment; as most of my own stock of eg. Zombie Cinema is in the USA as well, combining the various sorts of shipment starts to make for such a large package that parcel mail is clearly less affordable than just arranging for a whole pallet.<br/><br/>But that's just background, my actual topic here is that I'll need to collect some background information for making my purchases. The Arkenstone store paradigm is a specialty boutique model, meaning that we buy and sell games from the margins of the commercial scene, titles that do not make much of an appearance in the real (that is, really revenue-making) game stores. Our buying criteria is basically that if Eero likes it and it does not have mainstream availability, then it's in, or if it's particularly culturally significant then it might get in anyway. Commercial success is not a significant issue, I'm cool with sitting on three copies of a marginally known game for years on end, waiting for the one person who wants exactly this product. As can be seen in the product <a href="http://www.arkkikivi.net/kauppa/#kaikki" rel="nofollow">master list</a> and the <a href="http://www.arkkikivi.net/kauppa/loppuneet" rel="nofollow">sold out products list</a>, historically our interests and attention have largely focused on "Forge-style" games, of course with some exceptions. I'm also proud of the <a href="http://www.arkkikivi.net/kauppa/tuote?t=OSR" rel="nofollow">OSR selection</a> Jim Raggi helped me garner this last fall. I'm harping on the selection criteria to emphasize that we are not, in fact, strictly ideologically limited to indie games; if a game is small-press and should get some more representation and coverage due to its substantial merits, then I'm usually happy to add it to the store. We even have a couple of boardgames as opposed to rpgs; anything flies as long as it's good and not adequately serviced by mainstream distribution.<br/><br/>Thus, my question is simple: what new games have come out especially over the last year that I should consider for the store? I'm not exactly unknowledgeable about the scene, but it does change quickly, and I haven't been very careful about keeping up with the latest developments due to other responsibilities. For example, people kept asking me about Fiasco at the Spiel, and I'd just about only heard the name before the convention, and I certainly was not aware that it was already published. I've only had the chance to read Apocalypse World because my brother is a huge fan and bought it personally. And aside from those two games I can't even name any new games that came out at Gencon this year, that's how out of the loop I am.<br/><br/>Obviously games that are already on my lists above are less useful, but other than that I'm interested in anything you guys might consider useful for us to stock. Age of the game is no issue - I just bought eight copies of the Hero Wars Deluxe edition at a rather fair price at Spiel from the local Glorantha association, who apparently had lost their faith in ever getting rid of the stuff. I'm probably not going to get copies of the various OSR retroclones just because they're so ultimately redundant towards each other and LotFP which I already have... that's pretty much all the thinking I've done on this so far.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301191/#Comment_301191" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T22:19:23+00:00" title="November 17, 2010 10:19PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 18, 2010 5:48PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To start off my shopping list, here are the titles that I intend to research further and ask about that we haven't already had in our store.

Those are usually relatively good about recognizing the recent Forgista developments.<br/><br/>Also, FATE: I'm currently a bit torn on whether to get FATE stuff, so if anybody has any interesting points, I'm open for debate. On the one hand they're well-made and popular games that would no doubt sell better than most, but on the other they're already rather nicely available from other places. Perhaps the most damning detail from my viewpoint is that the FATE games are by nature somewhat clonish towards each other, so each new title has little of the novelty value that our customers like; once you've seen one, you've almost seen them all, insofar as game design goes. I'm also hesitant because it's expensive to get an exhaustive selection of FATE games - they come out so often and in such great numbers that it just doesn't make sense for me to get completionist about having each separate title available. I'm considering just getting some more copies of SotC and leaving it at that, just so I'd have one title for the customer who wants to see what this FATE thing is all about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301195/#Comment_301195" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T22:34:25+00:00" title="November 17, 2010 10:34PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Smallville isn't indie but it is very story-gamish and scratches that itch for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301198/#Comment_301198" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-17T22:45:20+00:00" title="November 17, 2010 10:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not a bad suggestion, Danny.

It is indeed something I would care much about. Currently I'm always buying from Leisure Games (shipping prices from IPR are ridiculous here in Italy, plus there are timing issues, both with them and the un-store, so I abandoned both). However, suppose I'm curious about a new title that feels catchy, knowing that the store cares about quality and that I can buy them with little knowledge of the game is reassuring. Leisure Games is very good (i'm extremely satisfied about costs and shipping times). However the selection criteria of games is kinda dubious to me. For instance, Iron Gauntlets appears in the indie rpg list, and as far as I know it has nothing to do with the Forge. On the other hand, the Burning Wheel does not...<br/>I'd be curious to buy from you and see. Personally, one criteria for which I care very much is the conditions in which the package's content comes. I'm an obsessive-compulsive bibliophile. Even just slightly damaged books bother me, so I always ask for careful wrappings. Leisure Games does that well enough for my tastes...<br/><br/>Thus said, shouldn't you include Mars Colony? It's just plain brilliant. And is there any physical copy left around in the world of The Mountain Witch or Nine Worlds? <br/>And c'mon! You can't do without Hell For Leather (Sebastian Hickey's) and Hell 4 Leather (Joe Prince's)... can you? They're impossibly fun to play...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301207/#Comment_301207" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T02:08:15+00:00" title="November 18, 2010  2:08AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tazio - glad you like this, I'm pretty proud of this facet of the operation in terms of cultural momentum, we're providing a pretty impressive service here in Finland, I think. Thanks to our store Finns tend to get a larger selection of Forge stuff than anybody else around, although it often takes as long as a year for me to get around to arranging for a new order of old stuff and new hotness; our retail selection rivals IPR when we go to a convention, at least in width of selection if not in depth. We get some international orders from "insiders" who know to ask me about it personally, too - we don't have anything against international sales per se, I just haven't gotten around to creating an English-language webstore yet.<br/><br/>I know what you mean about book quality in mail ordering - we get some customers who are similarly bibliophilic about it. I personally am much more laid-back and functionally oriented about books, so while we don't go out of our way to rip the books apart, I don't worry about their condition excessively unless the customer does. Stuff often spends years on our shelves and in luggage in between conventions (Spiel saw our last copy of No Press Anthology leave the nest after five years, for example), so a modicum of wear comes naturally, especially to the sort of cheap digitally printed booklets, pamphlets and leaflets that indie games tend to come as. We mainly fight this deterioration by looking for individualized customer satisfaction: those who don't mind can take the copies of 1001 Nights that have white cracks on the backs (to pick an arbitrary example), while we'll try to find a better one for the customer who wants something else, and of course we'll take special care to create secure packages for the customers who're worried about the basic envelope thingies and other systems my brothers think up to mail games. Full return rights for postal customers of course, in case you're disappointed with the quality.<br/><br/>I also agree with you about retailer discretion, that's a big part of my personal satisfaction in this; I like to think that I know everything we sell and only stock the best and a generally exclusive selection, at least according to my own tastes. Not that I don't get the occasional less stellar game into our inventory (difficult not to - I buy essentially blind often enough when going after a new designer), but the discretion improves constantly as I leave less interesting stuff out of the line-up and reorder the ones I find interesting. In fact, one of the reasons for why I haven't started an English version of the webstore yet is that I'm still thinking of the exact representation - the Finnish store started with about a dozen games, but now it's grown to something like 150, so I really should create some further categorization and characterization tools to get rid of the massive master list. Everybody tells me that I should categorize games according to literary genre (fantasy, horror, etc.), but that never did that much for me. Food for thought, there should be some way to emphasize the culturally important and interesting games without unduely hiding and lessening the exposure of the interesting marginal stuff.<br/><br/>(Strange side-topic, this; interesting anyways, more people should start their own garage indie retail operations to fulfill local needs.)<br/><br/>Anyway, yes - those are good suggestions, I'd forgotten about the existence of Mars Colony - is it already out for real? The ashcan version seemed interesting two Gencons back. Mountain Witch and Nine Worlds are completely unavailable at the moment as far as I know (except for the Finnish-language version of TMW, of course; still have several dozen of those).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301209/#Comment_301209" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T02:43:50+00:00" title="November 18, 2010  2:43AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kagematsu sells wonderfully at conventions.

Yes, as far as I know Mars Colony is a definitive edition now, and is available in the indie un-store and Leisure Games.

It focuses on enabling games similar to Alien, Dead Space, Pandorum or Event Horizon.  The mechanics and the damage system are heavily based on the movie logic inherent in the genre.  Over time, the generic capabilities ablate away, leaving only the deeply personal traits for your actions.   It's certainly a modern design to my eyes, and one particularly well suited to one-shot games or shorter limited campaigns.    The flavour alone is worth the cost I think.

Maschine Zeit seems quite cool, just the sort of no-name (in these circles, I mean) gamble that is fun to take and rewarding when you discover a hidden gem of a game.<br/><br/>I like Dresden Files novels (hadn't heard about it before the game came out, actually), but haven't checked out the game yet. I'm demotivated by their high availability through other channels, the customer doesn't really need me to bother with it. I suppose those books wouldn't be with me forever, but I always feel a bit foolish when people come to me to buy games that they would probably get at about the same price from their local brick-and-mortar retailer. Then again, you guys are probably right that if I'm going to make FATE available to customers, then Dresden Files seems to be the current flagship product.<br/><br/>Really, FATE should have some cheap ($20 or below) basic product that'd focus more on game design and theory and less on presentation. That sort of thing would sell much easier to the designers, theorists, neophiles and other weirdos who buy from us.<br/><br/>Maid is a very solid game and an exciting cultural project; I managed to get some copies at 2009 Gencon before they ran out at IPR, but those sold out pretty quickly - definitely going to contact the guys for a second shot.<br/><br/>I know that Panty Explosion is a solid game (followed the production), but I haven't tried to get it for retail for some reason - probably because I've had so many less exposed games to buy through the last few years; Panty Explosion and Classroom Deathmatch have taken on pretty well in normal game stores, is my impression. I guess these go to the same pile with Burning Wheel and FATE - good bulk for the collection, but not culturally mandatory due to their being available otherwise as well.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Saint&amp;Sinner</cite><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>Smallville isn't indie but it is very story-gamish and scratches that itch for me.</blockquote>\nAnd apparently not easy to get Europe judging from the people complaining about it. I think their distributor does not have a solid European presence.<br/><br/>It's available from the leading Finnish game store chain Fantasiapelit, though. Strange if other stores have less of a selection, although Fantasiapelit is one of those better sorts of stores that buy some from IPR and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
