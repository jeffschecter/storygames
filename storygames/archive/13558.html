I was wondering whether people were still up for this?  The <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Indie-RPG-Meetup-Group" rel="nofollow">London Indie RPG Meetup Group</a> is meeting on 15th Jan (shameless plug) and it would be an opportunity for us to do something.<br/><br/>Are folks still up for this?  If so:<br/>What shall we play?<br/>How shall we sit about and discuss it?<br/><br/>As for the games I'm reasonably flexible, having a vast quantity of unplayed publications that occasionally get used to hold open doors.  I'm keen on the idea of Lady Balckbird, Montsegur or Love in the time of Seid as they all start with reasonably fixed premises.<br/><br/>In terms of reporting we could set up an AP thread.  Maybe one person (not the GM) could also write a post on behalf of the group with members comments liberally dotted through.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/>[Andy K edit: Edited topic: Not really Necro, just further discussion of a topic from a few weeks back; continuing]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306322/#Comment_306322" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T05:36:38+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  5:36AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2010 5:42AM by Graham.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, we should definitely do this.<br/><br/>I'd like to pick a game that hasn't had much play. So, from that point of view, I'm less keen on Lady Blackbird and perhaps even Montsegur. Love in the Time of Seiinsertsymbol isn't bad. <br/><br/>My pick would be Sorcerer, actually. I've never played. I get the feeling it's a game we refer to a lot, but don't play much.<br/><br/>In a similar underplayed-but-talked-about vein: Grey Ranks, A Flower For Mara, Under My Skin, Puppetland, Bacchanal, Over The Edge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306335/#Comment_306335" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T07:15:41+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  7:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham: On a Windows keyboard, it's ALT024.

Especially if we're talking once a month (most can make it once every two weeks or month, so we could alternate this and more-open, pick-up play).<br/><br/>Logistically, we need to work up a play list somewhat in advance (say, three months worth at a time) so folks can plan for, budget, and await shipping of purchases. Or favor free/super-cheap (PDF) games.<br/><br/>I don't have a particular preference, at the moment, other than to (selfishly) pitch for games I own but have not played yet:<br/>* Shab Al-Hiri Roach (sorry, Jason--just haven't gotten a group up)<br/>* Burning Empires (ha! Yeah, right...)<br/>* Dust Devils (could be a problem with being out of print)<br/>* Universalis (never could get a con game to make)<br/>* Sufficiently Advanced<br/>* Solipsist<br/><br/>Games I've played that I'd love to delve into more include:<br/>* Contenders (in a variety of periods!)<br/>* Mechaton (why not minis?)<br/>* the latest Pendragon (not *quite* indie, but very "story")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306363/#Comment_306363" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T08:50:02+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  8:50AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first game will be DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS 2nd EDITION.<br/><br/>Discuss.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306365/#Comment_306365" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-30T08:54:26+00:00" title="December 30, 2010  8:54AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK that was a joke, but something that may get pulled out at some point.<br/><br/>Gimme a day or two to put something together, I've got ideas for game selection, and will hit up folks here and on that old thread in a bit.

One month (considering my own work situation and all) seems almost to harried to sustain, and two months seems to be perhaps a little long. This may change over time, perhaps quickly, based on the first two or so rounds.<br/><br/>* I may include out-of-print books. But whenever at all f'ing possible, it'll be books available for purchase or legal download in PDF/other format. If not, I'll make sure that the product is not sooooper rare/impossible to get for a reasonable price. In my mind, I've already locked (for the future) on the possibility of two regarded games that are OOP but not in PDF format, but are available without too much problem on eBay, Amazon (used) and the like.<br/><br/>* I'm going to try to find a sense of polarity in choices: A balance between games that consider mechanics, scope ("traditional", "hippie" etc), design background, location of the designer globally (if known, in order to draw on various communities), etc. So we might see a more traditional game followed up by a hippie game. <br/><br/>* Having said that, I'll be aiming at games that are more on the hippie end of the spectrum than traditional. This is Story Games (the site) after all, not RPGGeek or RPGNet. If you're here, you're interested in playing those kinds of games. While traditional playstyle games will be introduced from time to time, they'll be usually in the categories of:<br/>-- Free<br/>-- Independent<br/>-- Something unique about it (setting-wise)<br/>-- Something unique about it (rule wise; even if it's just the One Hippie Rule stapled to an Otherwise Tradditty-Trad-Trad game)<br/><br/>* I'll be drawing on lots of free or at least very inexpensive games (you'll see when I announce the first round/format). I don't want this to turn into a Purchasing Club, but a Playing Club.<br/><br/>* Having said that, I'm aiming at games with the promise of (at least in theory) being complete, and no playtest games.<br/><br/>* Just a quick aside, in case folks were wondering: I too will be aiming for games that I haven't played at all (or that much) that look interesting. In case there were fears of "Oprah's Book Club", trying to sell you on the games that only I like or something.<br/><br/>* I'll be offering limited choices in selection. We'll see how that works. See the first round for details when announced.<br/><br/>* The first round is "sho ga nai", but in further rounds I'll try to announce a week or two early to give folks time to procure the games in physical form and all.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306460/#Comment_306460" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-31T09:15:22+00:00" title="December 31, 2010  9:15AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 31, 2010 9:34AM by Andy.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joel</cite>What do y'all think of the format?</blockquote>\nFor now, what I'd encourage is if people want to rock a campaign, that they go ahead and do so, even if that means passing on the Next Month game... but will likely not make it part of the actual format for now. I feel good enough about this project that I can "commit people" to playing 1-2 games in a 4-6 week period: If they didn't like the game, one session was enough; if they like it a lot, they can extend their run a month or more. But committing people to a 3-month game seems difficult at this time. Maybe if it was "choose one of these three games" or something. <br/><br/>Might be worth thinking about again in the summer/"convention season", as things get crazy then and a longer 2-3 month format for an extended campaign (or 1-2 sessions of those three months for folks caught up in the convention circuit) would be better.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306563/#Comment_306563" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-01T23:50:32+00:00" title="January  1, 2011 11:50PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alright, will make something more official-y later on, but for now here's how we're going to start:<br/><br/>Period one will be January 1st (yesterday!) to February 15th. <br/><br/>Intentions: Play at least one session. Drop a report about how the session went, even if it didn't go well. There will be a discussion thread in a bit. <br/><br/>If you want to hack it to use house rules, alternate setting, etc that's your prerogative. However, just note in the discussion what you changed about the game and why.<br/><br/>Now, the whole point of a "game club" is to play a game together and find common discussion, interests, etc. I am currently waffling fully on the aspect of making people buy new games: In a book club, the book is like less than $10(US) and often cheaper used or in libraries; but in the RPG world, games can be significantly more expensive. And yet, I don't want to stick to a certain price range ("All games under $10", "Only Free Games", etc). <br/><br/>So my thought for now is to tag one game of Whatever price, and one game of a price between Free and $5.00 (or thereabouts; strongly swinging towards Free), and let people pick which game they want to play. With six weeks, those that wish to can try doing one session of both, or 1+ sessions of one. There is no push to playing both, I think that if people sign on in for one or the other that we'll have enough people to create a discussion (I'm hoping at least 3 people per game at the minimum).<br/><br/>The official thread will come in a day or two, but if folks want to get a jump on this, here are the games.<br/><br/><b>METROPOLE LUXURY COFFIN</b><br/>( <a href="http://www.thefreerpgblog.com/2010/12/bury-yourself-in-metropole-luxury.html" rel="nofollow">FreeRPGBlog link</a> )<br/>( <a href="http://www.4shared.com/get/1qFpxbir/Metropole_Luxury_Coffin_01.html;jsessionid=38534EF588ED0F7F9A15DCCD841AE889.dc215" rel="nofollow">Direct download link</a> )<br/><br/>and<br/><br/><b>ANNALISE</b><br/>( <a href="http://www.findannalise.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.findannalise.com/</a> )<br/><br/>Again, I'll create an official thread, and from there we can create the discussion threads.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306611/#Comment_306611" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-01-02T17:40:00+00:00" title="January  2, 2011  5:40PM">January 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me the price thing isn't a huge deal...not everyone in the group needs to buy the book.<br/><br/>Anyhow, just so happens I got Annalise last month.
