In the interests of keeping the "data churn" on my end to a minimum, I need to conform to Ron's Official List of Booth Folks in terms of determining whose stuff gets listed in the booth's Demo Menu.  Ron's list is going to be people who've paid him on time.  The deadline on that is past, however, and there are still some folks who have not paid Ron at all.  So I've asked him for another day to let people get it straightened out, and he's agreed.  But this is it; if it's not sorted out by tomorrow afternoon, the third strike has been used up.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo in summary, here's the policy in effect as of this post:<br/>\n<br/>\n- <b>Folks who have not paid Ron and do not do so in the next 24 hours will be stricken from the menu, no second chances.</b><br/>\n- If you aren't sure of your payment status with Ron, you need to <i>contact him right now</i>: <b>sorcerer AT sorcerer-rpg DOT com</b>.  Do it by email; he reads that most often.  Posting to a forum won't help, and asking *me* won't help.  Ron's in charge.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
