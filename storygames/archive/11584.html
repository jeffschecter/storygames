When I write, I have to set ground rules for myself, otherwise I second-guess myself, revise things that don't need revising, or just plain don't commit to putting words on the page. I thought I'd share these rules. They're fun and totally applicable to fantasy gaming. Maybe we can argue about them.<br/><br/>1. Fantasy is inherently an adolescent thing. This isn\u2019t bad or wrong. It just means that fantasy appeals to the adolescent in people. We all still have an adolescent inside of us. This is normal. Without it, we\u2019d be kinda boring.<br/><br/>2. Fantasy is born of the friction between intense, often irrational desire, and the utter disappointments and frustrations presented by the real world. Whatever disappoints you, depresses you, pisses you off about the real world and what you have to do to get by in it, deal with it in your fantasy. Fix it, or, better yet, create environments that allow you to punch it in the face, or, even better, create protagonists who will punch it in the face even in environments that discourage such punching.<br/><br/>3. Why are Tolkien\u2019s protagonists majestic, perseverant, discerning, and/or unconditionally loyal (except when they\u2019re not, but that\u2019s only so they can become so)? Because Tolkien thought those were qualities that people ought to have. <br/><br/>4. Why are Howard\u2019s protagonists unapologetic butt-kickers who don\u2019t take any shit, who are always ready to act even when gravely unprepared, and who take beatings occasionally but bounce right back? Because Howard wanted to be that kind of person.<br/><br/>5. Why are Stan Lee\u2019s protagonists powerful and valiant people who still have to deal with petty squabbles and relatively mundane problems? Because Lee thinks that it\u2019s the concern over those details, and the concern for others (we only squabble with people we care about), that make someone human and thus able to be valiant in the first place. Notice that Dr. Doom and Magneto don\u2019t have to deal with any of that stuff.<br/><br/>6. If an idea scares you, you must use it.<br/><br/>7. If an idea turns you on, you must use it.<br/><br/>8. If an idea grosses you out, you must use it.<br/><br/>9. If an idea makes you go, \u201cGee, golly, wow!\u201d then you must use it.<br/><br/>10. If you come up with an idea that makes you go, \u201cIs that too weird? Is that going to freak people out?\u201d then use it and don\u2019t revise it. What you\u2019re really asking yourself is, \u201cDoes that reveal something about me that I\u2019m afraid of?\u201d If you\u2019re scared of revealing things about yourself, then don\u2019t do fantasy.<br/><br/>11. If an idea doesn\u2019t do any of the above 5 things, it\u2019s probably not worth a damn.<br/><br/>12. A protagonist\u2019s decisions should make you anxious about the consequences.<br/><br/>13. When you see what a protagonist is up against, it had better make you go, \u201cOhhhhhh SHIT.\u201d<br/><br/>14. Every time a protagonist triumphs, it should make you want to pump your fist and shout, \u201cHell yeah!\u201d<br/><br/>15. Every time a protagonist fails, it should have you biting your nails or gaping in disbelief. When he fails, he should suffer. When he suffers, he should suffer horribly.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_258274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/258274/#Comment_258274" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-24T16:43:42+00:00" title="February 24, 2010  4:43PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lev Grossman's recent novel <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Magicians-Novel-Lev-Grossman/dp/0670020559" rel="nofollow">The Magicians</a></i> has a lot to say about points 1 and 2.
