Maybe I'm wrong about this?  <br/>I mean, I'm sure it's an indicator of things besides just game design.<br/><br/>Have you played with any regularity, with folks of a wide span in ages?  <br/>If so, I'd like to read how that went, or if it's still happening; is going.<br/><br/>Thanks, really.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chiarina" title="chiarina"><img alt="chiarina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chiarina">chiarina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474355/#Comment_474355" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-31T18:48:38+00:00" title="May 31, 2018  6:48PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            24 years ago, we started our Ars Magica Campaign. We were students, in our mid twenties. We started with Ars Magica 3rd edition.<br/><br/>Then our studies ended, members of the group continued studying at another place, some got jobs, some stayed at the same location, some moved, we scattered. Our domiciles are perhaps 250 km away from each other. The distance seemed to be conquerable for us. We decided to continue our campaign (and converted our characters and saga to Ars Magica 4th edition).<br/><br/>Now we meet perhaps 6 through 8 times in a year... and become older. Rarely a member of the group quit. Then we searched for an alternate. This alternates generally were younger players. Some years ago we converted to Ars Magica 5th edition. Today our oldest gamer is 52 years old. Our youngest gamer is 24 years old... as old as our saga.<br/><br/>We\xb4re lucky, because the old gamers are glad about the young blood and the young gamers are fond of listening to old anecdotes (at times). The older gamers secure our saga continuity, the younger ones bring new ideas. It\xb4s a good combination for a long campaign, I think.<br/><br/>The saga has a preplanned end date. We\xb4ll reach it in perhaps 8 years. At least I hope so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474391/#Comment_474391" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-01T18:34:08+00:00" title="June  1, 2018  6:34PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My wife and I ran FiranMUX, an online text-based multiplayer role-playing game (running on MUSH/MUX software) for 18 years. The in-game time ran three times RL time, so the game's history spanned about 54 years. <br/><br/>In addition, there were about 10-15 years of in-game time from the previous traditional tabletop campaign enjoyed by a dozen or so players.<br/><br/>The complete storyline, created by staff and players, spanned 65-70 years, and involved thousands of characters.<br/><br/>The game allowed characters to have children, which the game staff selectively turned into playable characters when they reached a reasonable teen age. The longest dynastic line was, I think, five generations.<br/><br/>We shut it down a few years ago.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474393/#Comment_474393" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-01T21:49:08+00:00" title="June  1, 2018  9:49PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Respect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474394/#Comment_474394" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-02T04:34:04+00:00" title="June  2, 2018  4:34AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, no kidding.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474395">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474395/#Comment_474395" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-02T05:27:33+00:00" title="June  2, 2018  5:27AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 2, 2018 5:33AM by DeReel.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I play with the family (8 to 50) once a year but not regularly.
