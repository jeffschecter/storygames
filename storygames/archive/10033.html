They have tons of innovative classroom stuff reasonably priced that can be repurposed for gaming:<br/>\n<br/>\nA few of my favorites:<br/>\n<br/>\nLike This <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.eaieducation.com/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=532600" rel="nofollow">Angle Tracking Ruler</a> A ruler with a circular hinge in the middle that lets you draw precisely mitered angles for dungeon maps or perspective illustrations...$10 for a set of 10 that you can then share with your friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr these <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.eaieducation.com/ProductInfo.aspx?productid=531894" rel="nofollow">Dry/Wet erase graph paper sheets</a> 1cm grids on one side blank on the other.

Salvation Army or Goodwill. People get rid of those things all the time. I have picked up 5 big dry erase boards that average about 4 by 3, and I think I've spent maybe $15 for all of them combined, tax included. It's really easy to pop the metal frame off the sides and use the board on a game table to draw on.

Simply paint (or score and ink) the underside of the acrylic with your 1" squares (or hexes or whatever) and the clip it down to the map or backer cardboard. Done.<br><br>You can also print out a graph paper pattern (made in Gimp or Photoshop) onto poster sheets (Kinkos) and take it to a place with a roll laminator (Kinkos again; often 3 feet wide and N feet long!) and run it through. Voila!<br><br>I actually do this with Hero Clix maps: cut them into 8x8 squares, laminate each square, and then reassemble at the table with a bit of tape. This allows me to rearrange the maps (often double-sided maps) to make new(ish) combat areas.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sol" title="sol"><img alt="sol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sol">sol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223342/#Comment_223342" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T18:27:44+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  6:27PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I found these at a local TeachMe Store. <img alt="image" src="null"/><br><a href="http://www.teachersparadise.com/c/wipeoff-chart-graphing-grid-22-x-28-15-squares-p-8683.html" rel="nofollow">Wipe-On/Wipe-Off Grids</a><br>I had a bit of a nerdgasm though I haven't used them yet. <br>At that price, and size, I could imagine a bunch of them for a dungeon or the like.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234195/#Comment_234195" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-25T00:26:15+00:00" title="September 25, 2009 12:26AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been dilly-dallying around, wanting to reply to this older thread... so a month necro....<br>Here are a random thought of my fun things I've repurposed to game with:<br><br><br>First I'll note some fun gamer shopping places for all this and more.<br>a.  Staples - you'll find all sorts of office-organizing stuff to help for better gaming.<br>b.  Joe-Anne's Fabrics -  cool for all sorts of doodads, beads and boxes to organize and play with.<br>c.  Bed-Bath &amp; Beyond (or the kitchen area of a store) - cool for finding organization stuff and other neat things.<br><br><br>-  a dishrack holder.  I use it to sit on the floor and hold ALL my books while DMing, it's a perfect little shelf angled up at me for reference<br><br>-  any wipe-board, especially the ones you can buy for inside school-lockers.  They're great for secret player notes or info.  Even better for quickly listing and ticking off monster hit points, etc... with a handy dry-erase pen of course.<br><br>-  clip-boards.  I've collected a bunch of old ones and they're handy when to offer to hand out to players when you play from couches, I also use 1-3 during game for myself to clip up different notes: monster stats, pictures, and usually background info.<br><br>-  magic-life-stones.  colored-beads.  I've come to find that Joe-Anne's fabrics can collect you a ton of a dozen colors.  I use them primarily for minion markers when miniatures aren't available quickly.<br><br/>-  cutting boards.  especially solid wooden ones, very handy as a die rolling surface or something<br/><br/>-  bowls.  especially wooden ones! better than cutting boards for die rollers, wooden bowls give that cool "CLAck" sound, I'll often sut and glue felt to the inside of the bottom of the bowl, it feels like a really "die-roller" bowl from Vegas or something.  I've also found some simple neat "bowls" in the office organization area at Staples, simple 5"x5" plastic square bowls then line the bottom with felt... nice.<br/><br/>-  neat cups.  any neat cups or glasses or jars are cool to either use as a die roll-container or for holding beads, pens/pencils, etc...<br/><br/>-  poker chips.  I have some of the nice clay ones, but I prefer using the cheap plastic ones, I spray paint them for different uses as needed, and lately I've been making condition-counters and such to stick onto them.<br/><br/>-  pipe cleaners.  I've found a dozen or more colored pipe cleaners, the bendy kind.  And plan to start using them for blast radius markers, etc...<br/><br/>-  gigantic magnetic wipe board.  I plunked down about $75 and got a nice office-wall sized dry erase wipe board, it's great.  I actually use it for the table flat play surface.  Combined with my old "Tact-Tiles" it makes for a nice game table in front of the couch in the living room.<br/><br/>-  Initiative Marker.  Okay... I made this.  But it's cool.  I made a simple logo page with space for "Character", "Ready", "Delay" and "notes", laminated that and glue-mount it to a magnetic wipe-board (or just a piece of metal if you like).  I then make about 3 dozen little 2"x5" cards and laminate them.  I used sticky magnets (original for business cards) to stick to the back of the cards.  Now I have an Initiative Board Marker, that I can stand up.  I can write on any of it  (for Episode Title or notes on a character),  and magnet/move the cards around for initiatives.  Using the cards to write NPC/PC names on with dry erase markers.  Stand up, magnets hold, move things around for delaying, etc...  ROCK!  I made mine at about 2'x1.5'  No one forgets NPCs or PC names, including me!<br/><br/><br/><br/>okay...<br/>I'm sure there are lots more things I use.  Anyone else?<br/>-kev-                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
