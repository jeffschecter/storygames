I'd like to continue that conversation, because I played in this style recently and ran into some of the problems I remember as being inherent to this style of play. I'm looking for some more good stuff from Eero, since he's been dedicated lately to describing this style of play, but anyone else is welcome to chime in, of course.<br/><br/>So:<br/><br/>I recently played a game of Red Box D&amp;D, and had a very good time. However, there were still some awkward moments arising from GM-determination "fiat", and I'd like to hear your take on the situation.<br/><br/>In this particular game, a group of characters encountered a monster far beyond our ability to defeat. The monster was chasing us through some caverns, and the only obvious exit was a steep chute we had climbed down by letting down a rope. The rope was still there, so it could be used to climb up, but the chute was pretty steep.<br/><br/>The DM asked us what we were going to do: this giant monster is chasing us, and we've run into this dead end. Everyone else decided to try to climb up the chute. I imagined seven people trying to climb a rope simultaneously, and figured that going that way was certain death, so I jumped into the river and hid underwater, holding my breath.<br/><br/>However, the DM's vision of the situation was clearly different--the roll he called for the others to climb the chute was a very easy one. They made it out, no problem, while I was stuck, alone, wet and out of breath, stuck in a cave with this machine of death.<br/><br/>This experience was frustrating, because I felt like I was making smart choices (indeed, in this situation I thought at least half the others would be eaten before they could get far up the chute), but, in fact, turned out to be making a really stupid decision, because I was unaware of the details of the fiction in a way my character would not have been.<br/><br/>That's a perfect example of how "GM fiat" can ruin a "challenge-based" scenario. There's been a whole lot of, "well, if I'd known that was going to turn out like THAT, I would have..." whenever I've played in this style.<br/><br/>How do you avoid this kind of situation? <br/><br/>Eero --<br/><br/>Is there a lot of table chatter, discussion of odds, etc, at the table? How extensive is the "negotiation" you're describing?<br/><br/>In other words, how clear are the "stakes" of any given point of resolution? Because in the traditional, old-school RPG way of play ("rulings, not rules"), that's not a popular practice. Rather, the aim is to keep the game moving quickly, make rulings, and see how they turn out. But whenever I play that way, I run into problems like the one I mentioned in this post. (Which would have been much more of a problem if, say, my character had died because of that decision.)<br/><br/>I look forward to your responses!<br/><br/><br/>(Edit: If anyone doesn't understand where I'm coming from with this thread, click through the link I included in the first sentence of this post and go read the last three posts of that conversation for some context. It HAS been two months, after all...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Novembre" title="Novembre"><img alt="Novembre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Novembre">Novembre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200059/#Comment_200059" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T01:01:07+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  1:01AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I offer my uninformed point of view: would it have been disruptive in any way if the GM told beforehand what the rolls for the two choices were?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200068/#Comment_200068" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T02:29:08+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  2:29AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently designing an old school game (much too young to have experienced anything old school so it's kind of pseudo-nostalgia) and I've gone the route of everything being very unfair and people embracing it.

If there was a good reason for your character to understand the ease of the task then he might have told you, something like this:<br/><br/>Player: 'We'll never make it all out in time. I'm jumping in the river'<br/>GM: "Actually, it looks pretty easy to you. You think you'll probably all make it"<br/>Player: "OK, I climb the rope" <br/><br/>That said, I've also seen players still say "I don't care, I'm jumping in the river anyway". At which point they shouldn't be surprised if they get eaten. The best of these was a whine in a similar situation in a game of Traveller whilst being pursued by armed guards. <br/>Player, with no where obvious and a closing door to nip through, "I drop down and play dead". <br/>GM, "You are in full sight the whole time, are you sure"<br/>Player, "Yes"<br/>GM, "They shoot you", rolls dice, "You're dead"<br/>Player, going up an octave, "But ... but I didn't think bullets were that deadly!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200082/#Comment_200082" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T06:05:50+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  6:05AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My memory isn't perfect, and probably a bit rosy, but I recall back in the day that there was at least some discussion of odds. Sometimes I didn't have a solid idea, and was just looking for a good roll on the dice (and I do remember that sometimes either a very low roll or a very high roll would result in success [blame that on the fact that in D&amp;D, sometimes low is good and sometimes high is good]).<br/><br/>There is also a factor of gaining understanding of the GM. The more you play with a GM, the better you know how he will rule.<br/><br/>Also, GMs who too consistently gave poor odds and made survival hard became known. "Shigawire" Morgan was one such GM. He got to run D&amp;D once at MIT. I just watched, and a good thing too. He had the whole party killed inside of 20 minutes, several through a pit trap with a shigawire (monofilament wire ala Dune) screen that basically pureed you as you fell through it.<br/><br/>Back in the day I also sometimes fudged those rolls. At some point we also started including "divine intervention" rolls.<br/><br/>If my view of the odds was that getting back up the slide was easy, and ducking under water was bad, I probably would have also given some warning with an "are you sure?" even if I didn't have clear odds in mind, or didn't want to share them (perhaps I had something keyed in the water that hadn't been spotted yet).<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200083/#Comment_200083" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T06:26:40+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  6:26AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way to deal with exploring the fictional setup of the challenge is to have negotiation phases that specifically lay out the presentation of the challenge and the solution, elaboration and questioning, and the introduction of unforseen complications.<br/><br/>One way to deal with GM fiat is always to give the players the ability to fall back on dice rolls if they don't agree with the GM's call.

So if a player asks me whether they can climb to safety before the monster gets them, I don't tell them "yes", I tell them "difficulty 20", which the player will then have to accept by rolling before we go forward. This is the negotiation, it's mechanics and fiction together. The player can then ask me, what about if I hid underwater and waited for the monster to go away - and I could tell them that well, seems like you'd have to hold your breath an awfully long time, how about difficulty 30. Then the player can ask more questions or suggest more courses of action, I can tell him more about his options - and I of course can withhold information to create uncertainty: usually I use a modicum of different perception and intelligence checks, and the players call for them as well; there's a sort of convention that the players can roll idea checks to "get a hint", which basically just means that I speculate freely about the situation with them.<br/><br/>The important thing to realize is that this negotiation and exploring the fictional space and how it maps into the rules is build-up for the tactical choices the players make. The GM shouldn't have any reason to be vague or misleading in his description of the situation; what he wants is to present the players with tactical choices, not to make them guess what they're going to do. This is ultimately a matter of values, of creative agenda: if the group is invested in getting entertainment from strategic planning and execution, then that's what they're going to take the game towards. Players make choices only when they are willing to shoulder the consequences of those choices, and the GM strives to offer the players interesting choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200086/#Comment_200086" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T06:45:39+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  6:45AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in this game and had my Magic User try to climb up the passageway rather than jump in the river.<br/><br/>As a datapoint, here's why I chose to try to climb up the passageway:<br/><br/>(1) The passageway was 7' high and the monster was 8'tall, so I knew that he would be slowed trying to get up it.<br/><br/>(2) I knew that there were nasty Lizardmen down the river because my character had fallen into their midst during our previous delve and had to use Rope Trick to escape their clutches.  Since I had no spells left (except for Find Familiar), my only chance was the passageway.<br/><br/>And here are some more wrinkles:<br/><br/>-I think that in this style of play the onus is on the player to pose the "How hard does it look?" questions to the DM.<br/><br/>-Because of this, I should point out that there weren't "just" two choices.  We could have run down the bank, tried to swim up the river (away from the Lizardmen), dropped the treasure so that the monster would stop chasing us, etc., etc.  <br/><br/>-In this gaming group at least, there's a certain reluctance to give advice/make suggestions to other players, because that is sometime read as "criticizing someone's play".  That's partly because of the Old School style and partly because the players rotate in-and-out on a session-by-session basis.<br/><br/>So, I thought that you wanted to jump into the river because you thought it would be interesting/fun and not because you thought it necessarily be effective.  Had I known what you were thinking, I would have said something like: "That leads to the Lizardmen, you should follow us."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200117/#Comment_200117" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T10:25:54+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 10:25AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's process sounds great to me, but I just want to note that that process is only possible if the group is <i>clear</i> on "challenge-first".  I've played in a lot of games that, overall, wound up being challenge-first, but weren't <i>viewed</i> from that angle during play.  For example, the GM who's trying to facilitate realism and in-character POV might say, "You can't tell by looking how hard the climb will be!  Put your weight on it and see if it gives!"  Or, "Sure, hold your breath and find out how long the monster sticks around!"  <br/><br/>You can always try to discuss with another player/GM how such an approach might impede your fun strategic choices... but it'll be a waste of time unless you can agree on basic priorities like "challenge trumps realism".  I could go on all day about why such agreement can be elusive (and for legitimate reasons, not just players being dicks)...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200122/#Comment_200122" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T10:45:16+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 10:45AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a number of experiences like Paul's original post.

However, the further you as player are trying to plan ahead, the more difficult it is to ask and/or predict.  To David Berg's suggestions for realism -- I think that since the PCs had already climbed down that chute, they should have a good idea how difficult it would be.  <br/><br/>In practice, for nearly any GM in more loose, rulings-based games, I found it much more effective to think in terms of "What would the GM like us to do here?" rather than "What would be the realistically best move from my character's point of view?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200128/#Comment_200128" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T11:06:50+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 11:06AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I should note that thinking in terms of what the GM expects is just fine with me. The satisfaction in the game ultimately comes from the interaction and meeting of minds anyway. It's not rare at all for players to make a plan and me as the GM to participate, at least by nodding along, throwing out some obvious obstacles the plan will have to account for, or even thinking aloud about the sort of things I might try myself in the situation. This communal puzzle resolution process becomes particularly genuine because I don't particularly devise solutions in advance (I'm lucky if I've even managed to device the challenge in advance), so I'm just as clueless as the players are when it comes to resolving the problems they face. A good example of this was the recent Tunnels &amp; Trolls convention play <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27783" rel="nofollow">I wrote about</a>: much of the play was about solving the problem of the first "dungeon level", the wilderness. The characters had to learn about the goblins, their routes through the forest and the best methods for fighting them, without me having any particular resolution in mind - I knew what the challenge was, but I had no idea whether it would even be solvable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200132/#Comment_200132" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T11:25:38+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 11:25AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, I've done both:<br/>a) help players puzzle out an optimal solution to a situation that I don't have an answer in mind for, and<br/>b) help players puzzle out the answer I have in mind for a situation,<br/>often in the same game.  <br/><br/>I have also found that (a) can be functional and fun.<br/><br/>I have not enjoyed (b), however.

It's sort of the guiding light of my inspiration as a GM. I've written here before about my dragonslaying simile: I want the game to address the real (believable, genre-appropriate, whatever) challenges of dragonslaying and not some arbitrary rules things. The system has to go to the fiction for answers in other words, which is what might be called realism. Going back to my goblins-in-the-forest challenge up above, the way I determined how large bands of goblins players had to encounter was purely realistic: I'd decided that goblins are worth MR 20 (monster rating; T&amp;T has a one-number monster stat system), and it made sense to me that you'd get something like half a dozen goblins in each band of goblins. This had nothing to do with how capable the player characters were, except for the basic fact that I'd thought that goblin-hunting would be an appropriate generic environment for a 1st-level party. But the actual challenge environment was determined based on realistic considerations.<br/><br/>The thing is, anybody who considers realism and GM preference opposite to each other apparently thinks that the ghost of Gygax will come and correct it if somebody breaks realism - there is no objective realism, there is just what the group accepts as believable. When I say that I use "realistic considerations" in some particular game, it just means that the details of the fiction are a major determinant in the choices I make as a GM, not that I imagine that I have some objective truth in my hands. Tunnels &amp; Trolls provides some good examples of this: the game has rules for setting Saving Roll difficulties that may, depending on edition and reading, be read as suggesting that you should always set the SR difficulty equal to the dungeon level. So jumping over a pit on level 1 is SR 1, on level 2 it's SR 2. Another reading of the rules is that the GM determines the difficulty based on how difficult the feat in question seems to him in the fiction - except that the game doesn't provide a table of example difficulties or anything of the sort, so good luck with developing your own sense of scale for this purpose. Anyway, those two methods for determining SR difficulty are illustrative of what I think of as "formalistic" and "realistic" rules; the latter reference fiction (via a player's interpretation of it, of course), while the former just look at other facts in the rules. A major part of my recent adventure gaming has been about researching highly realistic rules systems, as most Forge-style games tend towards high formalism; it's an interesting change of pace to look into how a realistic game works.<br/><br/>My point here is, I don't particularly see that any of "gaming the GM", realistic considerations or challenge would need to conflict with each other within a single game. The GM may easily make his decisions based on realistic considerations, the players may well try to understand the GM's viewpoint to communicate with him more efficiently, and the game may indeed still be oriented towards introducing and resolving challenges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Calithena" title="Calithena"><img alt="Calithena" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Calithena">Calithena</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200153/#Comment_200153" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T12:46:52+00:00" title="April  2, 2009 12:46PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, I have to remember to come back to this thread later.<br/>\n<br/>\nReal quick - when I see players doing this:<br/>\n<br/>\n"What would the GM like us to do here?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI try to break them of it.

Not only that, but the stuff that happens in our games is often stuff we have no real-life reference for. How hard is it to climb up a rope in a chute while carrying weapons and wearing armor? How hard is it to take your car off a highway ramp at 40 mi/h and land on the other side of the overpass?<br><br>I have no idea, really! Chances are, neither does the GM, or any of the other players at the table. This means that, at any given instance of play, our ideas of how things are and how hard interacting with them might be could clash painfully. <br><br>My point is that in the incident with the chute, no one was wrong. Six or seven people climbing a rope simultaneously up 50 ft. sounds difficult. They'd have to coordinate their actions very carefully. We have no mechanical means of determining how well they are doing that--one GM might say, "okay, you've all determined the most reasonable order, and arranged yourselves appropriately", whereas another might say, "you're all at the mouth of the chute at the same time. Who's willing to knock someone else out of the way to get to the rope first?" Neither is wrong. Likewise, we know the characters' attribute scores, but we don't have a clear real-world reference. Is Strength 9 like a fit but not overly bulky adventurer? Or is it more like "average joe", or even like an "average 20th-century geek"? Are "adventurers" brave, strong warrior types, or just average people thrown into unusual situations? All that impacts how fast we can imagine a person climb a rope. On top of that, we have no objective idea of how close the monster is to us, or how fast it's moving. There's simply not enough detail to be able to agree on any sort of "objective vision" of "what should happen".<br><br>As an example of how this sort of judgement will vary from person to person, I'm pretty sure my own decision and "mental image" of the fiction was heavily influenced by my own life experiences. I've just been reading Zamoyski's "Moscow 1812: Napoleon's Fatal March" (a brilliant piece of scholarship, by the way). The book describes many, many scenes where a group of hungry, tired people try to cross a bridge or even walk through a city gate together. Not under battlefield conditions--just regular marching on a nice, clear day (in many cases; some were much worse). Well, the press of the crowd in many cases is so terrible that <i>thousands</i> of people are killed. Just from a group of people trying to walk through a city gate. Imagining people trying to make it up <i>a single rope</i> while a fire-breathing monster breathes down their back... I was certain it could lead to nothing but immediate slaughter.<br><br>Maybe if my head hadn't been full of imagery from this book, but rather had just returned from a heroic adventure film about superhuman heroes prevailing over desperate odds, I would have considered success much more likely.<br/><br/>But my point is that there isn't a "right" or "wrong" point of view. There simply isn't enough established in the fiction, and usually isn't enough real-life knowledge for the participants to draw on to make an "objective" judgement.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200234/#Comment_200234" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T17:53:17+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  5:53PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continuing]<br/><br/>Dave's discrimination of the two types of games featuring this sort of situation is really spot on: are we trying to model an objective reality, or to provide tactics and challenges?<br/><br/>The problem that I've seen is that the "realistic/immersive" and "challenge-based" paradigms rarely appear as two separate categories. Eero's T&amp;T game sounds like it falls very close to being a pure member of the latter group; Dave's Delve game sounds like a similar "pure" type of the former.<br/><br/>Whenever I've seen people play "old-school"-style dungeon crawl games, coming out of the D&amp;D tradition, however, what I've seen is a very specific attempt to meld those two. The illusion of an "objective" reality and a strict delimitation of character knowledge and player knowledge is being leveraged to a) create a sense of tension and fear in the players and b) create a set of constraints that delimit tactical choices. <br/><br/>In addition, in the example of this particular game, there is a strong emphasis on fast-paced action and this whole sense of limited information. It's a scary game to play! Step into the wrong room and you'll be killed. You have to outwit the DM and cover all your bases--if you don't poke the tile in front of you with a pole first, don't be shocked if it triggers instant death the moment you step on it.<br/><br/>Now, this is a really fun mode of play, and I really enjoyed the game. But these occasional moments of total disconnect <i>always</i> surface for me. The only time I enjoy this style of gaming 100% is when I'm running the game--with total GM powers, of course everything that happens lines up with my imagined "objective" reality.<br/><br/>The solution that Eero and others are suggesting--go to the rules rather than the fiction--is the most obvious solution. In other words, instead of saying, "that's going to be really hard", you say, "that'll take a 20 on your saving throw". This gets everyone on the same page, in a way, as each player can adjust their internal view of the fiction to match the suggested game mechanics. I see that as the most functional solution, and will be trying it in the future.<br/><br/>However, it has a number of drawbacks as well:<br/><br/>1) The pace of the game is much, much slower, if players need to ask about, negotiate, and consider the mechanical details or any important action they want to take. That detracts from the mood of the game, and slows the pace tremendously, compared to the "shout and roll!" school of DM/GMing.<br/>2) Knowing the mechanical "scores" relevant to various actions works against the sense of danger and the sense of mystery that is often the very point of such games. That tense, unpredictable danger is *fun*! Limiting yourself to only what your character would know increases that effect for a lot of people. In my example, my problem wasn't that my character was in trouble. I fully expected that! But seeing the others "get off easy" really ruined my suspension of disbelief, so to speak. Suddenly the fiction I was imagining wasn't making sense to me anymore.<br/>3) The lack of objective information is a valid part of the "challenge". If you know the rolls required to do A, B, and C, that's a whole layer of information you can use to manipulate the challenge. It also can allow a player to interact with the challenge on a rules level, sometimes bypassing the challenge present in the fiction altogether.<br/><br/>Dave and Eero (and anyone else, of course), how do you deal with these types of issues? Are they concerns? When do they come up? What are possible solutions?<br/><br/>How do you do the whole old-school "rulings, not rules" style of play, and make it work? <br/><br/>(One thought I've been trying not to voice, but think I <i>should</i> mention is that Dave and Eero both GM this type of game almost exclusively, rarely or never being on the other side of the screen. Does either of you think that might colour your view of the functionality of this style of play? Honest question; I'm curious, not trying to bait you into a terrible admission or anything like that.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200243">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200243/#Comment_200243" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T18:42:49+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  6:42PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bah, the text is 250 characters too long... easier to cut a paragraph, it wasn't that interesting anyway. As for your list, here's my take:<br/><br/>1) The pace of my game might be slightly slow... except for the fact that I drop many other things to make room for more intricate conflicts and more extended planning/negotiation phases. You can see this in that T&amp;T thread at the Forge, how I bitch about the game's equipment lists which turn attention to the wrong things (from my viewpoint) and slow the game down. Equipment lists and filler combat encounters are just a couple of things that I don't brook in my game, and removing those makes room for a lot of other things. Each challenge in my game is unique and significant, there is no room for those "20% of your resources" encounters modern D&amp;D uses. Easy and unsignificant situations are automatical successes that segue into the next actual challenge situation. All that being said, I'm not 100% certain that my game is any slower than your average immersion-based thing: we save a <i>lot</i> of time in play when I can just skip complex descriptions of things and speak in gamemechanese; this is especially clear when we come to a new situation and I can just tell the players what I was thinking was the challenge in it. The players don't need to play a guessing game and twiddle with the setting to find out which switch makes the price come out.<br/><br/>2) I'm not bothered by mechanics as a layer on top of the fiction, perhaps because it's obvious to me that the mechanics are a needed and wanted part of the game. This is a sort of anti-immersionist stance, I guess: the mechanics formalize and emphasize certain relationships in the fiction, which gives it further structure and makes it pleasurable. For example, I find it enjoyable in D&amp;D-type games that a character succeeds in walking a tightrope <i>because</i> he's dextrous and a 5th level thief. A character gains a bonus to a dice roll <i>because</i> he has a suitable tool to work with. A check is harder <i>because</i> you're trying to carry another person with you. The mechanics are just this sort of cause relationships brought to the fore, they explain to us why things happen in the fiction the way they do. There is no incongruence here towards enjoying the fiction and atmosphere, I find.<br/><br/>3) The player's information might not be complete, and the best challenges cannot be bypassed through the rules. It's important to realize here that I don't even consider a basic combat encounter once the combat has been joined a challenge in most games of D&amp;D tradition. The conflict resolution is not the challenge any more than the conflict resolution is the thematic choice in a narrativistic game. So when I think of a challenge I usually consider some slightly higher-level thing that isn't fully formalized in the rules: beating the guards when breaking into a castle is not the challenge, the challenge is planning the break-in and risking your skin to do it. This really doesn't have much to do with the moment-to-moment resolution, and it's not difficult at all to include unknown factors into it: you didn't know about the monster before it attacked, for example. And if players want more information, they can very well roll for it, again using the mechanics: perception vs. 20, fail and you reveal yourself to the enemy, that sort of thing. And even if the players know all the factors involved, a good challenge isn't any easier to solve, because it's a genuine problem in the fiction and not just the rules: realistically speaking, the people in the setting have trouble with this thing, whether this thing is breaking into a castle or going into a dark pit with a monster or killing a dragon or apprehending a vampire. You just need to answer the question about why this thing is a challenge in the fiction, and the same reason holds no matter how much the players know about the situation or the rules-mechanics related to it.<br/><br/>So yeah, I guess I'm pretty clear on this: whatever the characters know in the fiction, the players should know the related game mechanics. When I hide a roll's difficulty or type from a player it's only because the character doesn't know, either.<br/><br/>As for GMing - it's true that I haven't been on the player side a lot recently. It's something of a problem, mainly because the GM definitely gets his satisfaction from slightly different things than the players do, and can thus have large blind spots about his own performance and how the players perceive it. Ultimately we just have to trust in the honesty and communication of the group; if the other players don't tell us when we're full of shit, then nobody else is going to. For all I know the players are lying to me about being entertained. In fact, I'm often sort of surprised by how a player's enjoyment or disappointment can hinge on some relatively minor thing I'm not even registering myself. Might be that players are trying too hard to give feedback, though, and end up hanging onto inconsequential details - it's actually pretty difficult to get data about your GMing performance from a group without getting all inquisitionary about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200252/#Comment_200252" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-02T19:54:36+00:00" title="April  2, 2009  7:54PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>That's a great, clear description of what play looks like when you're running it.

We had a very functional group several years back, based primarily on interrogating the GM for sense data and analyzing that before making decisions.  Example:<br/>"How wide is the chasm?"<br/>"Fifteen feet."<br/>"Do I think I can jump it?"<br/>"Can you jump fifteen feet?"<br/>"Hmm..."  (discussion ensues, possibly with busting out a tape measure and trying some jumps)<br/><br/>Of course, this is hideously slow in terms of progressing the fiction.  But once you've been doing it for a while, it's not as bad as it sounds.  Interrogating the GM about distances, relative positions, lighting conditions, etc. became a finely-honed science.  <br/><br/>The GM taught us to play this way by playing "no takebacks" on character action annoucements -- if you said, "I charge forward!" without asking what was in front of you, you might run off a cliff and die.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's one example, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it for everyone.  More generally, I have some thoughts on Eero's POV on mechanics:<br/><br/>Although it is certainly possible to express an in-game reality in mechanics terms (a Climb Difficulty-12 wall), some players like to encounter this reality the way their characters do -- through sense impressions.  Basically, I want enough visual detail to say, "Okay, looking at this as my character, it'll be tough to climb, but not impossible."  Whereas the guy sitting next to me will say, "Dude, just tell me the difficulty, and if I feel like imagining what that might look like, I will!"  Attempting to appease me will bore him, and attempting to appease him will make me feel an unwelcome distance from the fiction (i.e. "not immersed enough").<br/><br/>Further, these player tastes can change depending on (among other things) the situation in the fiction, and how much time is left in the play session!  Trying to provide the optimal level of detail as a GM is rough.

It's simply because I can't make the choice neutrally if I know what the player rolled. Sometimes the eager ones have to reroll to ensure the sanctity of the procedure.<br/><br/>Also, obviously the rigor of the method depends on how intense play is.

I don't really like this. It makes it seem less real. A few people might know how much they can benchpress and how fast they can run under perfect circumstances but this isn't generally what life is like. Part of the interest, for me, comes in not knowing.<br/><br/>So when it comes to the jump I will say "it's easy", "it's hard" or "you think you can make it, but not with that backpack and plate mail", or similar phrases. This is an indication to the player as to whether it will be a DEX+2, DEX-4 or DEX roll (-5 for plate, -2 for pack).<br/><br/>I don't think is GM fiat though, I think it's improvised scenario creation. I don't sit in a GMs ivory tower, I'm out there with the players making a good game.<br/><br/>There was an interesting situation in this regard the game last week. The 3,000,000xp+ team had gone on a shadow walk and on a 5% chance bumped into something nasty. I had printouts from the free Book of Beings II monster manual and so used one of them, a Void Demon, a rather hornery critter than can dissolve anything that hits it.<br/><br/>One of the players who is massively gung-ho in a way that really drives the game forward stepped up to the challenge and started beating the critter up with his massively magical god-sword. Then he found out he had to make a save against disintegration every time he hit the creature or lose his sword. So when he was rolling, he would roll the dice and then say whether it was the save or the roll to hit, massively reducing the chance of losing his sword. I knew what he was doing and he probably knew I knew. But was there any point in making him do things differently? Would that have increased the fun? No. Having a chance of losing his weapon was a frisson, but actually losing it would have been terrible. Obviously it could also have been an opportunity for a side-quest to recover the sword but that wasn't what we were playing that time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H." title="Daniel H."><img alt="Daniel H." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/127/nSFC1IW2D2A06.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20H.">Daniel H.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200367/#Comment_200367" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T08:17:01+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  8:17AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>That's why I made<a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</blockquote>\nBoy, you really took that to the next level since the last time I saw it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200411/#Comment_200411" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T11:16:21+00:00" title="April  3, 2009 11:16AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>[...]<br/>In this particular game, a group of characters encountered a monster far beyond our ability to defeat. The monster was chasing us through some caverns, and the only obvious exit was a steep chute we had climbed down by letting down a rope. The rope was still there, so it could be used to climb up, but the chute was pretty steep.<br/><br/>The DM asked us what we were going to do: this giant monster is chasing us, and we've run into this dead end. Everyone else decided to try to climb up the chute. I imagined seven people trying to climb a rope simultaneously, and figured that going that way was certain death, so I jumped into the river and hid underwater, holding my breath.<br/><br/>However, the DM's vision of the situation was clearly different--the roll he called for the others to climb the chute was a very easy one. They made it out, no problem, while I was stuck, alone, wet and out of breath, stuck in a cave with this machine of death.<br/><br/>This experience was frustrating, because I felt like I was making smart choices (indeed, in this situation I thought at least half the others would be eaten before they could get far up the chute), but, in fact, turned out to be making a really stupid decision, because I was unaware of the details of the fiction in a way my character would not have been.<br/><br/>That's a perfect example of how "GM fiat" can ruin a "challenge-based" scenario. There's been a whole lot of, "well, if I'd known that was going to turn out like THAT, I would have..." whenever I've played in this style.<br/>[...]<br/></blockquote>\nNone of us were at the table and can truly say for certain. But I haven't seen anyone else say what's on my mind here.<br/><br/>The GM asked "what do you do", right? That means the sandbox is open for business. If he wanted to keep the game on the rails, he should have said "make your Climbing roll". By asking the open-ended question, any reasonable course of action should have a reasonable chance of success.  Am I correct that you had zero chance of success and your character died?<br/><br/>The overwhelming nature of the monster is a clue to me that the GM wanted to force the adventure down a particular path.

This isn't just about fiat, as everyone has noted throughout this thread, there's really no feasible line between GM fiat and campaign design or adjudication.  What there is, instead, is a management of perceptions.  There were any number of ways the GM could have cued you that the rope was easier to climb than you thought it would be, ranging from an NPC scurrying up it quickly, to just "The rope hangs, awaiting your ascent" in the style of a movie that tells us where the characters are going to go by zooming in on the place where they're going and having the score go "waaaah!!!"  <br/><br/>And Grant is right, if there was really no choice about which way to go, that should have been made clear too.  GMs that create situations with only one way out are relatively rare, though.  Virtually always when my players tell me "Gah, we had no choice!" I always think "Are you fucking stupid, you had like a billion choices".  It's not that they're fucking stupid, it's that they didn't perceive the choices as feasible even though I did and even though <i>I am the one who decides what's feasible.</i>  This is the exact opposite problem of you thinking the river was feasible when it wasn't.  Just because you're a GM doesn't mean you get across everything you are trying to get across, and the GM can be just as frustrated by that as the players when things break down.<br/><br/>Now sometimes no matter what the GM says or does your internal view of the game is going to push you in another direction.  Like, the GM flat tells you, "Hey, the rope is really easy to climb" and you say "Uh, no, it's not, it's incredibly hard, I'm going for the river" and the GM says "The river, what, no, the monster will eat you" and you say "it's the most feasible option".  This is pretty much what we mean by My Guy syndrome.  You have an internal view of the game world and you can't bring yourself to re-evaluate it and you don't want to break it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200430/#Comment_200430" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T12:04:37+00:00" title="April  3, 2009 12:04PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Grant Davis</cite>None of us were at the table and can truly say for certain.</blockquote>\nActually, I was there, too!<br/><br/>Just to give some extra context (not meant to deflect/defuse any theoretical concerns):<br/><br/>One of the interesting things was that the DM really didn't have any particular solution in mind.  We're playing through a module, so the DM isn't even the person who designed the encounter.  Paul's character ended up surviving - although he did have to ditch his treasure and he also had a close call with some lizardmen, so it definitely wasn't a "climb the rope or die" situation.<br/><br/>And in previous sessions, we've had players pull their fat out of the fire in very interesting, unconventional, and not-at-all-immediately obvious ways.  We've also had characters (4 I think) die trying to fend off large bats (which are like half-HD creatures).  So, at the time, it wasn't immediately apparent to me (and probably to the table as a whole - including the DM) whether or not Paul's action would be a case of the former or a case like the latter.<br/><br/>As it turned out, I think Paul gained a qualified success.  He didn't escape with the treasure, but he did manage to turn the monster against some of our "enemies" in the dungeon.  And his character survived.

In this particular case, my character not only survived, but managed to cause the death of six lizardmen (no easy feat in this game, even for a large group of PCs) and get back up to the surface with a scroll of some kind (potentially valuable and/or interesting). So, things turned out really well for him--although there were several rolls that could have ended his career in those fifteen minutes or so.<br/><br/>In my view, the DM actually "went soft" on all of us--not only on those who escaped but on my character, as well. However, as Dave pointed out, that has a lot to do with all kinds of factors we normally don't discuss. In this case, the night was growing late, and we knew we had to wrap up soon. Allowing the PCs to escape rather than having to draw things out and end on a sour note may have been on the DM's mind (perhaps even without it being a conscious decision).<br/><br/>I have a few comments, however, about some of the other things mentioned up above:\n<blockquote><br/>So when it comes to the jump I will say "it's easy", "it's hard" or "you think you can make it, but not with that backpack and plate mail", or similar phrases. This is an indication to the player as to whether it will be a DEX+2, DEX-4 or DEX roll (-5 for plate, -2 for pack).<br/></blockquote>\nThe various solutions discussed are all pretty good:<br/><br/>* Be transparent about the mechanical challenges involved, get everyone on the same page, negotiate if necessary. <br/><br/>Ex: <br/>--"Ok, you'll need to roll a 15. And if you roll a ciritical failure, you'll lose your backpack. OK?" <br/>--"You said it was only 10 ft. high!" <br/>--"Ok, then, 14. Cool?" <br/>--"Let's go!"<br/><br/>* Discuss the probability of various challenges, but keep the mechanics hidden. So, "it's REALLY hard" instead of "you need a 15".<br/><br/>* Only discuss the probability of challenges based on what the *characters* know. May use game terms of "real life" terms, as above.<br/><br/>All these are good techniques. However, I've seen them fail time and again, and require retconning. For example, in a battle, I may concoct a plan to ambush the enemy by hiding my soldiers in the high grass East of the battlefield. But, let's say I only come up with this idea later, in the middle of things, and it only ends up happening because of the outcome of roll X after roll Y, and only because the enemy did something last-minute to make that possible. So we didn't discuss the specifics earlier in play, thinking it unlikely to come up.<br/><br/>When the enemy comes by the tall grass, they spot the soldiers immediately--perhaps automatically, perhaps because the GM is rolling "behind the screen" and assigned them a bonus. <br/><br/>Turns out the GM was picturing the "tall grass" as being 3 feet tall, whereas the player had assumed "tall grass" meant 6 feet tall. Do we have an argument? Do we go back to the beginning of the battle, three real-time hours ago, when the troops were being set up?<br/><br/>I _always_ see this kind of thing crop up in this style of gaming. Do the processes you guys are describing prevent them effectively? All the time? Most of the time? Some of the time?<br/><br/>If they crop up for you as they do in my experience, how do you deal with them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200448/#Comment_200448" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T12:42:46+00:00" title="April  3, 2009 12:42PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So Paul's character had more adventure and made it though.

Like, the GM flat tells you, "Hey, the rope is really easy to climb" and you say "Uh, no, it's not, it's incredibly hard, I'm going for the river" and the GM says "The river, what, no, the monster will eat you" and you say "it's the most feasible option".  This is pretty much what we mean by My Guy syndrome.  You have an internal view of the game world and you can't bring yourself to re-evaluate it and you don't want to break it.</blockquote>\nThis is interesting!<br/><br/>Because, after experiencing a lot of frustration of the sort we're discussing here, I came to a different conclusion.<br/><br/>Here's the thing:<br/><br/>Whose "internal view of the game" is more important? The player's? The GM's? Who's doing this "My Guy" thing and refusing to re-evaluate their internal view?<br/><br/>How do we decide whose "internal view" is more important?<br/><br/>The traditional view, I think, has been that the GM is king. I've found much more satisfaction in my own gaming by shifting that attitude to assume that the player's view is actually more important. They have more at stake, and less flexibility in adjusting tactics to go after what they want. This means there is more "retconning" and discussion necessary when a player's judgement of the situation has to be adjusted, and more frustration.<br/><br/>When I tend rather to give any tactic that seems logical to the player a chance of success, and adjust my view accordingly, I've had much smoother gaming. You stop having endless frustration and arguments, and usually it's not that hard for the GM to adjust their view a little bit. Players get to maintain their sense of "immersion", if that's a priority, and can continue to make meaningful tactical choices within the fiction.<br/><br/>Like, if someone says, "I want to climb the tower to get a better shot at the enemy", and I was imagining that there was actually a building between the tower and the battlefield, making such a shot impossible, I tend to say, "sure", instead, and adjust <i>my</i> vision. Unless the position of the tower had been clearly defined for everyone earlier in the game, of course. In that case, the player has forgotten, and made a serious tactical error. But I tend to err in the players' favour in such a situation. After all, as the GM, I have much more leeway to adjust the situation to make it remains challenging, and the game can go on, the players' cleverness rewarded, and everyone still enjoying themselves.<br/><br/>So, the GM adjusting to make player-side tactics effective: I think that's what happened to some extent in this D&amp;D game, actually, as witnessed by all the characters' survival.<br/><br/>(Sometimes it works the other way, too, though:)<br/><br/>--"I search for traps!" <br/>--"Hmmm... the player is right! If the traitor had planned to trap someone, this is exactly the spot where he would have placed a trap."<br/>(And now the player may have to deal with a trap the GM had not early planned to place in this location.)<br/><br/>edited for clarity                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200450">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200450/#Comment_200450" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T12:50:11+00:00" title="April  3, 2009 12:50PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was running GURPS awhile back, but someone else would have to judge how strict I was.

I suppose that I'd catch this sort of thing when the player starts executing: presumably he'd tell me that he's trying to hide his soldiers in the high grass, at which point I'd comment on the rules feasibility of that - the difficulty of seeing them, the difficulty of hiding, whatever, depends on the system. So it'd be up to the player to then decide whether the cover of the grass is good enough for his plan; even if there'd be a chance for the enemy to discover his men (and if he knew the perception checks the enemy would likely be rolling, then he could straight out know the probability), he might still go for it if he judged the benefit worth the risk.<br/><br/>This sort of thing can backfire on you when the players hide their thoughts and intentions, which is why I'm adamantly opposed to that sort of adversial play: it always ends up biting the player himself in the ass and nobody else if he starts playing the task resolution game and doesn't outright tell me what he's trying to accomplish; without that information I can't catch it if he has misunderstood something about my description of the situation. With the high grass situation I'd probably ask the player what he imagines hiding in the grass to accomplish, but there are other situations where it is easy to misunderstand what a player is trying to do until the last moment when he reveals the plan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200452/#Comment_200452" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T12:53:06+00:00" title="April  3, 2009 12:53PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul types really fast.

The characters are being chased by this deadly beast. They come to a fork in the road. They know from prior experience that the left branch means they'll have to climb up a chute, jump over a chasm, then get up a ladder to make it out of the monster's reach. The right branch has a river, then another branch, the left part of it leading to a room half-full of water, the other unknown.<br/><br/>A lot of these challenges have been traversed before, but never while running from a monster (whose own ability to cross these obstacles is not known).<br/><br/>Now imagine you're the GM!<br/><br/>The players are going to have to decide which way to go at this fork, and the monster is breathing down their necks. <br/><br/>What does the conversation look like? What kind of information passes from person to person?<br/><br/>In most "old-school" games I've experienced, including this one, there is little discussion, as the priority is to "stay immersed" and/or to keep the pace of the game moving quickly. The GM says, "which way do you go?" and the players respond with "left" or "right".<br/><br/>How do you do it?

Actually, I had something like that happen in Keep on the Shadowfell about a year ago... I tried to play it pretty much the way we're sketching out here: competitively, imaginatively and setting-based. So my character ended up constantly doing things that apparently were completely idiotic in the setting (the rules, actually; in that game the rules define the setting), it's just that nobody told me this, so the character ended up failing all the time. This ranged from trying to use a disguise to bypass some monsters to trying to do long-range scouting to trying to interrogate villagers... generally speaking everything and anything I tried failed so bad that one would think that my character would know to not even try.<br/><br/>As for Paul's example, it'd depend on whether urgency were a part of the current challenge to my mind. I might require the players to choose their route without undue delay as the sort of little subgame that GMs do. If the characters have a little bit of time this probably wouldn't cross my mind and I'd allow the players to open the floor for a full-blown conference, topic "how do we escape the monster". In the latter case a player would probably want to know whether the monster can climb, jump, etc., and I'd allow a suitable roll to find out whether somebody happens to know about it. The players might also ask me to remind them about the difficulties of the climbs and jumps and whatnot on either route, which I'd probably provide: I like the idea that the players are enticed to try to strategize their way out of near-certain death, perhaps by splitting the party and having the athletic characters try to lead the monster towards the pit, which they can then cross while the less able ones sneak elsewhere. (Just what came to mind to myself; I'd probably say this plan aloud the moment I think of it - suggesting things has the positive effect of provoking discussion of tactics and pointing out places where players actually have choices, when otherwise they might just blindly go with the "obvious" solution and never question whether they might do better.)<br/><br/>Most likely, however, the naturally emerging leader of the PC posse would just make a call on either branch of the tunnel without extended discussion, I believe. Players tend to go into conferencing mode in slightly more controlled situations, especially when they know that the GM has the option to hasten the decision-making process. If I wanted to encourage a conference on monster-avoidance, I'd probably have the monster delayed somehow while giving the players some suggestions for different strategies they might try. I often do all sorts of leading questions like "Are you going to escape the way you came, then, or will you brave one of the unexplored passages?" This is all to promote and emphasize the key content of the game, which is facing and resolving challenges by luck, gut, strategy and tactics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200483/#Comment_200483" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T14:56:12+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  2:56PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>That's why I made <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</blockquote>\nWoah!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200487/#Comment_200487" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T15:13:43+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  3:13PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>That's why I made<a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">this</a>.</blockquote>\nWoah!<br/><br/>Yes, Dan and John, that's right.

That kind of decision depends on so many things that may not have been established in detail (e.g. the exact size of the pit, what "athletic" means in this game or this setting, and the size and agility of the monster) that's it's easy to run into situations like what you're describing in the D&amp;D 4e game. <br/><br/>I've outlined my solution, above--if the characters think that jumping across the pit is a good tactic to escape the monster, I'll give it a chance of success. That is, assuming all those factors have been undetermined. If the pit's width is known, and the monsters ability to leap across pits (or lack thereof) has been established, that's different story!<br/><br/>I wonder if there's some bit of GMing wisdom you're using that you haven't described yet. You know how we all do things (sometimes good things, sometimes bad things) without realizing we're doing them? Because we assume that's just "the way you play the game"...<br/><br/>In any case, from what I've seen of "old school" tactical challenge-based adventuring, I'd say the amount of negotiation and conversation you're describing is very, very rare. All the games I've seen tend towards quick decisions, a few dice rolled behind a screen, and then the declaration of the outcome--often within 10 seconds from the announcement of the danger or problem to the final outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200493/#Comment_200493" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T15:42:55+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  3:42PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, probably I'm not describing something, because I don't quite see the problem. The players already know how difficult the pit is to cross if their characters have already crossed it or at least seen it once. They also might have some idea of whether the monster can cross the pit or not based on whether they've seen the monster or not (and on whether the monster has hidden qualities such as levitation, of course). The players have all the parts of the puzzle except the ones that have been left in the dark due to what their characters are still to discover. They can try actions to gain more information if the situation allows, but if it doesn't, they have to essentially trust luck and sensible, conservative planning. Sometimes wrong choices are made due to limited knowledge, but that's just as valid a way to lose a challenge as losing at dice would be. The only really problematic way for a challenge to get lost is when the GM can't turn the result into significant progress for the adventure, but that's really rare for me now in the age of conflict resolution and scene framing.<br/><br/>It's true that in some situations the GM doesn't have anything determined, of course. If I end up in this sort of situation without having made any decisions, I often engage the whole group to figure out the situation, or at least signal the players that I'll have to make some judgment calls they should be ready to question if they seem screwy. Something like "I'm not quite sure if the drake stalking you can fly in these tunnels, what do you think?" When we determine the monster's ability to cross the pit depends on when we need the knowledge, and who makes the decision depends on who has the requisite knowledge - often it's the GM, but the players do have rights to parts of the setting as well. For example, I don't usually interfere with character equipment, it's up to the players to determine what their characters have with them. The same goes for a character's past - it's no skin off my nose if a player declares that his character used to in fact live in Nepal and thus is familiar with the language. Usually these choices are made with character integrity in mind on the player side, and even when they are not, it's hardly the end of the world: we just got to learn new things about the character's past. This is key when considering the GM side as well: just like the player will respect character integrity when describing his character's resources, the GM will respect setting integrity when describing the environment.<br/><br/>Ah, one more technique I've used lately: when I don't care for some particular of the setting or want to signal strongly that it's essentially random and might be different at another time, I've started rolling "the die of fate". Usually this is just a 50/50 randomization for the particular in question. For example, I might declare that "Usually there'd be guards at this junction, let's see how it is at this time, odds will mean guards... ah, seems like they have gone away for now." This is an available technique with the monster at the crossroads as well - if we don't know yet what the monster is, I might give alternatives and roll to see if it's the sort that can cross pits. At least the players will have a very difficult time getting the mistaken impression that I have any clue as to where the game is going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200495/#Comment_200495" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-03T15:50:18+00:00" title="April  3, 2009  3:50PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmm. What I'm describing are situations where the outcome appears "completely obvious" to one person at the table... and equally unambiguous to another person, but they don't share that idea at all.<br/><br/>The example I wrote up seems hypothetical, perhaps, but it's exactly the same as what happened in the D&amp;D game. Sure, the monster had been described to us--as a "huge, black, humanoid statue that shoots fire from its mouth". But that doesn't tell us exactly how tall it is, or what proportion its legs have to its body, or how agile and/or flexible a magically animated statue is---everyone's imagining something different here. Furthermore, while we'd already crossed the pit (in our case, the chute), we did so in the other direction, one at a time, and without being rushed. If it had been a pit, we might have crossed it be placing a log or a ladder across it, for instance.<br/><br/>All this leaves different people with different impressions of what the situation actually is and what "should happen". I don't know if that clarifies my question.<br/><br/>I like your suggestions about keeping the GM's mental process out in the open.

It's mostly an issue for the GM in this sort of thing.<br/><br/>So, when you're playing a game (any game; roleplaying, board, video, whatever) with win/loss conditions, it is important that losers <i>know why they lost</i>. They have to know where they went wrong, what decisions they made were foolish, and/or where the random whims of fate were against them. Loss must be an opportunity to learn and improve, so that the loser can get back in the game armed with more experience and knowledge, and thus be better able to step up to the challenge.<br/><br/>The factors leading to loss must be appreciable. If necessary, they should even be explained <i>at the time of the loss</i>.<br/><br/>Furthermore, it's important that nobody ever loses because of factors that they had no influence over at all. Ending up in a hopelessly fatal situation is okay if it happens because you made a wrong choice; but if there's no way to avoid it, that's pointless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201307/#Comment_201307" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-08T14:55:04+00:00" title="April  8, 2009  2:55PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, yeah, 'cause if the rules of the game are concretely defined and unchanging, as in video games, we know what the rules are.

A proper gamist game really should have clearly lineated goalposts and aftergame analysis so the players can actually see what they've done. This is one thing I'm not happy with in the current state of the art fantasy adventure games; you can do this thing if you know to, but the closest these games come in this regard is the largely informal loot division and spending binge that the players have after the party survives alive out of the dungeon and gets into the town. It'd probably be smart to use that opportunity to go over the choices made through the scenario with the GM, looking at his notes and figuring out what could have been done better.<br/><br/>And this is totally something that I am <i>not</i> doing right now. Obvious, but it's so much easier to play according to the methods of the current game that it requires a deliberate act of game design to try something new.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201496/#Comment_201496" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-09T22:50:53+00:00" title="April  9, 2009 10:50PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Applying Marshall's observation to Paul's quandary, you get this:<br/><br/><b>GM:</b> It's a huge, black, humanoid statue that shoots fire from its mouth!<br/><b>Player 1: </b>A statue, eh?

a strategy with full awareness of the in-fiction options &amp; situation, the task of clarifying becomes more delicate.  Offer more info too firmly and the players will take it as "GM's telling me he doesn't think that'll work, and will thus arbitrate my attempt harshly", even if that's not your intent.  I often wind up doing something like this:<br/><br/><b>Player 1:</b>A statue, eh?  I think I'll try to roll between its legs!  Then I'll have free shots on it's back while it clunkily tries to turn around!<br/><b>GM:</b>From the way it's charging, it's not <i>obviously</i> stiff.  Slower than a human, for sure, and maybe a little stiff, but not fused joints or anything.  You could definitely give it a shot, but it's hard to tell how much trouble it would have turning around.  Maybe some, maybe not much.<br/><br/>My easy rule of thumb is "tell the player what the character perceives", but this instance called for more elaboration on what the perception is telling them.  My buddy Al tends to do this without providing the whole "I reach into your character's head and tell you how you interpret your perceptions" thing, but he's better at providing tactical info through pure physical description than I am.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201561/#Comment_201561" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T15:48:22+00:00" title="April 10, 2009  3:48PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For all the difficulties this problem seems to cause some people, you've only covered the easy scenario: physical challenges, like those you would usually experience in fantasy adventures. My prime AP example for this phenomenon comes from Call of Cthulhu, which is definitely challenge-based, rather Old School (as I interpret the term, at least), but consisting mostly of social or mental challenges. Further, there are few dungeon-like scenario structures to constrain options and reign the characters in, leaving them open to try ideas the GM may not even consider to be within the realms of possibility.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an example of the dissonance possible in this setup, in this particular scenario (set in 1920s New England, of course) the players were required to retrieve some building plans from the archive of a municipal office. Due to time pressures, the four PCs each had a clue-gathering task to perform, and only one of them would be able to visit the archive. There was an aging businessman, a flamboyant romance novelist, an African jazz musician and an academic/archaeologist - it was decided the archaeologist, having lots of experience dealing with institutions and digging through old records, would hit up the archive. For full disclosure, I was playing the businessman, and had no part in this scene as either player or GM.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM arbitrarily decided it was near closing time when the PC arrived, making the sole staff of the archive reluctant to go digging through the basement for the plans. That, to my mind, was the setup of the challenge: convince the staff to fetch the records despite the inconvenience it would cause her.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe GM wasn't too keen on just rolling Persuasion against some difficulty, being of the mindset that player role-play performance should give a bonus or penalty to social skill rolls. So the scene commences.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, it just so happened that the archaeologist was a woman, and the GM ruled that would automatically make most people suspicious towards her. To his mind, 1920s women were typically demure and low-profile, and the PC was anything but. She was also an academic of high repute, which was certainly a rarity in that day and age. So when he portrays the archive staff lady, it was with a great deal of apprehension. The conversation goes something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\n"I'd like to see the records of the Such-and-Such-Manor in Some-Such-Ville."<br/>\n"Oh, those records are in the basement, ma'am, and I'm closing up here in just ten minutes and there are others who need to be served. You'll have to be back tomorrow."<br/>\n"Now wait a minute, I was here before close and I need to see these records. Couldn't you just let me in to the basement? I know my way around a library."<br/>\n"I'm sorry but I cannot let you past this door, ma'am. You'll have to be back tomorrow when I have more time."<br/>\n"Here now, I'm part of the faculty of archaeology at Yale - I'm not going to mess up your paperwork or steal anything. I'll be in and out, not to worry."<br/>\n&lt;peers suspiciously at the PC&gt; "You'll have to be going now, ma'am. I really can't help you."<br/>\n"As I understand it, it's your job to fetch me these records..."<br/>\n"I'll have to call police if you don't leave right now."<br/>\n"This is ridiculous. Just let me in to the basement and I'll get the records, then you can serve these fine folk who are waiting for you..."<br/>\n&lt;calls police who comes to take away the archaeologist for causing a public disturbance&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\nAt no point were dice rolls made to test the archaeologist's considerable Persuasion, Credit Rating (=reputation), Library Use or what have you, despite the player's willingness to do so.<br/>\n<br/>\nSimilar moments of confusion between players and GM were sprinkled throughout the session, mostly with regards to unhelpful officials who reacted poorly towards the PCs' antics.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the session we discussed these concerns with the GM. His stance was simply that "such behaviour would be considered completely outrageous in the 1920s - dice rolls have nothing to do with it". This is a far more difficult point to argue than "what's the difficulty of a three-foot-tall Halfling scaling a ten-foot brick wall", because there is no right - or even approximately right - answer. In 1920s New England, a "realistic" answer to the issue above would require advanced, specialized understanding of psychology, history, and labour law. Neither GM nor players possessed this knowledge, and even if they did, it's highly questionable whether a realistic answer would be useful in the context of playing a fun RPG session with friends.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only answer I can come up with is that the GM should have changed his mind about what is and what isn't feasible at the very moment the players decided to send the archaeologist (rather than, say, the author) to the archive. By doing that, they're saying "we as a group believe the archaeologist's status as an academic and her good Library Use will be more beneficial to the task of retrieving the plans than her tendency of being a straight-shooting woman who refuses to follow the Man's rules will be a detriment." This may well change the setting the GM has in mind - maybe even drift the theme of the game into something more pulpy heroic - but so be it. I see this as very similar to Paul's <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=200449" rel="nofollow">comment</a> about whose interpretation is more important, the players' or the GM's.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, I think this is a fundamental issue in creating functional play. You either have an explicit system for it written in the game, or the group creates their own system (in the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://random.average-bear.com/TheoryTopics/LumpleyPrinciple" rel="nofollow">Lumpley Principle</a> sense) for it, or play cannot occur at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201583/#Comment_201583" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T21:21:27+00:00" title="April 10, 2009  9:21PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2009 9:24PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Honestly, I think this:<br><i><br>Players communicate intent before committing to action, GM responds with relevant info.</br></i><br><br>covers that too.  Here's how I'd envision it:<br><br><b>Player: </b>We've decided the archaeologist, having lots of experience dealing with institutions and digging through old records, should hit up the archive. <br><b>GM:</b> Yeah, she'd know what to do once she got in.  However, you know that women sometimes face great difficulty getting into places.  This is the 1920s, after all.<br><br>So, let's say the players decide to go for it anyway.  The GM needs to determine whether they have a chance, or whether this is a dead end.  <br><br><b>If it's a dead end</b>, it's easy enough to signal that unequivocally.  The players have been prepared for this possibility by "women sometimes face great difficulty getting into places", so they will probably read the signals quickly enough and move on to try something else.<br><br>A Persuasion roll against some impossible difficulty number might be a nice option, but certainly isn't the only one.<br><br><b>If they have a chance</b>, but the PCs need to do more than just show up, then this is a challenge, and the GM needs to frame it as such.  A <i>good</i> social challenge looks a lot like a good physical challenge:<br><br><b>Player:</b> Well, reasoning isn't getting anywhere, but this archivist seems kind of skittish.  Maybe I'll try intimidating her.<br><b>GM:</b> She's skittish, but she's also been eyeing the phone and turning toward it.  It might not take much to make her call for help.  So ask yourself how far you want to go to intimidate her.<br><b>Player:</b>  Well, I'm not gonna physically stop her from calling the cops.  Hmm.  Maybe a bribe?  How's she dressed?<br><b>GM:</b> She looks dirt poor.<br><b>Player: </b> Oh, and she said earlier that she cares nothing for this institution, right?<br><b>GM: </b> That's right!<br><br>In this case, the GM has in mind a solution, but he doesn't just lead the players straight to it.  If he said, "You think bribery might work", or had the archivist babble on non-stop about how much she needs money, then it wouldn't be a challenge.  However, as the players propose solutions, the GM makes sure to give them all the info the characters would have.  (Once the players conceive of the best solution, depending on how obvious it winds up looking, the challenge may be effectively "beaten" right there, before implementation.  This is still satisfying, in my experience.)<br><br>Lachek, I've had similar experiences to what you describe.  Ultimately, though, I think it comes down to GMs not treating social challenges the way they treat physical ones, in either clarity of "yes, this is a challenge" or in attention to the process of beating it.  Mentioning that the bribe-able archivist is poor and detached is just as important as mentioning that the monster's made of stone.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_201586">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201586/#Comment_201586" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-10T21:47:22+00:00" title="April 10, 2009  9:47PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2009 10:04PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>The only answer I can come up with is that the GM should have changed his mind about what is and what isn't feasible at the very moment the players decided to send the archaeologist (rather than, say, the author) to the archive.

Are the players saying, "We're asserting some setting authority!" or are they saying, "Here's our solution to a challenge!"?<br><br>If it's already been established that these players want setting authority, great.  Hopefully, everyone knows what's up, and the GM will clarify if he's not sure.  "I was thinking women have it rough.  Do you guys not want that?"<br><br/>If, on the other hand, this group runs with the "old school" model of "GM as sole setting authority", then the players had better announce if they're deviating from that.  Make an explicit request.  "Women have it rough?  We don't like that.  Can we change it?"\n<blockquote>whose interpretation is more important, the players' or the GM's</blockquote>The interpretation just needs to be <i>agreed on and communicated</i>.  Who gets authority over it is a matter of taste from game to game, group to group.<br/><br/>Paul's example of the player climbing the tower to snipe is a really interesting sharing of authority.  GM conceives a set of facts, GM communicates part of that set, player fills in some blanks, player does something that indicates how they've filled in the blanks, GM adjusts conceived-but-not-communicated facts to accord with player's fill-ins.  Authority goes to whoever narrates first, but the GM has veto power, and should use it on any players who are deliberately creating setting from an omniscient POV rather than filling in perceptions from a character POV.                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_201604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/201604/#Comment_201604" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-11T09:53:07+00:00" title="April 11, 2009  9:53AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2009 9:56AM by Marshall Burns.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, if the GM makes rulings, they have to be based on principles, and the players need to be aware of this fact.

Here's my current working theory on making judgment calls (including but not limited to GM rulings) a functional part of play:<br/><br/>What's important is A) the <i>purpose</i> of making a judgment call at this time, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> whether or not that purpose is appropriate, understood, and bought into. (What is "appropriate" depends on the game at hand, and particularly on the game's reward cycle). You run into problems when A is not known or is ignored, and/or when the "value" of B, so to speak, is "not appropriate/not understood/not bought into." A is an issue for the judger, and B is an issue for everyone else.<br/><br/>In old-school, challenge-based play, the GM for makes judgment calls as part of his job to provide an engaging challenge for the players. This is not the same thing as trying to kill the PCs, or even as competing with the players; rather, the point is to shape a situation such that the players must be crafty and clever, or else fail (which may entail dying, but that's a side effect). Dumb choices are often punished by judgment calls that cause problems, while clever, crafty choices are often rewarded by judgment calls that are good for the player. The GM's <i>criteria</i> in this is another issue, and may be based on principles that are abstract or naturalistic, or any combination thereof. And, to repeat myself, in this style of play, the criteria have to reveal themselves so that the players can learn to perform better.<br/><br/>You <i>also</i> run into problems when the judgment call is not made in a <i>language</i> that everyone understands. F'rinstance, saying "the grass is tall" when nobody is sure exactly how tall that is. What is needed for this is clarity in what I call (in my head, since I've never really written about it) "Expression techniques," which are any techniques that we use to express things in the SIS in <i>actionable</i> terms. Sometimes it's plain speech ("I grab the sword," from which we now know that the sword is in your hand) sometimes it's in mechanical points and stuff ("The grass is tall for 3d12," a statement that you'd find in playing <i>Super Action Now!</i>, tells us that the grass is tall, and that tallness has a pretty good chance to have an impact on things).<br/><br/>That's what I think, at any rate.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202326/#Comment_202326" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T14:41:52+00:00" title="April 16, 2009  2:41PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jon,<br/>Which one is the "White Box"?

Can the purpose and the criteria <i>really</i> clash, or is it just a matter of the judge not paying ample enough attention to one of them?<br/><br/>Back when I played "Misadventures in Nowhere" in high school -- the game that has mutated and split off into the Rustbelt and the dungeon thing from my "dungeon fever" thread -- my criteria was based heavily on real-world causality. It probably helped that we were all AP physics students, which obviated a lot of arguing about physics. It also helped that the system used provided Expression techniques that were deep and precise (the downside to that being a lot of search &amp; handling time), so that I could make my judgment calls in a language that was understood.<br/><br/>But it was like this: "Given that (for instance) bullets are deadly and unpredictable, what's the best strategy in [this situation in which guns are drawn]?"<br/><br/>What I mean is, I had my criteria in place -- which were heavily naturalistic -- and I engineered challenges based on that. I didn't think of it in those terms at the time; my awareness of these issues has grown since then, but I had at least some instinctual knowledge of these things, enough to keep us afloat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202489/#Comment_202489" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-17T12:56:19+00:00" title="April 17, 2009 12:56PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To be clear: my theory about the A &amp; B and purpose and all that, I'm not married to it.

This is because of communication issues, for one thing, as described above, but also because of the Creative Agenda clash of realism versus challenge.  Purely Narrativist play is most likely to produce in-play fiction that actually resembles the way a novel, movie or TV show would go, but purely Gamist (or possibly Simulationist in the vein of Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries) play can do this as well for certain types of adventure fiction.  Purely Simulationist in the sense of "realistically model a world" is unlikely to produce play whose fictional content feels like most other fiction, for the simple reason that most fiction focuses on things that Sim play does not.<br/><br/>Add to that the weird hybrid of Gam and Sim for which Old School generally, but, I would argue futilely, strives, and it seems inevitable that moments of frustration like the ones described by Paul T. (D&amp;D) and Lachek (CoC) will occur.  Let me also state that I think what Eero is doing, while very fun for him and possibly for his players as well, isn't truly Old School because he's simply being "too" transparent.  I mean, *I* think transparency is a good thing, but it violates the Old School ethos pretty hard.<br/><br/>It may be that, if you want to avoid those instances of dissonance, you simply have to pick one agenda and stick to it faithfully, despite the downsides.  Adherence to Gamist priorities (making the challenge interesting) does mean that you will occasionally get something that doesn't make a lot of sense in terms of setting verisimilitude, or, more likely (and either less or more problematically depending on your tastes), you will have situations where players are distanced from the fiction by spending time thinking about things like bonuses to their die rolls and other purely numerical, mechanical considerations.  Strict Simulationism will lead to players not having enough information to make meaningful decisions, since that's "what would happen," and, inevitably, characters dying in not-very-interesting-or-meaningful ways (more on that below).  (And strict adherence to Narr priorities has its own problems, to be sure, especially for players of certain tastes; Narr games break our intuitions about fictional sources less frequently, at least at the level of fictional outcomes).<br/><br/>Why am I focusing so much on whether or not the in-game fiction models other types of fiction we are familiar with?  Because, lacking other referents (like being an expert in astrophysics in a space travel game or being an expert in medieval combat in a fantasy adventure game), we tend to turn to movies and books in the same genre as the RPG for our intuitions about what "should" or what "might" happen.<br/><br/>In general, for example, in most fiction main characters aren't randomly killed by Third Goblin From the Left, but in extremely faithful Sim or Gam play this could easily happen.  (For an interesting take on something very much like this happening on a TV show, see Samuel T. Anders' arc in season 4.5 of BSG.)<br/><br/>I do think it's possible to have blended-agenda-supporting games, but a) Old School play ain't it and b) you still have to prioritize one mode of play and make the other one secondary to it.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202687/#Comment_202687" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-19T15:40:02+00:00" title="April 19, 2009  3:40PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, I don't claim to be doing Old School gaming, or be writing about it. Some of my play through the last year might have been Old School (notably our brief experimentation with Mentzer D&amp;D), but for the most part I've been happy to explore my own thing, which might or might not resemble what somebody else is doing. Perhaps I'll get some finished game text out of this at some point, but for now it's just me trying to put together what I like or don't like in adventure gaming. Reading my blog, it sometimes seems that there's more I dislike than there is of the other stuff. And really, for the last several weeks I've played just TSoY and not any challenge-based games.<br/><br/>But that aside, I agree that expectations of genre have great sway over the minds of the players of roleplaying games. Couldn't probably be otherwise, considering how closely allied roleplaying is to fiction. In my play we've usually gotten over this sort of thing by clear communication and a readiness on the part of the players to gamble a bit and accept outcomes with good grace. Telling a player his odds of success with a given strategy, to the extent that his character would know, does really help a lot in clearing the pitfalls of differing expectations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202701/#Comment_202701" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-19T20:28:20+00:00" title="April 19, 2009  8:28PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with everything you're saying, Eero (and I get that you aren't necessarily aiming for the "Authentic Old School Experience" in your challenge-based gaming), except this bit:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>But that aside, I agree that expectations of genre have great sway over the minds of the players of roleplaying games.

But I think that historically it's a very frought alliance, full of betrayals, double-dealing, illusion, deception, and bait-and-switch tactics.  How hard is it, in D&amp;D, to have a battle as awesome and significant and dramatic as Helm's Deep?  How much harder is it to have a character death as weighty and meaningful as Boromir's?  And yet, lots of people are turned on to D&amp;D by Lord of the Rings and similar fiction.  (And one could say similar things about Lovecraft, Howard, vampire fiction, etc.)  If your (generic "you") game doesn't have rules that operate at the story structure level, well, you're probably not going to get play that looks much like the stories that inspired the game.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202709/#Comment_202709" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-19T23:39:44+00:00" title="April 19, 2009 11:39PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think some people like that, Matt.

I agree that genre in roleplaying is a deeply problematic and often dysfunctional facet, but I'm not certain that it can be avoided; perhaps we are imprisoned by a need to form a genre to contextualize our exceptions when we spin narratives, just the same as we do when we listen to a storyteller. Genre might be a necessary precondition to understanding the content of roleplaying and creating it, in other words.<br/><br/>But that's nitpicking, I understand the basic point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202769/#Comment_202769" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T12:15:45+00:00" title="April 20, 2009 12:15PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2009 12:18PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heh heh, I've been writing about how to work with this problematic goal set, and <i>now</i> Matt (Deliverator) comes along to expose why it's problematic in the first place.<br/><br/>I was worried that by introducing "realism" and as "example conflicting priority" I might veer off into a Sim/Gam clash.  But I guess it's pertinent here.  Most of the "I do it this way and it works" accounts I've been tossing about are for play that is either strategy-infused Sim or immersive Gamism, but possibly not for a confused hybrid of the two.  I think Matt is quite right in associating that confusion with "old school play".<br/><br/>As for genre reference, I also agree that "what would realistically happen here?" is horribly mute on any sort of satisfying fictional form.  My own attempt to navigate this and produce satisfying Sim play is twofold:<br/>1) what gets played?<br/>2) what types of situations to seed the setting with?<br/><br/>Just because plausible causality determines what <i>happens</i> doesn't say anything about <i>coverage</i>.  Play through the "right" parts, and you get something closer to a good story.  The <a href="http://www.shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">pacing dial</a> is one tool in that direction, to let the players focus the gaming experience on the good stuff.  Often enough, "the good stuff" is what you might find in a book and "the rest" is the part that'd be omitted.<br/><br/>As for situation types, I find that I can satisfy my players' old school jonesing by gravitating toward some combo of <b>(a)</b> providing dangerous risks, <b>(b)</b> providing cleverness challenges, <b>(c)</b> providing special, secret, empowering info, <b>(d)</b> providing ties and connections to the setting, and <b>(e)</b> providing rewards that change the characters' relationship to the setting as a whole in a "more empowered" direction.  <br/><br/>As for what kind of fiction that adds up to resemble, I really am kinda stumped.  Indiana Jones fits well in some ways, X-Files in others, and of course there's Lord of the Rings on the color front.  "Heroic fantasy" is a good name for high-powered, realism-lite stuff, but is kind of useless as reference for gritty play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202803/#Comment_202803" name="Item_74" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T14:38:34+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  2:38PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If the game's going to be "realistic," it needs to define what "realistic" is.
