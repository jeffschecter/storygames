Feel free to mention your game even if you've talked about it in last month's thread. The idea is to inform us about what you're doing now.<br/><br/>* Optionally: tell us what you're hoping to achieve this month or what you did last month.<br/><br/>* If you want to link to another thread, post, or rules document, go for it.<br/><br/>* There's no maximum number of games you can talk about. If developing your game is a genuine focus for you this month, then put it up. <br/><br/><br/><b>If you're responding to a game someone else has posted about:</b><br/><br/>* Number your response (first response: [1]; second response [2]; third response [3]). If you see that you're the second person to post, "Wow, that looks cool!" to a post here, then put a "[2]" at the top of your post. <br/><br/>* The fourth person to post should just take their comment and create a new thread (or talk on an existing thread about the game), to continue the discussion.<br/><br/><br/><b>Previous Threads</b><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/19943/games-in-playtesting-development-january-2015" rel="nofollow">January 2015</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20002/games-in-playtesting-development-february-2015" rel="nofollow">February 2015</a><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20064/games-in-playtesting-development-march-2015" rel="nofollow">March 2015</a><br/><a href="story-games.com/forums/discussion/20129/games-in-playtesting-development-april-2015" rel="nofollow">April 2015</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445173/#Comment_445173" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-10T05:02:47+00:00" title="May 10, 2015  5:02AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been working on and playtesting a hardboiled detective cyberpunk game I've been calling <i>Hardwired</i> while I try to think of a better title that doesn't rip off a book title.

Didn't mean to actually put it out there for that, but my daughter loved the game so much I thought it might be worth working on.  <br/><br/>It's a pretty basic setting free game that was designed to bring back how I felt when I started role playing, when rules were to be ignored, flights of fancy were king, and everything was resolved with one roll.  Although the rules that are in the game are there to teach basic roleplaying ideas, like target numbers, dice sizes, using traits/aspects/skills, role playing itself, etc. <br/><br/>Because of how we raise our daughter I had to write the game without referencing fighting/violence/swords/slaying/killing, etc but making it so other play groups could use it for that.  It is interesting to walk that line as a parent.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445194/#Comment_445194" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-11T19:40:19+00:00" title="May 11, 2015  7:40PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I finally got my large group play test of The Extraordinarily Horrible Children of Raven's Hollow!  Nine players!  I'm glad I did it as it revealed a structural problem that doesn't happen in smaller groups.  So that got fixed.<br/><br/>Also got two play tests of Haunted in.  The game is intense!  In fact, it's TOO intense.  I'm installing a few mechanisms that I hope will encourage a more even passing rather than an emotional collapse under a ton of stressful bricks.<br/><br/>The big goal for this month is the local Gamex Convention.  Two more play tests for Raven's Hollow and Haunted.  I'm really hoping to calling Raven's Hollow "done" from a design stand point soon.  Haunted might need more work than I anticipated but we'll see how the new pacing mechanics work out.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DavidC" title="DavidC"><img alt="DavidC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DavidC">DavidC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445195/#Comment_445195" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-11T22:03:51+00:00" title="May 11, 2015 10:03PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am working on Adventure Deck System: Luminosity with a buddy who doesn't post here.<br/><br/>Last month we made a big push to make the GM side of the game work a lot better, especially for people who aren't us.  GM's story tools are now grouped into a specific obstacle (for example: Monsters chewed through a cable) and into a keyword (complications, sabotage, attacks, defenses, traps and environment.  We also better explained how to use those in a non-combat way. Ex: an attack could be an insult or revealing an embarrassing truth, a defense could be dismissing or disproving that "attack." <br/><br/>This next month, I'd like to get out the alpha rules for using ADS in a fantasy setting, as right now it's wholly focused on Sci-Fi.  The eventual goal is to have 4-5 working settings so that a GM could do a time-travellers or dimensional "mash-up" setting (like Stephen King's dark tower).  <br/><br/>Btw, Adventure Deck System references the actual core game, and Luminosity references a setting where monsters thrive in darkness, and the heroes must try to keep the lights working all night.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445196/#Comment_445196" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-12T00:20:39+00:00" title="May 12, 2015 12:20AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every single one of these games sounds amazing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've laid out <i>Soth</i> (my game of cultists vs. investigators) and I'm doing an penultimate editing pass right now before locking the pagination.<br/><br/>I want to release it this month, which will require laying out art and creating another game trailer for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445200/#Comment_445200" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-12T09:05:11+00:00" title="May 12, 2015  9:05AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yesterday I had the idea for an OSR-ish game based on the bandits of north-eastern Brazil in the early 20th century.

RECON is the first RPG I ever owned, the first game I ever ran, and probably the game that had the most influence on me before I ran into real indie RPGS. However, RECON was blatantly pro-military and heavily toed the right-wing party line of the 1980s, so it conspicuously avoided talking about anything but training, equipment, missions and techniques. It was about soldiers winning or losing missions, not soldiers as people and missions as stories. I kinda want to avoid that.<br/><br/>PATROL takes place in missions with timespans of days or even weeks. Each turn, regardless of what is happening (combat, marching, interacting with locals) takes a half hour in-universe. This means how far you can travel in a day is well-established in the basic rules, there's concrete rules for consuming supplies, and an engagement can go for hours, break off due to changing weather or nightfall, etc.<br/><br/>The other unique part of the game is that each character has a chart of status effects that advance with the turns (a roundel is used for tracking it) or events. So there's rules for hunger, exhaustion, thirst, wounds, morale and ammunition shortage that all function on the same framework. The game is very much about conserving resources, because you very rapidly burn through everything you need and you only have what you can carry.<br/><br/>As your Status Effects advance, you add up all the values on the chart to get a value called your Fatigue, basically how Done you are with Vietnam at this moment. You basically need to offset your Fatigue with Victory Points at the end of the Mission, or you end up losing XP and degrading as a character. Mission objectives give you some Victory Points, but the rest you get through your Alignment. There are four Alignments representing basic outlooks towards the war and each one unlocks new methods of gaining Victory Points as your Fatigue rises, but these methods are usually either impractical, counterproductive, or morally dubious. So, for example, a Principled character with a high Fatigue can get VPs by throwing their weapon away or letting the enemy escape; a Righteous character can get VPs by firing on surrendering enemies.<br/><br/>The game is basically done and has been tested with myself at the helm, but I'm looking for folks to do a blind test while I clean up and rebalance the nitty-gritty elements of equipment, weather and terrain effects, write out the wordy portions, and assemble the PDF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445266">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meinberg" title="Meinberg"><img alt="Meinberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meinberg">Meinberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445266/#Comment_445266" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-18T01:04:53+00:00" title="May 18, 2015  1:04AM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently working on <i>Goat Song</i>, a game about emulating the action and structure of the ancient Athenian stage. I'm currently working on developing it towards the beta stage for open playtesting, but it's been a labor getting all of the pieces in place so that I don't have to explain everything.<br/><br/>It pulls heavy inspiration from Polaris, though uses a more traditional means of conflict resolution, closer in line with Fate. And the Nemesis role is an internal foe, rather than an external one, somewhat similar to the Shadowguide from Wraith: the Oblivion. Hopefully I'll be able to preserve the main arc of the Athenian tragedy, though, of the great person dragged down by their own failings to face Catharsis at the climax of their story.\n<blockquote>Every single one of these games sounds amazing <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've laid out <i>Soth</i> (my game of cultists vs. investigators) and I'm doing an penultimate editing pass right now before locking the pagination.<br/><br/>I want to release it this month, which will require laying out art and creating another game trailer for it.</blockquote>\n[1] The last time I saw Soth it was pretty swanky.

It is a rules light, post-apocalyptic, 18th century feel game about secret agents.<br/><br/>This far I have translated the quick start rules and setting overview. It's not much, but together with adventures and pregens, it was part of the kit I gave to GMs who were unfamiliar with the game but wanted to run it at conventions.<br/><br/><a href="https://wilhelmsgames.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/hostdimma-in-english-translation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://wilhelmsgames.wordpress.com/2015/05/13/hostdimma-in-english-translation</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
