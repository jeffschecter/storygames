I got to play a lot of games, none of which I had played before. I also got in two playtests of Boarsdraft. The playtests were very helpful but the post playtest discussions were also very useful. I played with two groups of different players who were able to bring a range of gameing history and knowledge into the game and show me where my mechanics were broken and difficult. One difficulty that kept cropping up again and again was the limited nature of the skills. As it stands right now the skills players can use are the classes they take, which is a concit I really like. The problem that the playtesters kept running into was that the class list I was useing was pulled directly from the Harry Potter books. I always knew that I would have to make changes to that list for copyright reasons, what the playtests revealed was that I would also need to make changes based on player needs. For one thing there is no class (and no skill) for just talking to people. I encouraged the players to be a bit liberal with the names of classes in order to fill that gap but Charms just does not fit in most situations. I already have some ideas about what to move, combine and add. <br/><br/>The simplest fix, and the most obvious once the players started engageing the system, was how I had been frameing conflicts. My original design was focused on makeing sure that each player got enough spotlight time which I did by haveing the players take turns engageing the system. What was obvious once I got things moveing was that the group should be engageing the system not the individuals. I still want individual players to be able to go off and do their own thing if they want to but I need to rewrite the rules to bring the focus more onto group conflicts. <br/><br/>Building in group conflicts solved a big design hole I hadn't even been aware of and did it wonderfully, but it also highlighted another issue at the same time. The issue was players risking different resources to accomplish the same task. Fictionaly it made a lot of sense and "felt right" at the table. It hid another issue benieth it which did not come up but I will need to deal with. What if different players want to get different things 'out' of the conflict?  On the surface I'm inclined to just say that it is ok as long as the player can justify it fictionaly. My problem is in how best to convey that idea to a first time game master who is playing with a highly charismatic player who is able to justify almost anything to his friends. I understand that this is a corner case and may not be relevent to most groups but it is on my mind. <br/><br/>Another issue that came up in play was advancement. In the rules I brought advancement was a seporate system from conflict all together. We played that way until half way through the first session and then had to stop and hash it out. It became clear that haveing the two system seporated was causing two issues with the game. First, unless the players left the mystery unsolved they would end up failing all their classes. Thats a tough choice and I wanted to force tough choices but, to be honest I had imagined players haveing one class at the end of a year or maybe two that they were really in jepordy of failing. The second problem was that there was a big incentive to simply min/max every conflict so that the players could use only the skills they were good at. We talked about it and made a change right there that fixed the problem for that session and for the other playtest I ran but added difficulty to the future. <br/><br/>Let me discuss the solution before I get into the potential problems. The solution was two part and simple. First, players earned checks each time they used a skill or trait and when they had as many checks as they had points currently in that skill or trait that skill or trait went up. Second all study was postponed to a cram session at the end of the adventure. This felt right fictionaly and led to the players being able to finish the adventure and only two players failing one class a peice. Great! Woot! I fixed my adventure!  But I added a problem I hadn't expected to have to fix. <br/><br/>The problem is balancing that speed of advancement against the fact that the game is designed to run in a seven year arc. Just doing the math in my head I can see the players maxing out their skills and traits in four years and feeling weak. I came up with a lot of potential solutions and my thinking right now is to combine two of them. The first solution that feels right is to make the players double how many checks they need to advance a skill. So to advance a skill from three to four would require six checks. The second is double the cap on skills and traits. Right now the cap is seven, but I'm thinking a cap of fourteen would be better. That is alot of realestate (28 checks) I will need to find room for on my character sheets. If that isn't doable or if it makes the character sheets too large I can always steal another bit from Burning Wheel and make the players earn an even number of failues and successes to raise a skill. If I went with that I would keep the cap at seven which would mean I would only need fourteen checks beside each skill and trait. <br/><br/>Thinking about it as I'm writeing this I've decided to go with the second solution because it solves another min/max issue. The players in a sense set their own difficulty by how much they are willing to risk. With out a good reason players have no reason to risk dangerously and actualy loose resourses which by later years would mean that players could have an almost limitless supply of resources to risk and lots of dice to defend those risks. By forcing them to loose as often as they win the pools of resource will hopefully be kept in check. Another benifit may also be that the fiction will feel more organic but that remains to be seen. I worry that it will feel de-protagonizing to some players but hopefully becouse the players will be chooseing when to really go for failure that won't happen. <br/><br/>A problem I had with the system that no one brought up was the limit I placed on what players could risk. I'm not sure that it was as obvious to the players as it was to me but that limitation made the game seem stilted. I think I'm going to open that up a bit more and allow players to risk any of their resourses at any time. I also want to open up what players can attempt to gain and add in an 'unlocking' element where players have to take on other kinds of challenges before they attempt investigation and once they have investigated it becomes locked again. But once the players have finished investigateing and revealed the BBEG they unlock 'takeing action' which allows them to go after the BBEG. It is something I will have to play around with but I like the feel. <br/><br/>The last big issue I want to cover was risking into investigation. One of my players mentioned that they felt very 'meh' every time the group risked their resources against investigation becouse she couldn't tell how vital the clues were that they were getting out of it. It was a very valid concern and it mirrored a concern I had about how best to advise game masters on how to dole out clues. The solution hit me as I was driveing home, investigation depletes a resourse that the GM has called Mystery. Each year the Mystery gets a bit bigger giving the GM a bit more to play with and allows the whole group a chance to pace the year. This had been a nebulous idea in my head until now and I think it is vital that the Mystery pool be something visual (a pool of tokens perhaps) so that everyone can see how close to the end of the year the group is getting. <br/><br/>There were lots of other tidbits that I need to deal with but I think those are the biggest ones. I'd like to encourage all of my players to come on and discuss any of the changes I mentioned and also to talk about any other insights they may have had after they left the table. Every one else feel free to jump in as well with comments and suggestions! <br/><br/>Cross posted to Praxis, RPG.net, and ATG blog.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326073/#Comment_326073" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T06:22:17+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  6:22AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I updated the Character Sheets to match the rules changes I made.

You would get your checks throughout the session, but you don't actually level up until the end of the semester, then, you roll to study classes without enough checks, but you just automatically pass the classes with enough checks. This not only gives the player incentive to use weaker skills, but it also gives you a simple upper-limiter to keep skills age-appropriate. Then, all the checks are erased at the beginning of the next semester (except for classes you failed, which you can level up anytime you get enough checks during the next semester).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326296/#Comment_326296" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T08:39:39+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  8:39AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Theres something there I like.

I was going to point the individual back to my inital post when I first started working on the project. Bad idea. The game has changed so much over the past few months and that post was so vague that it really would not have been helpful. And so I decided it was time to do a post on what Boarsdraft is today.\xa0<br/><br/>So what is Boarsdraft? \xa0Boarsdraft is a game where you can gain a reputation as a know-it-all by failing to make a new friend or make a new friend by putting your popularity on the line. The only thing that is certain at Boarsdraft is that there is always someone willing to put the students in danger to get what they want. Are you cunning and brave enough to stop them? \xa0Are you willing to risk your friends and free time to keep evil at bay? \xa0I hope you are becouse at Boarsdraft, evil may be your newest teacher, your best friend, or some deep magic long hidden in the depths of the school itself.\xa0<br/><br/>At it's very core Boarsdraft is an roleplaying game for doing Harry Potter style stories. The core mechanics of the game are risk and reward, where players risk the things that matter to them in the hopes of gaining different things. The players use traits, skills, spells and potions to defeat the obsticles to getting what they want. The ammount the players risk (and hope to gain) sets the difficulty which the players must overcome with their skills and traits. Useing skills and traits helps players advance so they can take on riskier tasks later on.\xa0<br/><br/>All the while there is someone up to no good in Boarsdraft castle and it is up to the players to find out who. The players must investigate mysteries to discover the plot and in the end put a stop to it. The speed of investigation helps to pace each year.\xa0                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326394/#Comment_326394" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T17:12:54+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  5:12PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite>Theres something there I like.

All I know about this is what I have read in this thread.)<br/><br/>What if you could use those extra checks to help other players in need of a little edge to level up? (As when Hermione had over-studied and would help the other two with their assignments.) Maybe not something for them to success automatically, but by giving them a higher chance (a bonus or something).<br/><br/>"Hey! I ended up a couple of checks below. I guess I'll fail that class."

I might be able to encourage that kind of shareing by makeing the effort pool disapear every year after the last session. That makes a good kind of sense.

The current page count is 24 pages and I'm just starting on the scenes chapter. I've done the introduction, character creation, traits and skills sections. Just for reference I'm going with a 6 by 9 inch layout with fairly large margins so that I have room to add in hand written notes which will include spells and commentary from former students. Once I get done with the scenes chapter I'll be diveing into the spells. When I'm done with spells I will be done with everything I hope to get done on this pass through and will be ready for some more playtests. I expect the current document will weigh in at arround 32 pages. While I'm waiting on getting playtest feedback I will be working on advice chapters for both players and Head Masters. I'll also spend that time figuring out just what I want to write in the margines.  I expect when it is all said and done the whole book should be about 64-100 pages with plenty of art work to help break up the reading and to make the chapters flow better. Let me just make a note about art here for a moment. The art in the book will (I hope) do two things. First it will help reinforce the theme of both the book and the section where it appears. Second it will provide more of the feel that the reader is reading an in game artifact. I intend to doodle all over certain peices of artwork in the book to emphisize what the reader is seeing and reading. The text of the book is fairly neutral in tone and supportive of the staff and school. The commenter is, on the other hand, critical and easily ammused. The goal here is to make the reader feel like the book they have is a hand-me-down copy of a book that was written at the school itself. I know I still have a lot of work ahead of me here but I'm really enjoying the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon" title="JBMannon"><img alt="JBMannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JBMannon">JBMannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327695/#Comment_327695" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T15:23:14+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  3:23PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Boarsdraft is a game where you play teen witches and wizards trying to make friends, learn spells and pass classes while evil tries to destroy your school, friends, and life.\xa0 I invite you and your gaming group to come and join Boarsdraft School of Wizardry.\xa0 You can download the Boarsdraft PDF, Progress Report (character sheet), Risks and Rewards sheets or if you prefer you can download all of it at once as a Zip file.\xa0 For those who prefer a physical version I have put Boarsdraft up on Lulu for the price of printing (zero profit).

With Dracon's long research into immortality with his lover Risaria, the other founders knew that it would be difficult to keep him from achieving his goal. Risaria and Urza ploted together and divised a way that Dracon might be trapped. There plan required Madris to distract Dracon while the other two founders worked their magics. There was a mighty duel and much of the castle was damaged or destroyed as Madris and Dracon battled each other. Finally, as Madris' strength failed her and it looked as though Dracon might kill her upon the top of the highest tower, Risaria and Urza finished their spell. Dracon was pulled apart into millions of tiny bits and pulled into a large white stone from which, the founders hoped, he would never escape. After this Urza left the school and was never heard from again. Madris and Risaria took the white rock and sealed it away in a part of the castle which was closed up during the repairs.\xa0<br/><br/>Many rumors about what happened still float around the world still to this day. The most popular being that Dracon and Urza fought over Risaria becouse they were both in love with her. The tale says that when Risaria declared her love of Madris the two men abandoned the school in disgust and both men died in relitive annonimity.\xa0<br/><br/>The most far fetched idea that is still rather popular is that Dracon killed Urza with a black, magical stone and then ran off never to be seen again and the two remaining founders fell in love during their grief.\xa0<br/><br/>All of this I have read and been taught and all of it is a lie! \xa0<br/><br/>I have seen the two stones.\xa0<br/><br/>The voice. The shadow. The Dragon                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
