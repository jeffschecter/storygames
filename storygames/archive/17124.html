Bad habits worked as normal and each player was given 5 survival points at the start, to split between their three characters anyway they wished.<br/><br/>The big change I made to GMing was something that lifted it's inspiration from AW and its hacks: I decided that I wasn't going to roll dice! This meant that I didn't have to stat the monsters up fully, just pick a couple of abilities off the list and they were ready to go. When the monsters did anything, I had the players roll their Reactive stat to see if they could prevent it.<br/><br/>This seat-of-my-pants hack burned through plot even faster than I expected, reaching a climax in little more than an hour, when 'Spiffy' was persuaded by his manservant that he would have to marry the Zombie bride that had gatecrashed the garden party with her horde, in order to put the undead to rest. Given that at least one of the players had never seen DoN before, it was an impressively fast game and made a perfect little time filler; for a longer timeslot, I think I'd just raise the number of Survival points the monsters started with and maybe make the players pick flaws for their characters, which would work as anti-specialities, allowing the GM to roll an extra d10 and replace one of the player's results with it if they chose.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_388683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388683/#Comment_388683" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T07:26:09+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  7:26AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was a great game, thanks to James and the other players. I liked the way we had a stable of characters and burned through them. You might consider removing the characters from player ownership, like in Remember Tomorrow: put all the characters in the middle, and players can pull out the ones they want to play at the moment. <br/><br/>The other way to slow the pacing would be to expand the range of the tension meter so that we took a bit longer getting towards the zombie assault.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388692/#Comment_388692" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T08:26:51+00:00" title="August 29, 2012  8:26AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That'd be cool, too.

And when the character you're playing uses a bad habit, it must <b>immediately</b> cause another character, held by another player, to be placed in danger? Or, more interestingly, a bad habit immediately places <i>that</i> character in danger, so you as a player might gain a survival point but the character you were using could die as a result!<br/><br/>Food for thought... I might have to try a bit of this again at Concrete Cow, to mop any floating gamers in the afternoon; we could guarantee players a game on the spot, no matter what time of day they turned up!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_388712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/388712/#Comment_388712" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-29T11:55:34+00:00" title="August 29, 2012 11:55AM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thought is that the survival points would stay with the character, the same as we played it last night.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
