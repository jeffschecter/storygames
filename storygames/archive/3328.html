That its hard to "play it right."<br/>So, what are the major, common pitfalls that people encounter with it? Where is it easy to tread wrong, and derail the whole play experience? I want to coax out that deep, gut-wrenching play the book talks about, and really hit the core of the games themes. <br/>How do I do that?

I've played twice: Once a session with the scenario from the main book, which crashed in too many ways; another time when we defined humanity, kickers etc and tested out the conflict system, which was fun and memorable, but also showed me unfulfilled potential.

It was the mechanics that my group struggled with, example: <br/><br/><hr/><br/>The trickiest, fiddliest, most headache-inducing thing with the Sorcerer die-mechanics is that your roll for success also becomes your initiative in the round. Now, that sounds simple, on the face of it, but when it meets the bonus/penalty dice mechanic, the complexity increases a LOT. Someone who acts against a bad guy might take an action that successfully penalizes said bad guy by X number of dice.  Since that baddie can't un-roll his dice, they instead transfer to everyone else facing him, as more dice to roll and add into your existing pile.  Sounds nice, but those newly rolled dice then (potentially) change the initiative order for the round you are IN.<br/><br/>So you start off with:<br/><br/>Player1 (attacking baddie2)<br/>Baddie1 (attacking player2)<br/>Baddie2 (attacking player2)<br/>Player2 (attacking baddie2)<br/>Baddie3 (attacking player2)<br/><br/>Player one acts.  Stuff is figured out, and the end result is that Player2 gets two more dice to roll. Player 2 does so, and suddenly initiative changes.<br/><br/>Player1 (attacking baddie2) (DONE)<br/>Baddie1 (attacking player2)<br/>Player2 (attacking baddie2)<br/>Baddie2 (attacking player2)<br/>Baddie3 (attacking player2)<br/><br/>That's some good news for Player2, right?   Now instead of two attacks coming down on him before he can act, he gets defense rolls against everything but one guy.<br/><br/>Still Baddie1 is still going to hit him, and Player one <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">is foolish</span> doesn't want to give up his attack, so he rolls one die...<br/><br/>And it sucks.  He takes a bunch of penalties, so Baddie2 and Baddie3 get four more dice to roll. Now it's...<br/><br/>Player1 (attacking baddie2) (DONE)<br/>Baddie1 (attacking player2) (DONE)<br/>Baddie2 (attacking player2)<br/>Player2 (attacking baddie2)<br/>Baddie3 (attacking player2)<br/><br/>And Baddie3 is actually practically a tie with Player2, so it's likely whatever Baddie 2 does with his move will move the initiative around again.<br/><br/><hr/><br/>You think that's complicated?   That's with TWO PCs and three mooks, AND I DIDN'T INCLUDE DEMONS.  <br/><br/>Try it with four or five PCs (been there), with their demons (done that), and a slightly higher number of mooks (got the t-shirt).  Finally, the conflict mechanics really don't WORK if you ignore the initiative thing.<br/><br/>In short, imagine all the potential game-slow-down of a system where you roll for initiative every round, and add this addendum "After <span style="text-decoration: underline;">every</span> action taken by anyone in the conflict, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">some</span> of the people at the table will probably get a partial reroll of their initiative/success dice that may or may not reorder the remaining actions."<br/><br/>It gets... very very complex.  <br/><br/>The upside is that combat in Sorcerer (conflicts in general) are Nasty, Brutal, and Short; in a round or two, there are usually a LOT fewer people to keep track of.<br/><br/>If you read and followed that example, you can run it.  *I* ran a lot of it, and I'm really not that smart. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75354/#Comment_75354" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T10:04:24+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 10:04AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another common problem is not pushing demon agendas strongly enough.

Even if you recognize it there's a lot of old-hat habit thinking that sort of kicks in and the GM gets tempted to just start ordering things himself.  He might ask the sneaking player to roll Stamina and the two arguing players to roll cover to see if they notice and then have the two arguing characters roll opposing will.  But this wrong.  It's a complex conflict.  Everyone has declared their intentions.  Roll simultaneously and use the rules.  <br/><br/>Specifically<br/><br/>Player 1: Doesn't want anyone to follow the NPCs.<br/>Player 2: Wants to argue his way past Player 1.<br/>Player 3: Wants to sneak past Player 1.<br/><br/>Player 1 and 2 roll Will, Player 3 Rolls Stamina.<br/><br/>There are now a whole BOAT load of possible outcomes.<br/><br/>Now when you employ this on a regular basis you often run up against a very common slightly counter intuitive situation I call, "Defending Against Defense" where someone who is largely in a defensive position comes up first and the second person is in this strange position where he can "abort his action to defend."  What the hell does that mean?<br/><br/>Consider in our example if Player 1 comes up before Player 2 in our complex conflict above.  Player 2 is faced with either defending with a single die, or aborting his action and defending with full Will dice.  But he's in an argument.  How can he abort his argument to continue the argument, so to speak?  You have to realize that even if Player 1 SUCEEDS he can not COMPELL Player 2 to do anything.  Even if Player 1 "wins" the argument Player 2 can still try to forciably brush past Player 1 if he so chooses.  So what's REALLY happening is that Player 1 and Player 2 are jockying for position over one another which will then impact any follow up conflicts.<br/><br/>So consider Player 2's options.  He can either give up on trying to making Player 1 "see reason" and hope to cut the argument short to still give him time to follow the NPCs or he can defend with his one die and take the (most likely) resulting victories of Player 1 as penalties when his action finally does come up in the hopes that he can make his point to Player 1.<br/><br/>And that's powerful story/character stuff.  Is your character the kind of guy who cuts an argument short to take more immediate action or is your character the kind of guy who wishes to give reason and discourse a chance even when it's clear the other side won't see it?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75393/#Comment_75393" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T11:07:17+00:00" title="June 13, 2007 11:07AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Temple</cite>Plus, itd be sorta cool<i>not</i>playing a game wrong for a change.</blockquote>\nA strange concept.

The key thing to remember is that all the rules COMBINE with each other, they don't OVERRIDE each other.  So if a Power says roll the Demon's Power vs. the target's Will that doesn't happen outside any other rolling.  In a complex conflict the Power is what the demon rolls as the "attack/initiative" roll and Will is what the target will be rolling to defend when the Demon's turn comes up.  If the turn Demon's turn comes first the target as the option of aborting and using full Will or just one die as usual.  If the Demon's turn comes later than the target's turn the target just defends will full Will.<br><br>One of my favorite examples is the Shadow ability.  Notice the Shadow ability doesn't really say aything other than color text.  The lighting changes in the environment.  Yeah... and?  So, what if the demon wants to plunge an attacker into darkness to disorient him.  Easy peasy.  Demon rolls Power, attacker rolls Stamina.  Apply initiative/abort rules as usual, any victories the Power roll scores is used as a penalty on whatever the attacker's next action is.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75495/#Comment_75495" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T15:27:11+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  3:27PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I swear I posted to this thread.

I'm the same way, because I want to see how the game works properly or as intended, before tinkering with it to suit my tastes. I want to stick to the recipe as close as possible first, before adding my favourite ingredients to it. <br/><br/>As for Sorcerer, I've only played a few scenes with it once, when Ron was here. And the biggest insight about the game I came away with was... it's plays no different from any "traditional" roleplaying game I know. It might emphasise certain elements more than others, but that's it. All this elaborate and abstract talk about defining humanity, using bangs and driving towards decisions that "say something", etc. is really just there to draw attention to a specific aspect of roleplaying. In other words, Sorcerer is mostly a text that tries to get the reader in the right frame of mind for the game, trying to get the reader to approach the game from a certain angle. But since this is all bungled up with rules that don't really stand out much from the explanatory text, the game seems to be really hard to "play right". Most of the rules are just there to put certain aspects of the game into words. Aspects, which would otherwise remain unspoken and be determined intuitively. <br/><br/>You play Sorcerer "right", once you start caring about your character's struggle with his humanity. Most of the rules serve to outline this struggle for everybody at the table to see.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75741/#Comment_75741" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-14T14:47:45+00:00" title="June 14, 2007  2:47PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/>\n<br/>\nHaven't you realized that JD and I have orchestrated this little dance to occur in each thread as a subtle way to diffuse any potential flameyness by others?<br/>\n<br/>\n"There go JD and Mike again.

Even if you recognize it there's a lot of old-hat habit thinking that sort of kicks in and the GM gets tempted to just start ordering things himself. He might ask the sneaking player to roll Stamina and the two arguing players to roll cover to see if they notice and then have the two arguing characters roll opposing will. But this wrong. It's a complex conflict. Everyone has declared their intentions. Roll simultaneously and use the rules.<br/><br/>Specifically<br/><br/>Player 1: Doesn't want anyone to follow the NPCs.<br/>Player 2: Wants to argue his way past Player 1.<br/>Player 3: Wants to sneak past Player 1.<br/><br/>Player 1 and 2 roll Will, Player 3 Rolls Stamina.<br/><br/>There are now a whole BOAT load of possible outcomes.<br/><br/>Now when you employ this on a regular basis you often run up against a very common slightly counter intuitive situation I call, "Defending Against Defense" where someone who is largely in a defensive position comes up first and the second person is in this strange position where he can "abort his action to defend." What the hell does that mean?<br/><br/>Consider in our example if Player 1 comes up before Player 2 in our complex conflict above. Player 2 is faced with either defending with a single die, or aborting his action and defending with full Will dice. But he's in an argument. How can he abort his argument to continue the argument, so to speak? You have to realize that even if Player 1 SUCEEDS he can not COMPELL Player 2 to do anything. Even if Player 1 "wins" the argument Player 2 can still try to forciably brush past Player 1 if he so chooses. So what's REALLY happening is that Player 1 and Player 2 are jockying for position over one another which will then impact any follow up conflicts.<br/><br/>So consider Player 2's options. He can either give up on trying to making Player 1 "see reason" and hope to cut the argument short to still give him time to follow the NPCs or he can defend with his one die and take the (most likely) resulting victories of Player 1 as penalties when his action finally does come up in the hopes that he can make his point to Player 1.<br/><br/>And that's powerful story/character stuff. Is your character the kind of guy who cuts an argument short to take more immediate action or is your character the kind of guy who wishes to give reason and discourse a chance even when it's clear the other side won't see it?</blockquote>\nI've gone to and fro about whether to post anything here, having been rebuffed from the cliff of Sorcerer several times.  But in the end curiosity wins out....<br/><br/>Jesse, in the example above you seem (to me) to be applying the combat/conflict rules to a social conflict.  I know that a lot of people now say it's a given that Sorcerer really has conflict resolution and this is how it works.  Here's my question:  <b>Do you think that all conflicts in Sorcerer are "extended" conflicts?  Or can there be "quick" conflicts too?</b><br/><br/>That is to say:<br/><br/>"Extended conflicts" : The conflict plays out like a combat with each side rolling to "attack", taking penalties and so on until one side is forced to throw in the towel.<br/>"Quick conflicts" : You roll once to determine the outcome of the conflict.  The winner gets his intent, the next highest roller gets any of his intent that does not conflict the winner's and so on down the chain.<br/><br/>On the few occasions I've played Sorcerer I've seen <i>most</i> conflicts handled in the "quick" style, with only major confrontations using the "extended" rules.  (I'm using all these scare quotes because, of course, the text makes no use of these terms, and I'm really borrowing the concept from games such as HeroQuest, TSoY etc.)<br/><br/>So ...<br/><br/>1) Are "quick" contests "wrong"?  ie are they something that I/other players have just made up and applied erroneously to the Sorcerer text?<br/>2) If you use a lot of "extended" conflicts, how do you rule on how quickly the penalties disappear?  IIRC, even the combat rules are a little vague on recovery times.  But do you let non-physical extended conflicts cause lasting penalties or just have those penalties evaporate at the end of the scene?<br/><br/>Note:  If you are not Jesse, please still feel free to answer these questions.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>R.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75851">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75851/#Comment_75851" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T07:55:56+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  7:55AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick contests are fine, and a normal part of play. Not sure how you'd see it otherwise. I don't use many extended contests when I play. The choice of which to use should be totally what you're comfortable with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for when penalties disappear... think less in dramatic terms than "balance" ones. That is, is it still fun to consider the ramifications of the penalty? Then keep it. Has the dramatic period in which it's interesting passed (perhaps because it's implausible for it to stay, but for any reason)? Then it's gone. Here's a little trick. If you're not sure if it's still interesting, ask the player if he wants to have it still be in effect.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat you shouldn't worry about is trying to find the precise time when it goes away. Just check evern time you roll to see if they're still there.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75862/#Comment_75862" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T08:14:20+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  8:14AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Bret, don't <em>do</em> it.

Or can there be "quick" conflicts too?</b><br/></blockquote>\nYou should check out this thread here: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21236.0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21236.0</a><br><br>Don't think of them as "quick" vs. "extended" that's not the deciding factor.  The deciding factor is whether or not what's called an Orthogonal conflict is present (Note: This term does not appear in ANY Sorcerer text and is a relatively newly articulated concept).<br><br/>This is another non-intuitive thing about Sorcerer's rules.  I use the complex conflict resolution system because of PLayer 3's actions.  If it were JUST Player 1 and Player 2 having an argument I'd use the simpler resolution of just rolling Will vs. Will and be done with it.<br/><br/>Definitions:<br/><br/>Oppositional Conflict: A character is trying to achieve something and simply meeting direct resistance to that goal.  In this case just use the simple conflict resolution.  With just two characters in an oppositional conflict there are only two possible outcomes.  The "agressive" character gets what he wants or he doesn't.<br/><br/>Orthogonal Conflict: A character is trying to achieve something while another character is trying to achieve something else which interfer with or complicate each other.  With just two characters in an orthogonal conflict there are four possible outcomes.  Both characters get what they want, neither character gets what they want, the first character succeeds and the second fails, or the first character fails and the second succeeds.<br/><br/>In Sorcerer the presence of a single Orthogonal Conflict makes ALL conflicts occuring at that time Orthogonal. <br/><br/>I'll reiterate my example from the thread I posted.<br/><br/>Amy wants to grab the vase and Bob wants to stop her.  Oppositional conflict use the simple resolution.  Two outcomes, either Amy gets the vase or she doesn't.<br/><br/>Amy wants to grab the vase, Bob wants to stop her, and Charles wants to shoot Amy.  Charles's action introduces an Orthogonal conflict, use the complex conflict resolution FOR THE WHOLE SITUATION.  What this does is effectively puts Amy and Bob's Oppositional conflict into slow motion where they will stumble and bumble back and forth over the vase while we wait to see what role Charles's gun shot is going to play in the whole thing.<br/><br/>Note: In all of my examples there has been an element of physical danger but this applies to 100% social conflicts as well.<br/><br/>Amy wants to convince Bob to marry her.  Oppositional conflict use simple resolution.<br/><br/>Amy wants to convince Bob to marry her and Charles wants to convince Amy to leave Bob for him.  Orthogonal conflict use complex resolution.<br/><br/>Further Note: You don't need more than two people for an orthogonal conflict.  I've been using three to show how an oppositional conflict inside an orthogonal one gets treated as an orthogonal conflict.<br/><br/>Amy wants to convince Bob to marry her, Bob wants to convince Amy that he's really in love with Mary.  Orthogonal conflict use complex resolution.<br/><br/>Does this help?<br/><br/>Jesse<br/><br/>Edited Note: I NEVER EVER use the "damage" rules for Social Conflict.  Social Conflicts always result in victories which get carried over to a follow up conflict.<br/><br/>Edited Edited Note: Don't worry about dog piling me.  I have spent YEARS studying this game.  Being able to answer questions makes me feel better about that. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers" title="James Jeffers"><img alt="James Jeffers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James%20Jeffers">James Jeffers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75974/#Comment_75974" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T13:38:08+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  1:38PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul has a good idea.
