We were six players in total which slowed the game down at first, but kept the game very lively overall. Some rules were still a little shaky. Such as who has to wager reputation and under which circumstances you get to roll dice. We sort of fought our way through that part and by the end of the first event five of the six characters were roached. We skipped some events and when we got to the Gamma Gamma Gamma Christmas Ball only two players were still roached, while the others tried their best to avoid any scenes, which would cause them to lose Reputation. This is of course a little silly, because it was obvious who at the table was still having fun and who was quietly biding their time waiting to win. I could imagine this a rite of passage for people new to the game. While the game was very loud and funny, it made me realize something about games that provide unlimited narration rights.<br/><br/><b>Without constraints, you need restraint. </b><br/><br/>This is something I've noticed time and again when people are first confronted with games that give them unfettered narration rights. (It's the same with Improv actually.) People tend to go for the obvious, the impossibly broad strokes, the cartoonish and downright ludicrous. This can carry a game for an hour or two (depending on the group's energy), but after that things seem to fall apart with the group aimlessly trading references back and forth and wondering if this is all that the game is good for. <br/><br/>One of the players called it a 'trashy but fun game' afterwards, which I felt wasn't necessarily wrong but kind of backwards. It seemed obvious to me that most of the 'trashy style' was the result of well... 'trashy narration'. That in order to have comedy games (like InSpectres, Paranoia or the Roach) deliver humour that is a closer to what the players appreciate, they need to step up and deliver as well. That means filtering one's own narration since there is no GM and no rules complex to filter out the more outrageous bits of narration. Even relying on group objection to reign individual players in, is only a substitute for restraining one's self for the good of the game. <br/><br/>At least with Paranoia and Roach there are enough elements in place to give the game a humorous twist. There is no need to play funny in order to be funny.<br/><br/>I also noticed that Murab is a curiously awkward card. In both games I played the player drawing Murab saw the chance for some funny Pepe le Pew style sex-jokes and threw him-/herself into the narration with gusto. When the dice were finally rolled and the character playing Murub won the conflict instead of missing out through some amusing contrivance, the scene took on an uncomfortable and hard to ignore subtext. It essentially boiled down to rape, with everybody at the table going 'ewwww' and wondering how the game suddenly ended up there, before quickly moving on and forgetting about this creepy little detour. To be honest, I found the confused awkwardness highly amusing but I do wonder, if this has happened at other games as well. <br/><br/>Going on from there, I noticed that some players framed their scenes and conflicts around their cards. Is that very common? I prefer to use cards as additional layers to the scene itself. With the conflict always about how characters attempt to gain reputation and the cards aiding or hindering. I'm not quite sure if it leads to a notable difference in gameplay or if it's just a stylistic choice.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96912/#Comment_96912" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T10:51:03+00:00" title="September 17, 2007 10:51AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agh, my post got eaten.  <br/><br/>Gonzo narration is really common at first in this sort of unconstrained narrative game.  <i>Universalis </i>has some nice warnings and suggestions about this.<br/><br/>Murub is a dark mirror to your soul.  It's easy to frame narration that does not involve anything horrible.  <br/><br/>It's common for cards to inspire scenes directly.  Often one person will be wildly inspired by their card, lead off with a scene, and things cascade from there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96951/#Comment_96951" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T13:22:56+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  1:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to play a game of Roach now, where the group theme was romantic and secretive.
