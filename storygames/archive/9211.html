So a small note about that in the rules could really help (I haven't looked over the latest version of the rules yet).<br/><br/>Everyone was pretty excited about the genre tropes in this game. I pitched it as "Steampunk meets Firefly and old school Star Wars." And I brought some color copies of cool steampunk tech I found on the net to give us some ideas.<br/><br/>Since we had only three players, I let them pick their characters. Robert picked the goblin pilot of the Owl, Snargle; Chris P. picked Lady Blackbird's bodyguard Naomi Bishop; and Chris W. picked the first mate and mechanic of the Owl, Kale Arkam.<br/><br/>This meant that both of the main characters were NPCs being played by me. And since I didn't want to take spotlight away from the PC's, these two stayed pretty much in the background for most of the game. And since the characters are pretty tied together (especially Lady Blackbird, Cyrus Vance and Naomi Bishop), the game didn't sing as much as it could of.<br/><br/>Scenes:<br/>-The group escaped from a jail cell as the goblin shapeshifter was able to squeeze out of a hole in the jail cell wall. He was able to pick the lock using Kale's awesome detachable mechanical finger. Then they were confronted by several clockwork stormtroopers, but the brute Naomi made short work of them.<br/>-Once they got into the main part of the Hand of Sorrow, they found that it was a lattice-work of elevated train tracks with automated trains running in different directions. They knew they had to find some fuel for the Owl, so Kale and Snargle tried to get up high to look down at the different trains. Kale was able to fly up successfully, but Snargle tripped and fell down some stairs, attracting the attention of more clockwork guards. There was a tough spot for Robert when he wanted to escape from the new clockworks, but I ruled that since he failed his roll and fell down he had the "Angry" condition and would refuse to surrender. So he was forced to fight it out. Which made for some fun, but I think in retrospect I didn't make good use of the conditions there.<br/>-There was a gun battle of primitive laser rifles and black powder pistols as the group found a suitable train and was trying to make off with it. The players were missing quite a few rolls which kept putting them "two steps forward, one step back".<br/>-As we were nearing the end of the 3 1/2 hour session, they made it back to the Owl with the traincar full of fuel and were able to cut the ropes that were holding their ship to a long causeway sticking out the side of the Hand of Sorrow. And they made their quick getaway!<br/><br/>Play Notes:<br/>1. The game was a little hard with only three players and not as many opportunities for helping dice. It was tough for them to bring more than a trait and 1-2 tags into each roll.<br/>2. The session was pretty one-sided because it was all action from start to finish. I had expected a running gunbattle to get to their ship, but honestly I didn't think the escape would take the entire game session. But it seemed like when the three of them would roll for their actions, 1 or 2 of them would fail, which meant I needed to add some sort of complication, which slowed down the action. I think I got better at handling this in the second session of the game, but pacing the game was challenging for me.<br/>3. Little weird having Cyrus and Lady B as NPCs. They stayed in the background and were mostly window-dressing for the session. Which meant that some of the PCs were not hitting their Keys as much as a result.<br/>4. We had talked about having the NPCs try to "drive" what the PCs did by using a mechanic similar to a "compell" in SotC. Might be interesting to consider.<br/><br/>Player Thoughts:<br/>1. Everyone really liked the theme of the game.<br/>2. We liked the magic component, but it was challenging that you could only use one spell tag at once. Which means that it is actually more difficult to accomplish something using magic rather that with a more "normal" trait. Which seems a little counter-intuitive.<br/>3. It would be cool to have magic tags like "powerful" or "far-reaching".<br/>4. Someone had suggested being able to "push" a magic spell with an extra die, but there's more of a risk. I'm not sure the magic system is worth adding a new rules to the game. But perhaps the "push" might work for any conflict. Something to consider.<br/><br/>Overall I walked into the game excited by the subject matter and the thin rules, but tired from a long week. And we had a good session, but the edge could have been sharper.<br/><br/>I think John did an amazing job with these first versions of the game, and it something I'm already excited about modding with different subject matter.<br/><br/>I'll post notes from our second session soon so folks can compare and contrast.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203783/#Comment_203783" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T01:28:17+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  1:28AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2009 1:50AM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caesar_X is being totally reserved in his reporting. You'd think he was a Graham-Brit or something. <br/><br/>The first session was goofy-awesome, and the second session was goofy-awesome cubed.  <br/><br/>Starting off escaping from the escape from the Hand of Sorrow-<br/>Kale manages to scrounge parts from the whole crew to build a device that replicated Space-squid songs of distress, using a gramaphone, some engine cones, LB's romantic candles to make wax cylinder recordngs, and apparently everything of Snargle's except for his hammock!!! Naturally, this succeeded, and led to a space-squid swarm blocking off the HoS's pursuit of our free-trader vessel!<br/><br/>Further souping up of the engines by Kale (and a bit of always excellent daredevil piloting by Snargle) got us to Nightport ahead of schedule (but a bit down on fuel). Time to pop surface-side and make friends!<br/><br/>Cyrus intimiadated our contact (Oskar Bell) on the pirate planet and totally walked out on gangster-debts after getting the scoop on Uriah. Naomi used a small street urchin as a projectile weapon during a kidnapping attempt on LB, orchestrated by a pleasure clockwerk named Fabio.  Much hilarity ensued, as did electro-rapier fencing. Back on the Owl, Lady Blackbird was busy developing the Key of the Heartbreaker, bad, and it was painful to see.  Who woulda thought a tough-guy like Cap'n Vance cooulda been made such a sap for a skirt?<br/><br/>Heading out to a big rock in the Remnants, we were completely bush-whacked by sneaky-ass cloaking-device using pirates.Cap'n Vance chatted 'em up nice, and got pirate admiral to come over for tea. LB's tatas helped set the tone of things, and Mr. Velvet-wearin' Pirate Guy was totally taken in.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kale and Snargle nicked the pirate space-skiff and completely BS'ed their way into stealing a pirate ship's cloaking device and more fuel, plus a couple of Mutiny Pistols. Back on The Owl, the kids fed Cap'n Velvety Pants R+R's  ( Rohipinal and Red Bull) until he was completely co-operative.<br/><br/>Also, far too many jokes about goblin pron. And a talking mouse, Vlad Withersbottom, nicked from the pirates. Finally, Snargle has a pal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203828/#Comment_203828" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T09:58:39+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  9:58AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 28, 2009 9:59AM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A repost of the cliff notes from the first session in the LB PDF thread:<br/><br/>____________________<br/><br/>Cliff Notes:<br/>PCs:<br/>Snargle (me), A gnomelike creature in old-school sailor suit<br/>Kale (Chris W-The New Guy) a thief and clockwork expert from a swiss family <br/>Naomi (Chris P) a Samoan bodyguard ( a bit like a cave-woman, actually) secretly in love with her charge, Lady Blackbird<br/><br/>NPCs:<br/>Vance: A Han Solo Type with a fake eyepatch<br/>Lady Blackbird: A cheddar knight disquised as a peasant<br/><br/>The crew starts in the Brig, which is an enormous metal cage with an equally gimormous combination lock, like something from a steamtech bank vault. We know the Owl is tethered outside, and that we are somewhere down in the lowest part of the Hand of Sorrow, below the rewinding facilities for the clockwork stormtroopers. we can hear some clanking around on watch outside our cell.<br/><br/>The initial breakout:<br/>Snargle gets all chaos-warp shifty and goes "form of...a snake!" and squeezes throught the tiny opening in the cell, with Naomi pushing his bottom side from within the cell. The effect is something like using a pastry bag. In any case, Snargle pops out on the other side. Now what? Seconds to go before the clockwork guards notice!<br/><br/>Kale's player starts decribing her semi-detachable index finger, which is also a sort of safe-cracker/lockpicker leatherman tool. Semi-detachable, because it's held in place to her hand by an extremely thin ( spider web sized), but nigh unbreakable, chord made from the whiskers of space walruses.<br/><br/>( This was about the point that the rest of us realized that Chris W was a ntatural at this sort of thing, despite his protests that he wasn't _really_ a gamer).<br/><br/>Anyway, the finger gets passed to Snargle, having been programmed to open the lock, based on a back and forth convo between Kale and Snargle, describing the mechanism.<br/><br/>Just as the mechanism is releasing, the clockworks show up. Snargle attempts to trip them with the finger as a trip line ( still attached to Kale in the cell, but botches it. Clockworks proceed to pummel snargle with rifle butts. At least it wasn't a pistol-whipping for a change! ( In joke. Never mind)<br/><br/>Naomi uses her neanderthal-like strength to force the cell doors open faster, then jumps out and squishes the clockworks quite thoroughly with her bare hands. Like, seriously, flattens their heads together like a sammich.<br/><br/>A quick rest and recovery, and then the crew is off into the bowels of the ship to try to secure some fuel. This then involves the hijacking of an internal supply train, multiple failed magic-use rolls by Kale, and multiple failed moving manuever rolls by Snargle, with more pummelings involved. Also, an attempt to surrender by a surrounded wounded, trapped, angry Snargle, which fails, so he whips up on his would be captors instead, aided by a quick rescue by Naomi and Kale.<br/><br/>Finally, we seize the train, smash through the doors to the gangplank/cargoplatform where the Owl is located, shoot and run over clockworks in the process, and shoot our way away from the Hand of Sorrow. Pwew-pwew-pwew, crash, crash, crash--WooHaaa!!!!<br/><br/>Um, then I get the real-world afternoon, post-lunch sleepies. We do quick refreshment seens tha are vague to me ( well except for Chris P's "Naomi gives Lady Blackbird a massage" refreshment scene) and we call it a day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203856/#Comment_203856" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T12:19:39+00:00" title="April 28, 2009 12:19PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>Player Thoughts:<br/>1.

Thanks for playing, and especially for such a thorough AP. You guys rock!<br/><br/>I'm gonna address some things from your AP. I'm not really talking to you guys, though. I know you get it and have figured out a bunch of stuff from playing. You don't need me to tell you what's what. But for other people who haven't played yet, I'll expose some of my thinking behind bits of the game and explain some things.<br/><br/>Here we go:<br/><br/>In our games, most PCs are rolling 6 dice or so for the things they're good at. Like, when Kale does thiefy stuff it's usually: 1 + Burglar + Quiet + Sneak + Dextrous + Perceptive = 6. And also maybe Locks or Traps on top of that... maybe Darkness, too. So that's 6-8 dice or so without using their Pool.<br/><br/>If they're rolling 3-4 dice, they're doing stuff they're not great at, so they'll have a tough time of it unless they use their Pool dice. Pool dice are like "hero dice." They let you do basically anything once if you really care about it. If you blow out your pool, you have to hit your Keys real hard and also probably suck up failure to rebuild your dice.<br/><br/>The thing about failure, though, is this:<br/>"If you don\u2019t pass, you don\u2019t yet achieve your goal. [...] The GM will escalate the situation in some way and you might be able to try again."<br/><br/>So when you don't pass an obstacle, the situation gets more dangerous in some way, but not necessarily more complicated. And you'll have to take some action again if you still want that goal, which might mean a new obstacle (and roll), but it might not. Of course, this is my interpretation, which is not in the text.<br/><br/>But my general advice for a game this lightweight is: do what makes you happy, not what you think the game is telling you to do. If adding another hurdle will mess with the pacing, don't add a hurdle! Just escalate. Like, say they try to pull The Owl free from the docking clamps on the Hand and they fail! Crap! The clamps tear holes in the side of the ship and steam and fuel go spewing everywhere! Mark conditions on The Owl. They didn't achieve their goal, things are more dangerous, The Owl is all torn up -- but the way is clear for them to move on to the next thing. The failed roll doesn't mean they're "stuck" at the point of The Owl still being locked up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_204302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moleculo" title="moleculo"><img alt="moleculo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/874/n4G37MA34HKP8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moleculo">moleculo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/204302/#Comment_204302" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-29T21:02:09+00:00" title="April 29, 2009  9:02PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>But my general advice for a game this lightweight is: do what makes you happy, not what you think the game is telling you to do.
