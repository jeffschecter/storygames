You can find them here in some thread or just ask and I'll repost them all.<br/><br/>For me, I plan to play as soon as I can. The RBH is still my favorite game since I found it last year and I want to see it published. And, if possible, translated in french too.

The project isn't dead, just floating in limbo right now.  I haven't had many opportunities to actually play any RPGs at all this summer.  Without the inspiration of actual play, I find it hard to find the motivation to do any design work.</p>\n<p>I have been thinking about RBH on and off all summer though.  I know I really want to adjust the 'tactics' of the thing.  I want them to be a little softer.  The arenas and powers and combat actions should guide and color combats.  The restrictions those rules provide should, ideally, be very soft and subtle.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm back into a game group for the fall at least.  More play = more inspiration = more RBH.  Thanks for the continued support!</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175728/#Comment_175728" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-21T18:04:44+00:00" title="October 21, 2008  6:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric Provost</cite>The project isn't dead,</blockquote>\n\\o/                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175742/#Comment_175742" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-21T21:29:34+00:00" title="October 21, 2008  9:29PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!<br/><br/>I've been wondering about this too. <br/><br/>Good luck, Eric!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh" title="jdrakeh"><img alt="jdrakeh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/909/nZA3BEK4G6OHW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdrakeh">jdrakeh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175799/#Comment_175799" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T11:06:09+00:00" title="October 22, 2008 11:06AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the update, Eric!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175818">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175818/#Comment_175818" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T13:11:10+00:00" title="October 22, 2008  1:11PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been trying out other systems (Microlite20, Tunnel Quest, D&amp;D 4e, Instant Game) on my players but we're gonna try out Kelvin Green's mint little scenario hidden amongst the comments on the RBH homepage in preparation for the 3rd Ed.

Could it be something like : "I am covered by the bushes and walking realy quietly. To spot me and enter my zone, the monster must test Alertness against my Sneakiness" ?<br/><br/>This last way of doing things (attribute vs attribute) seems great to me because it could make more use of Sneakiness, Size or even any other stat given some creativity, but maybe I am overlooking some lame aspect of doing that.<br/><br/>Also, a thing I wanted to test was to accept things like players using their combat action to describe how they could change the nature of the arena into another one. It seems to fit the flair you want to give to combats. For ex, rolling Size to turn over the furniture and change the arena into a Hazardous one. Maybe, just using an action and describing something the group agrees to is good enough to do that without any attribute roll. What do you think ?<br/><br/>By the way, how do you prefer to receive your playtesting data : here, in your blog comments, by email... ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175863/#Comment_175863" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-22T18:21:07+00:00" title="October 22, 2008  6:21PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p><strong><em>How do you imagine the difficulty to "enter" any given zone is set...?</em></strong></p>\n<p>I'm not sure yet.  That's why it's taken me this long to mention the rule.  We've played it a couple different ways, and none of them felt exactly right.  I just know we all enjoyed the idea of hard-to-enter arenas.  Maybe the Arena should be given a stat?  Like, if the Arena were Sneaky +1, then any player or monster who wanted to find a way in would have to roll their Alertness vs. the Sneakiness of the Arena.</p>\n<p>I probably wouldn't use character vs. character rolls for that.  If a really sneaky character wanted to try to hide from a blind monster, I'd let them try that in <em>any</em> arena.
