I really loved it, and so did a lot of other people! There's also this really fun and versatile game called Apocalypse World that is highly adaptable to other genres. A bunch of people have seen that game and wanted to play Mass Effect with it. And so they made hacks! There are no less than three other Mass Effect Hacks I've seen. Problem was, I don't like any of 'em. They don't do what I want them to do, and they don't seem to make the most of the framework and potential inherent in the Apocalypse World system.<br/>I wasn't the only one who didn't like the existing hacks. JasonT made the thread above to start the process of building his own, and I helped pitch into the discussion a bit. Much later, he released what he'd come up with, and I personally still wasn't satisfied. So I thought, well, I have this pile of ideas I advocated for, and if the best way to get things the way I want is to make it myself, I should just do that!<br/><br/>And so I did.<br/><br/>This is the product of that experimentation. I've wrung the Mass Effect name off of the mechanics, though various elements are very obviously inspired by it. In general, The Shining Void is a science fiction hack of Apocalypse World meant to capture the action-packed lives of a crew of competent people aboard a starship, inspired by parts of Star Wars, Star Trek, Firefly, Farscape, and  of course Mass Effect.<br/><br/>I'm very excited to finally present The Shining Void Version 0.1!<br/><a href="http://bit.ly/TheShiningVoid" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE TO GO DIRECTLY TO THE FILE DOWNLOAD</a><br/><a href="http://bit.ly/ShiningVoid01Folder" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FILES INDIVIDUALLY</a><br/><a href="http://the-logbook-project.blogspot.com/2014/06/the-shining-void-release-version-01.html" rel="nofollow">CLICK HERE TO VIEW THE RELEASE ON MY BLOG AND SEE THE DESIGN HISTORY AND CONTEXT OF THE GAME</a><br/><br/>What this game needs now is playtesting to see if things even work. However, any feedback from just reading through it would really help.

I had a read through, very cool.  Looks mighty good for a v0.1!  No playtest, but I've got some thoughts from the read.<br/><br/>The species flavor text is very ME specific, for example the short lived Scientist doesn't describe a Vulcan very closely.  Is that something you're interested in covering in the flavour text?<br/><br/>Some layout and proofreading points:<br/>The species sheet lists the Savage too many times.  Also I saw a reference to Loyalty under the Straightforward move, which is presumably now Trust?<br/>The grey bars down the left of the playbooks doesn't look printer ink/toner friendly. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'm not sure about the Trust mechanic, but it's something I'd have to see in play.  For example, I guess on the give orders move, if a PC does what you say, that means they trust you in the fiction.  While that does make some sort of sense, overall it does seem a bit restrictive, in that you can't decide yourself whether you trust someone or not.<br/><br/>Are you sure about the stat spread?  Averaging out to +1 doesn't feel very high for hypercompetent badasses.  Maybe a base -1, 0, +1, +1 start?  Or give two +1 bonuses to different stats?<br/><br/>I'd also have to see Biotics and purely narrative harm in play.  For an action game, I wonder if they would benefit from more codification.  AW Dark Age apparently has a new system where you start with positive statements, like "I'll live a long healthy life." that you check off.  Maybe you can only cheat death so many times?  At least before you get rebuilt by an Agency, or something.<br/><br/>All that aside, it does look playtestable.  I don't know if I'll get a chance soon, but it does look interesting, and your earlier thread got me to buy ME3 in the recent Origin sale...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa" title="Tulpa"><img alt="Tulpa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tulpa">Tulpa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434120/#Comment_434120" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-20T22:46:12+00:00" title="June 20, 2014 10:46PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            'biotic' still feels very setting specific but otherwise I am excited to playtest this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434123/#Comment_434123" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-20T23:47:55+00:00" title="June 20, 2014 11:47PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm still trying to work out just how far I want the flavor text to reflect Mass Effect. The most crucial element is "Bioware and EA can't send me C&amp;D notices," and beyond that I haven't quite decided how far I want to go. On the one hand, channeling the ME races, if not entirely, let's me focus on some of the bits I really like from them, but more versatility might not be a bad thing.<br/><br/>Wow, yeah, I changed everything but the NAME. That's, um, crucial O_O.<br/>You're right, Loyalty means Trust. Thanks for catching that.<br/>They're not. They're just temporary placeholders, but I guess just a rectangle frame would probably do <img alt=":/" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":/"/> Might axe them when I fix up those other proofreading gaffs.<br/><br/>I'm right there with you regarding Trust. It's the weakest point of the game, and has been the hardest thing to really get to feel how I want it.<br/>To try and deal with your example, here's how I would interpret it. At any point, you might supposedly trust them. That's fine, but what having it on the sheet (such as after accepting Orders) means is that it's verified. Your Trust in them isn't just in your head, it's a thing people can rely on. I'm not sure if that plays out in the rules yet, but that's where my mind is at about it. Playtesting will hopefully help this system in particular.<br/><br/>I'm okay with the spread for now - it's taken straight from the MH stat setup, but it might be preferable to go with -1/0/+1/+1. I want to see how it goes with these numbers first though.<br/><br/>Codification might help. I think narrative harm CAN work in an action game to a degree, but it might help to do something I guess. Like you said, seeing it in action will guide my thinking a bit better. I suppose now is a good point to mention that I potentially have a plan for when I'll be playtesting: the week after next my Monsterhearts season is ending, so hoepfully I'll be using a couple sessions of Shining Void as the palette cleanser between seasons.<br/><br/>Yup, "biotic" is a word on the probation list! The shift from Mass Effect Hack to The Shining Void came late in the game and I actually only noticed that I'd still been saying biotics the whole time right at the end. If I can come up with a convincing alternative I'll be jumping ship right away.<br/><br/>Thanks for the readthrough and thoughts, both of you! It's exciting to me that people are interested in being able to playtest it themselves. And enjoy ME3 cneph!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434130/#Comment_434130" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-21T05:35:04+00:00" title="June 21, 2014  5:35AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick point re.

Warrior: Honor-bound, Hierarchical and rigid, Militaristic and disciplined...<br/>Scientist: Long lived and patient, short lived and urgent, logical and cold, intuitive and passionate...<br/>Could even be another source of Conflict.<br/><br/>And on Trust- the way you explain it- that I can rely on the verified fact that you trust me- feels maybe like something that should be on _my_ sheet.  That way you can give it to me.  Then I can leverage or betray or lose or build that Trust.  It's a vulnerability (maybe, depending on genre), but also (in the ME game as genre) a necessity for tight-knit teamwork or even survival.

I'll give it a session at current, but I'd be entirely unsurprised to find myself shifting to -1/0/1/1 by the next draft.<br/>(An interestering side effect of -1/-1/1/1 and six rolebooks is that there's one of each combination of stats! That has no relevance on good design, but I thought it was interesting enough to mention)<br/><br/>Doing it that way is a definite possibility! My fear of that method is that I can't draw on some elements for moves if I do so, since I don't want to limit move choice much since it's pretty restricted already. Bears serious consideration though.<br/><br/>You keep hitting all the spots that were already giving me little doubts! I went back and forth on this through development and just made a chlice when I made the sheets - that WILL be one of the early changes since it's easy to change "People I Trust" to "People Who Trust Me."<br/>I'll probably do that tonight, along with changing the Species names off of the Savage. Still can't believe I did that.<br/><br/>Hey, what do you think of Conflict Phrases tied to the moves for XP (or at least as a supplement to XP-on-failure)? It's a variant of what I did with AvW but I'm not sure if it reads like it does in my head.<br/><br/>And seriously, thanks for sharing all these thoughts, it's really helping.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434198/#Comment_434198" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-22T23:20:44+00:00" title="June 22, 2014 11:20PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey folks, updated the Playbooks with the proper names and switching who's Trust is recorded.

Overall, we had a really good time with it, and it felt very Mass Effect-y (playing the soundtrack helped). I loved the narrative focus of the basic moves and the two-part character sheets. It's very polished and playable for a 0.1 beta! Minor wording issues (which will almost definitely be polished in revisions), I only really have one significant piece of feedback.<br/><br/>The fictional trigger for Support Your Team move felt too narrowly defined. There's only so many times the characters can pull aggro and distract the enemy before it starts feeling a bit boring; in practice, it's also pretty similar to the Bold Aggression move, which also involves occupying the opponents' attention (by trying to kill them).\n<blockquote>Support Your Team: When you ignore all other priorities completely occupy the opponents\u2019 attention, roll +Paragon. On a 10 or greater, your team is safe as you take on all the impending danger yourself, and you take +1 to rolls as you continue to distract your enemies from your allies. On a 7, 8, or 9, the next person you\u2019re supporting that makes a move gets +1 to the roll, but you must select one:<br/>* you\u2019re cut off and exposed to the full danger,<br/>* you only bought time, and not much of it,<br/>* they managed to get at your team a bit before you distracted them</blockquote>\n[I think there's also a typo in the move - shouldn't it be "your team takes +1 to rolls as you continue..." rather than just "you?"]<br/><br/>What I felt the Basic Moves were missing was a broader Paragon-based "Support Your Team" move, that might include occupying the enemy's attention, but would also account for situations like rushing into fire to rescue a fallen comrade, or knocking down a pillar to provide cover for a teammate. I'm no game designer, but I would envision it something like this:\n<blockquote>Support Your Team: When you ignore all other priorities <b>and your own safety to aid or protect your comrades</b>, roll +Paragon. On a 10 or greater, your team is safe as you take on all the impending danger yourself, <b>and your allies take +1 to rolls as you continue to support them</b>. On a 7, 8, or 9, the next person you\u2019re supporting that makes a move gets +1 to the roll, but you must select one:<br/>* you\u2019re cut off and exposed to the full danger,<br/>* you only bought time, and not much of it,<br/>* <b>your team is exposed to some smaller part of the danger</b></blockquote>\nAnyway, we're hoping to play again sometime soon.

One small thing I take issue with are a few of the names, specifically "Experienced", especially as you're keeping "XP" - maybe call the stat "Veteran", which makes sense alongside Paragon or Regenade, all three are more of an earned title or description than an attribute.<br/><br/>What I'm not sold on is lumping everything remotely strange into the "Alien" category. As the game is set up right now, it's pretty solid for everyone who wants to play a human space marine with a big gun or a badge. Everyone else is lumped into one stat. I dislike how there's no stat-wise distinction from biotics and multitools, Adepts and Techs, Asari and Salarian. There's also, unless I'm mistaken, no roll for Perception/Read a Situation or Person.<br/><br/>My suggestion would be to re-divide it into Sharp and Weird, or whatever names you go with. Put Multitool and some kind of perception roll on Sharp, and biotics and enact a crazy plan on Weird. I feel like these are not only different enough in-fiction to deserve a second stat, but also, and imho more importantly, the <b>type of characters who would use each stat are distinct.</b> I like the idea of a nerdy tech who doesn't know much about these weird aliens, or an intuitive biotic at home amidst strangeness but who's not what you'd call the sharpest knife in the drawer. It also forces the more straightforward characters to make a more interesting decision about what they're good at other than their specialty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437867/#Comment_437867" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T02:21:00+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  2:21AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, time to show up and pretend I only just noticed the comments!

When I played we had the general sense that the game worked better if you took the triggers a bit loosely, so I wouldn't be surprised if my revision ends up looking quite like that <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/>Thanks for playing!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Riovanes">@Riovanes</a> Thanks for looking at the game in such detail. I agree about having both Experienced and XP, so I'll probably change one of them.<br/>On the other hand, I actually feel pretty confident about Alien. It keeps my mechanics a little simpler to just have four stats instead of five. I do agree that having tech in Alien is a bit odd - I might switch that up into Experienced to split it out, plus I think it's a bit more sensible as well. I haven't looked into how that affects my balance of mechanic-to-stat, but I think I can make that work. It's not a perfect fit to Experienced, but technology does become a lot more usable with practice, especially as compared to the largely talent-determined basic biotic ability. Plus since Experienced doesn't literally imply having been out for a long time, you can play the newbie tech wiz with a high Experienced.<br/>Sharp is something I specifically chose not to include. I find that the source genre isn't really about the things Sharp usually applies to. Based upon my own play though I will be adding some sort of learning-stuff move into the game, though more along the Spout Lore lines than the Discern Realities lines.<br/>Thanks for putting the thought in! It's made me think about some stuff, and you definitely have some good points there.<br/><br/>Thanks to you both for your feedback!<br/><br/>On a personal note, I played a two-session game of The Shining Void several weeks back. It was really fun. Nobody had significant Mass Effect experience and ME wasn't really the mood they reached for, and since I want tSV to be able to do other stuff too it was really interesting to see just how ME-flavored everything still is. The Species are gonna have their descriptions modified more, probably with options, to allow a better customization of types of aliens. Our game was ridiculous and fun. Everything went so much better than I thought it would.<br/><br/>Also, I'm pretty sure that The Shining Void is "Guardians of the Galaxy: the RPG" and that makes me very excited.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437893/#Comment_437893" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-28T14:18:05+00:00" title="August 28, 2014  2:18PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Species options sounds great.

Kinetics is nice though, I just might use that.<br/><br/>Thanks! A specific 'other thing' I wanted to incorporate was actually Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie was pitch-perfect to a session of The Shining Void, and I felt my current system hadn't been flexible enough to accommodate that. I basically felt I needed to slide some ideas around until I could play them. It's still a bit hard to fit Rocket and Groot simultaneously as they're both basically Outsiders, but it can be done if you plan it out.<br/>Interestingly, opening it up to Cultures and having these lists also opens up the ME options a tad - Drell, Hanar, Elcor, Volus, Batarians, and Vorcha are all playable if you choose the right options.<br/><br/>Oooooh "steps" is nice! Really simple, and it's clear what it is. Plus it sounds great in a sentence, "When you... gain a Step." "Every 5 Steps, you may take an Improvement from the list." <br/>I considered changing Experienced, but I really couldn't come up with a synonym that captured exactly the sense of what I wanted it to do.<br/>It actually doesn't bother me that people will SAY xp for it. With it changed, it will never be ambiguous in the text itself which mechanic I'm referring to - especially since I abbreviate Experienced as EXP, a typo can't get in the way now.<br/>Thanks!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441029/#Comment_441029" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-12-24T12:01:55+00:00" title="December 24, 2014 12:01PM">December 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey folks. The new version is in production still, and it's slow going. Just wanted to put a little update in: I think I solved Support Your Team.<br/><br/>SYT needed a rewrite. It was bulky and not actually useful - Help was universally better. For a few minutes I just folded SYT entirely and just renamed Help to SYT, but lacking an exclusive Paragon move wasn't a good idea. Now I have this:<br/><br/>Support Your Team (+Paragon)<br/>When you devote your efforts to aiding an ally\u2019s move, roll +Paragon. If they Trust you, add an additional 2 to your roll. You will share in any consequences of their move unless stated otherwise. On a 10 or greater, add 1 to their roll and choose up to two of the following choices. On a 7, 8, or 9, choose one of the following options.<br/>~ Add an additional 1 to their roll,<br/>~ You take on all the consequences of their move instead of them,<br/>~ You suffer none of the consequences of their move.<br/><br/>It folds in +Paragon, Trust, boosting rolls, distractions, and denying responsibility. It should be obvious that even if you roll 10+ you can't take both the second and third option, and this will be specified later in the text to avoid confusion.

You're right about the first list - I loooooove most of those ideas but they're all seeds for individual game Fronts. I want to play all of them, but not really the sort of generic material for the book. Inspiration list you gave was totally perfect though, almost a perfect match for the list I'm using.<br/><br/>The second post stuff is cool. Definitely material I may be able to use.<br/><br/>I think the real issue is I'm not entirely sure WHAT I'm looking for. I'm not even sure how I want to structure Threats. The absolute simplest mechanism already in PbtA use is, well, the Monsterhearts approach of not having them. The ApW model is my usual go-to: Threat categories with a few subtypes each, an instinct for every subtype and a couple MC moves unique to each overall category. I've been sitting around thinking about it though, and it doesn't feel like a perfect fit to me.<br/>Maybe it's just feeling static since I used the same model over in AvW and I'm looking for something new, but I don't know what I want.<br/><br/>A brief look at existing PbtA threat models:<br/>Apocalypse World: Threat categories and subtypes, category moves and individual instincts.<br/>Monsterhearts: No threat types.<br/>Dungeon World: Threats exploded out into a full bestiary.<br/>Sagas of the Icelanders: If I remember right, also no threat types (which surprises me, maybe I need to read the Sagas book again with a look at how it handles long-form).<br/>Monster of the Week: Its been a while since I looked at it, but I think threats are handled in a more adventure-style way. Procedures for developing the mysteries, but not list-style.<br/><br/>Hmm. Maybe that last one would work. But my general approach is very fond of the list-selection technique for crafting (it allows a lot of designer control over tone AND is flexible and fast to use). Maybe I don't even need a list of threat types so much as lists to help build individual Singularities (aka Fronts). I'd need some consideration of threat type (at the level of place/person/institution), motives, maybe strengths or other properties. Then taking the general properties of the Singularity to fractal inward and create the more specific aspects of it. <br/>If designed on the large-scale instead of individual entities generated as events unfold, it'd be easier to do that unfolding reveals thing.<br/><br/>Okay, so I guess the new question I'm working with is:<br/>What are the important aspects of an antagonist structure overall? What elements need to be added in the transition from talking about it overall to talking about individual aspects of the structure in order to feel both specific and subordinate to the overall Singularity?<br/><br/>(why didn't I write this out, or at least tweet it, over the weekend? putting it in words is way more productive than just letting it stew in my brain)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441422/#Comment_441422" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-13T19:24:29+00:00" title="January 13, 2015  7:24PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Okay, so I guess the new question I'm working with is:<br/>What are the important aspects of an antagonist structure overall?</blockquote>\nMotivations.<br/>Intentions.<br/>Assets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_441448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441448/#Comment_441448" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-14T00:08:58+00:00" title="January 14, 2015 12:08AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Motivations.<br/>Intentions.<br/>Assets.</blockquote>\nYes!

One thing about this genre is that for some Threats, many of the Assets (moves) won't necessaily be 'fair', nor the motivations comprehensible, while the scale can be vast.  Reprogram the ecosystem to some primordial soup.  Crack the crustal plates.  Accelerate the main sequence.  Capture all life forms for processing.  Then you get other threats that think they can understand and control those alien superpowers (Illusive Man or Ozzie(?) style), ascribing their own motivations to utterly alien beings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441747/#Comment_441747" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-20T10:00:03+00:00" title="January 20, 2015 10:00AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Version 0.2 is released!

That's a game I wanna play!  Beliefs and awesome heroic actions, sacrifice, greater causes.  That has to be a move, a thing you do, right?  But it's not, explicitly anyway.<br/><br/>So my feedback/personal hack of Shining Void would include something like this...<br/><br/>When you <b>risk it all</b> for something you believe in despite an imminent threat, roll +all that apply:<br/>- the well-being of someone Loyal (you Trust and Trusts you?) is under severe threat<br/>- you can advance or resolve one of your Conflicts<br/>- something something achieve a mission/objectives/beliefs are at stake<br/>Less one if one of your Conflicts led to this moment.<br/>on a 10+, Awesome!<br/>7-9 hard choices yadda yadda<br/><br/>I dunno, something like that.  Rough draft.<br/><br/>Of course, a couple of problems here: Beliefs aren't in the game, and Objectives are mentioned on the Leader book, and once, lower case, on page 81- they don't seem to be a procedural Thing in this version of the rules.  They probably should be?  I <i>think</i> so.<br/><br/>Also, you might say Enact a Crazy Plan is the generic act under fire move, but sometimes you're just running full pelt towards the edge of the crashing Chrysalis Hunter when a simultaneous exploding platform-leap hurls you towards the ramp of your Minotaur shuttle and you just hope your one of your crew extends an arm for you as you windmill through the burning atmosphere.

That can develop over time as we reveal your story in play and be linked to Steps and gaining Trust, and all that good stuff?  Write it down on the sheet, that's gold, baby.  Probably some provocative questions as prompts would be helpful, but that's more work.<br/><br/>So, cool. Mission and personal objectives. <b>Risk it all</b>.  Now how do I figure out what's going on?  Is that all covered under MC principles?  Is there a reason you don't have a 'read' move?<br/><br/>In my hack of TSV, maybe it's +Experienced, but maybe it's:<br/><br/>When a situation demands <b>heightened alertness</b>, roll +all that apply:<br/>- you have concrete reason to suspect a threat<br/>- there is someone Loyal to you who can clue you in or help out<br/>- you are willing to take some risks to find out, the MC will tell you what.<br/>Less one if your Conflicts might affect your judgement.<br/>On a 10+, ask 3, or instead <i>if you already <b>know</b></i>, just give us the sitrep and yep, that's it, on the surface at least.  <br/>On a 7-9, ask 1, or instead give us your best guess, and you'll be partially right.<br/>- what here has changed from the mission Intel or data banks?<br/>- what is the most immediate threat to Objective __________?<br/>- what's my best next step to achieving Objective __________?<br/>And a couple more options.<br/><br/><br/>What do I mean by 'on the surface, at least'?  Right here, right now, you've nailed the what and when and maybe the who, but you've probably not got the why, and perhaps not the how.  But maybe I should just simply stop hedging player authorial freedom on a 10+.<br/><br/>Of course, none of these roll plus number of things that apply are playtested.  They're meant to give a range from -1 to +3. Each line can only apply once, no matter how many concrete reasons for suspicion you've got.  I like the formulation, but handling time might be an issue in practise, and the balance/ease of accumulating net pluses might need work.<br/><br/>Also both of my moves would have a formulation of 'someone who you Trust and Trusts you'.  Is that defined?  Loyal might be a good term for it.

Not sure if that's the case.<br/><br/>On the subject of personal shields/heroes in blaster-absorbing armour, it's a sometimes thing, not a universal- ME, the Culture, and Dune have those, not (classic) SW, ST, Firefly, etc.  It pretty clearly links to the former media rather than the latter, to my mind.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442108/#Comment_442108" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T10:21:34+00:00" title="January 27, 2015 10:21AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh. Roll +elements that apply is really interesting, I've never thought about working with that! I like it. I'd want to see it in play, but I'm still at the try-things-out stage anyway. For both of them you implemented an element of Conflicts being the negative component. I'm not sure I'd want to set the Conflicts at that negative point; despite the obvious connotations of the word "conflict" they're things I want to show up and be used. Of course, on the other hand any time they cause enough trouble to be a negative impact on a move would be a definite time to take a Step, so maybe that's a balancing point? I dunno. It gives me pause. The whole concept is really intriguing though.<br/><br/>Risk It All is the sort of thing I'd hoped to grab with Enact A Crazy Plan. Heck, that trigger of risk it all might be interesting to play with. It might even just be the name of it. Typically I'd resort to Dig In as the Act Under Fire stand-in, though it's not a perfect parallel.<br/><br/>The idea of bringing the Objective system to the whole table, rather than just the Leader, is something that was brought up before this draft. I didn't change it, but mostly because I hadn't made a decision yet. I hadn't thought of using the introduction personal mission as a component of the character creation itself, and that's a good idea!<br/><br/>Alright, the lack of the "read" move: this <i>was</i> intentional. It's my personal sense of the genre that, in general, investigation of the immediate surroundings and getting a grasp on things isn't the focus of the action. That's something that I believe should just be provided. If there was to be an ambush or other sudden surprising event, it would fall under MC Move territory, and that just looking around and getting a grasp of things should be free and riskless.<br/>That said, my experience with the game in an actual play context has been limited, and within that context the players wound up mentioning that not having it felt weird. However, I'm not sure how much was the game needing one, how much was the players not being used to asking without a move, or me not being used to providing so freely. I've been considering adding one, but I want to try one more playtest without it before I do.<br/><br/>You Trust and Trusts you is certainly doable (especially since you track both on your sheet), but I worry about frequency of occurrence. I don't have much experience within tSV, but Avatar World has a similar set of Respect and Respects you dynamics and I've been surprised at how uncommon mutual Respect is there. Maybe it's a bit different in tSV but those are my instincts.<br/><br/>As for the Veteran, I'd say that I think their moves are, while not less powerful necessarily, they are distinctly less frequently used. Two of the three involve visiting new locations, which doesn't happen as often as action springs up (which is often the triggering element for other Roles), and near-death is also quite rare, especially with Shields +2 (as that would be the part I would keep, rather than the bonus Equipment move). This makes them generally more competent, but the other characters have more frequent opportunities to make use of their unique abilities. Maybe that's balanced, I dunno. Thanks for the detailed thoughts, giving me some ideas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_442111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442111/#Comment_442111" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T10:45:42+00:00" title="January 27, 2015 10:45AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2015 10:47AM by Cneph.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't take credit for +elements, I saw it elsewhere, the crashed ornithopter troupe play thing I think.  Negative component is optional, just to stretch the range and calibrate the net bonus. It might not apply. i.e. play testing required.  More of a stretch in Risk It All, but I think Conflicts absolutely could cloud your judgement.  Trusts and Trusts you could also be calibrated, but not sure which single one I'd pick for a risk it all.  Remember the average bonus elements should probably be +1 or less for a starting character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_442112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/442112/#Comment_442112" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-27T10:59:44+00:00" title="January 27, 2015 10:59AM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2015 11:11AM by Cneph.">edited January 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personal mission isn't just character creation, it's the ME2 loyalty quests.
