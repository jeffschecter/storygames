For example, some systems offer bonuses for describing cool stunts.  Some other systems award experience for things that the players do, such as initiating in-character interactions.  This seems like a reward mismatch to me; it seems like the character should be rewarded for things the character does.  The same goes for the player in my mind.  Linking character advancement to character actions doesn't seem that hard to do.  Linking player rewards to player actions seems tougher.<br/><br/>It seems possible, but I'm having some trouble brainstorming ways to do it, so I'm looking for some suggestions.  What sort of rewards might be offerred to players?  And what sorts of actions could you reward?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96104/#Comment_96104" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T14:46:47+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  2:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Max P</cite>It seems possible, but I'm having some trouble brainstorming ways to do it, so I'm looking for some suggestions.

I know many players who feel rewarded when they get a bonus or experience. Which then leads me to question, why should there be any reward in a game system that isn't Player focussed? The player bought the game, after all. The damn character is just piggybacking on all the player's hard work. I say, reward the player for doing things you want the game to be about and maybe they'll do those things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96122/#Comment_96122" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T15:41:30+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  3:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that a game should be rewarding to the player, certainly.  I'd also agree that most (all?) rewards should be enjoyable to the player.  I'm thinking about the idea that a reward oughta facilitate the thing that is being rewarded.  (It's not an original idea, someone around here said it recently, I just can't think of who.)  Assuming that conjecture to be true for the moment, let's think about experience.  Experience, as the currency of character advancement, improves the character's abilities and helps them do more cool awesome <i>in-game</i> things.  So, by this theory, experience would be awarded for doing those cool awesome in-game things, and facilitates doing more of them.  Hopefully, that will be enjoyable to the players.  A similar line of thought applies to bonuses, in that they facilitate character actions in response to player actions.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are things that the players do that contribute to the game too, on a reasonably independent from characters (i.e. meta-game level.)  This theory would say that those contributions should be rewarded with something that helps the player do them more.  So, if you wanted to reward initiating new scenes, you might award some currency of scene framing power.  If you wanted to encourage party cohesion/goal sharing, you might reward "finding a way to make another character's goal important to your character" with some currency of "introducing suitable rewards into the fiction for another character to share in your goal."<br/><br/>So, to refine the question, what I'm asking is:  What are some (non-character) player actions you'd want to facilitate, and what kind of rewards would you use to do so?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96154">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/markv" title="markv"><img alt="markv" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/markv">markv</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96154/#Comment_96154" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T16:46:39+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  4:46PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            maybe if you wanted to encourage players to switch between different characters and to take on roles that are typically granted to a gm, players could spend rewards for picking characters in upcoming scenes and choosing what managerial/refereeing/gming types role they would play in the next set of scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96180/#Comment_96180" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T19:03:19+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  7:03PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: markv</cite>maybe if you wanted to encourage players to switch between different characters and to take on roles that are typically granted to a gm, players could spend rewards for picking characters in upcoming scenes and choosing what managerial/refereeing/gming types role they would play in the next set of scenes.</blockquote>\nI have thought in the last year or two about a game that does just that, specifically for the comic book supers genre.  _Players_ earn points which they spend to purchase author or editorial or inking rights in the next issue and/or the right to run a specific character.  In the most recent iteration, I linked it to a relationship map, so that the cost to change characters was based on the "distance" from their current character.  (E.g., it would be relatively cheap to shift from Superman one session to Jimmy Olsen the next, but damn near impossible to shift to Swamp Thing.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96209/#Comment_96209" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T22:57:24+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 10:57PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now this is cool!

If they are all player rewards anyway, why not just reward the player wherever you see fit to do whatever you think makes the game cool?

So, following this theory, things that players do on the meta-game level, like scene framing, ought to be rewarded in a way that facilitates doing it more.  So that's where the divide starts:  according to this theory, if you want to reward character actions, the reward should help the character do them more.  If you want to reward player actions, the reward should help the player do them more.<br/><br/>Take D&amp;D.  You get experience for killing things (a character reward), which makes you better at (i.e. facilitates) killing things (a character action.)  Now suppose you want to reward players for, say, initiating scenes.  If you give experience, it ends up making them better at killing things, but doesn't help them initiate interactions.  The reward may actually send them <i>away</i> from setting up conversations and toward killing things.  So maybe there's another reward currency that <i>would</i> encourage initiating conversations.  A similar thing might be said for any player actions independent of their characters.<br/><br/>EDIT: From the system mixing thread -\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valvorik</cite><br/>Dogs/Afraid and Burning Wheel do great job of breaking the connection of "character must succeed at actions" and "character becomes more proficient/player controlling character gains resources to affect play".</blockquote>\nIn a certain sense, this is the connection I'm trying to break.

The players who like being in-character keep getting more awesome at that stuff, but get no resources to help them frame scenes.<br/><br/>I think it works better when its "If you want awesome character stuff, you gotta frame scenes" and "if you want to frame scenes, you better go and do some awesome character stuff."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96688/#Comment_96688" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T19:25:04+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  7:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>I think it works better when its "If you want awesome character stuff, you gotta frame scenes" and "if you want to frame scenes, you better go and do some awesome character stuff."</blockquote>You mean, like "If you take player action (framing a scene) then you get character resources" and "If you take character action (doing awesome character stuff) then you get player resources"?<br/><br/>Yeah.

Accomplishing things in character, or practicing them, won't lead to improvement at related skills, but framing scenes will.  This just doesn't work out.  Players who prefer the in-character stuff won't be receiving rewards they value, <i>and</i> neither will the scene framers.  No one ends up encouraged.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the problem of the players who are already good at a particular player task and get more resources for doing it, resulting in game domination is a concern.  I think there are ways to work with this.  One way would be to offer resources that enable framing "cooler" scenes rather than more scenes.  Of course, you'd have to deal with this on a per issue basis, as the same solution won't work for every player task.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
