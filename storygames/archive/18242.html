It's not always the same participant but it seems like there is always someone who gets a passive character. So far, according to my perception, there are four kinds of situations that creates this.<br/><br/>- The character perhaps only exist in a game to support another character. If that's the participant's intention then it's OK.<br/>- The character is a token that's moved around by other characters. If that's the participant's intention then it's OK.<br/>- The player doesn't know where the character is heading in the story. If that's the case then it's NOT OK.<br/>- The character doesn't have any relations to the other characters. If that's the case then it's NOT OK.<br/><br/>All four could be typical examples of when inspiration is lacking for the participant, which forces the participant to take a passive role. One way of solving this is to have structures to establish the characters. I would like to see a collaborate storytelling game that let the participants answer the following questions.<br/><br/>\xd7 Who am I?<br/>\xd7 What do I want?<br/>\xd7 How should I achieve that?<br/><br/>It's important that everybody around the table gets this information about the character. There should not be any secrets between the participants! You need perfect information so that you can frame scenes with the other characters in mind or change your own characters goal to either interrupt or adapt to the other characters. The last question is nothing more than foreshadowing. Note that I say no secrets between the participants and not the characters. The questions can be revealed in any order and how they are revealed during the session could differ. The players could talk about it in OOC rounds, they can reveal it while playing out the first scenes or it's information that comes forth during a common preparation. Perhaps by creating a relationship map together.<br/><br/>But these questions doesn't automatically create an active role for the participant. Lets say that one participant creates an antisocial person that wants to be alone by living in a cave. That's a truly passive role and could be hard to draw in or create a story around. So there must be a fourth question, which would be:<br/><br/>\xd7 Why now? (or) Why should we give a shit?<br/><br/>This is the question that ties all the others together. But before they answer any questions, the groups should also agree of a starting place, situation or both. You could play as many different stories as characters, like in <b>Polaris</b>, but even if that game has spotlight moments, it can still create passive roles. The game itself leaves things hanging and gives no real pointers of how to create an active player. A player should <i>act</i> and not react in a collaborate storytelling game.<br/><br/>What I need help with is that some of my thoughts have come to a stop and I need help sorting them out.\n<ul><li>Can a scenario only consist of active roles or does it need passive roles as well?</li>\n<li>Is is anything in the above that can be removed or mixed together?</li>\n<li>What collaborate storytelling games have it hard coded in their structure that you must establish these essential things about a character before you can move on?

What is the character about, what do they want? I sometimes get frustrated at the lack of this feature in Apocalypse World (or its hacks, like Monsterhearts), and feel tempted to build it in.<br/><br/>Some positive examples of games which do this well:<br/><br/>* Burning Wheel<br/>* In a Wicked Age...<br/>* Sorcerer<br/>* Fiasco (sometimes)<br/><br/>In my own game <i>Land of Nodd</i>, character creation consists entirely of answering these questions:<br/><br/>1. What do I want more than anything at this point in my life/story? (The Desire)<br/>2. Why can't I have it - what stands in my way? (The Obstacle)<br/>3. Why is <i>now</i> the time to take action - why must I act on this <i>now</i>? (The Kicker)<br/><br/>Then you're ready to start playing.<br/><br/>Another interesting example is The Shadow of Yesterday/Solar System (and all its successors, like Lady Blackbird). Keys are built in such a way that they can very easily express character motivation directly (and work really well for that purpose). However, they can also be used in a way which only highlights certain features which are not character drivers (for example, a Key which gives you XP when you do something clumsy or make others laugh). <br/><br/>Eero (the author of Solar System) often says that he considers this an important feature of the game: this way you can have important protagonists playing alongside "bit characters", like the hero and his comic relief sidekick, and both players get what they want - one gets to play the protagonist who drives the story, and the other gets to participate from the sidelines without too much responsibility when it comes to the direction of the story.<br/><br/>In any case, I believe that dealing with the issue of primary character motivation is one of the most important questions for a game designer to answer. (Although clearly some designers feel otherwise, or, at least, are happy to leave this part up to the group playing without any explicit direction.)<br/><br/>Asking whether every character MUST have this kind of story motivation, and, if not, what kind of balance is important, is a very interesting question!<br/><br/>One of the problems that RPGs face is that most of our favourite stories feature a singular protagonist, but we like to have a multitude of them. This is not an obvious problem to solve, and well worth considering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411504/#Comment_411504" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-07T10:49:17+00:00" title="April  7, 2013 10:49AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            PTA handles this by having people create characters that exist in the show first, THEN letting them pick which character in the show they will play.

My solution there was to recognize that a traditional movie-like story only requires a certain set of character roles to be fulfilled (basically just a romantic or buddy pairing is enough for a zombie movie, although there is flexibility), and that has nothing to do with how many players you happen to have participating. Therefore it would be foolish to attempt to somehow wrangle the story into admitting all player characters equally. So what the game does is, you kill off the extra cast as soon as you've figured out who is extraneous, and have those players perform GM-like duties instead of playing characters. In practice this move towards facilitative play happens already when your character is alive, assuming you're grogging the events and realize well in advance that you're the next victim.<br/><br/>Of course a solution this radical isn't necessary in game where you're willing to make room for a more meandering or ambivalent story that doesn't follow traditional movie storytelling precepts. Also, it's a very interesting question in hindsight as to whether the ideal way to select the protagonist of the story is by having the players compete for it - this tends to mean that the most passive, useless ballast players end up with the GMing duties, and those are exactly the players who are perhaps not the most useful in facilitative roles. Not a problem if you don't have ballast, of course, or if you play to accomodate it.<br/><br/>I notably specifically refused to provide a formula of character development in the rules of the game - I agree with your basic outline dramatically, Rickard, but when designing I felt it more interesting and intellectually honest to leave the strategic aspect up to the players: given that your task is to compose an interesting character, how do <i>you</i> go about it? I've gotten enough feedback about not having relationship maps and such hard coded, though, so maybe that's not the best idea, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411548">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411548/#Comment_411548" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T07:34:46+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  7:34AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2013 7:42AM by Rickard.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only read ZC a year ago once while I was living in Australia, but played it a couple of times with different people. What I felt was lacking in that game was an explanation that the characters must be of different fractions that compete with each other. The game dies if you don't roll the dice. This combined with the mechanism for active listening (the aid die) creates an emergence that usually kills off any character that is slightly evil or otherwise disliked in the story.<br/><br/>So I don't really recognize what you write about killing off extras. Perhaps it's something that you add to the experience that creates that?\n<blockquote>I agree with your basic outline dramatically, Rickard, but when designing I felt it more interesting and intellectually honest to leave the strategic aspect up to the players:</blockquote>\nI think this is a common way of thinking for designers of roleplaying games, and I don't like it. I mostly read the GM chapters in roleplaying games nowadays because I want to know how I should behave when playing that particular game. I want the writer to teach me how to create a successful session over and over again.<br/><br/>These last three years, I've been researching how different roleplaying games tells me how to write an adventure (or play a session). I'm sad to say that not that many have genuine structures for how to play the game.

If you know how those movies go, though, then the game's explanation about how individual interests come into conflict is pretty self-evident. I recognize that the game text could attempt to explain the genre, as many game texts do, but I didn't find that interesting or relevant when writing it. This was probably because I was and am most entertained by seeing how others tackle the simplicity and single-minded narrowness of the game with only what resources they bring it it themselves.<br/><br/>Regarding your efforts in fool-proofing the collaborative game genre, I think that's an entirely valid approach - people have different tastes and needs. Myself, I've got issues with games that attempt to remove player performance from the game - I'm cool with attempting to teach a man to fish, but giving him a fish machine seems weak somehow. Consequently I'm pretty lukewarm on games that are more about getting good story than about getting <em>our</em> story, if you know what I mean. I'm cool with sometimes having bad story if that's the price of freedom in the gameplay - or the price of purposeful dynamic interaction, rather, as that's the heart of game-playing in my mind.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411556/#Comment_411556" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T09:18:15+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  9:18AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Some positive examples of games which do this well:<br/><br/>* Burning Wheel<br/>* In a Wicked Age...<br/>* Sorcerer<br/>* Fiasco (sometimes)</blockquote>\nThe thing with <b>Fiasco</b> is that it mix active, reactive and passive relations and doesn't tell this to the reader. Active relations (agendas) drive the game and the rest creates passive roles. I played IAWA once with another guy GMed it, and it didn't lift for me. But now when I glanced through the book, I see things that he probably missed. I will give Sorcerer and IAWA a read and perhaps come back to you about it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>\n<blockquote>Another interesting example is The Shadow of Yesterday/Solar System (and all its successors, like Lady Blackbird).

I've been playing a lot of fish tanks last year, where the group created a relationship map together before they began to play (a little like the prep for IAWA), and been talking/theorising about active and passive characters with another guy in my gaming group. This is uncharted water for me, because we haven't came to a conclusion. We've just discovered that there <i>are</i> active (driving the story) and passive (supportive or token) characters and what makes them taking that role (the four points in the first post + active/reactive/passive relations).\n<blockquote>One of the problems that RPGs face is that most of our favourite stories feature a singular protagonist, but we like to have a multitude of them. This is not an obvious problem to solve, and well worth considering.</blockquote>\nThat's probably why characters normally are in a adventurous group with a common goal. Having a multitude of protagonists isn't really a problem for me. It was strange when I first came upon this, where each character equals one story such as in <b>Polaris</b>. Later on, I've been playing more games that intertwine different characters in each others stories. This can happen in Polaris as well, but it's nothing that the game itself supports. A lot of the character-intertwining games that I've played starts with one situations that we then create characters from. It's then always up to discussion what the characters are and if we're creating them from a common theme (family members, gold diggers, patients). After the characters are suggested, we choose which character to play.<br/><br/>We've been playing around a lot with relationship maps (<b>Fiasco</b> uses them, as an example) but I've started to wonder if those are necessary. What you need are agendas (active relations) that collides with each other. That's what I feel that <b>Zombie Cinema</b> should be like and enforce; to build a structure around. With the colliding agendas you intertwine the characters' individual stories with each other. Games that do this really well are <b>Psychodrame</b> and <b>While the World Ends</b> but I feel that they don't do it to its extent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411562">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411562/#Comment_411562" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T09:44:59+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  9:44AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weaving disparate characters together is important to almost all games that feature several independent protagonists without an in-built situation that keeps them together. What I've noticed myself is that I like it more when this is done with artistry instead of a formulaic procedure. For example, Fiasco gives us a procedure: ensure that your character's got something going with a couple other characters, and it'll probably suffice. Compare to e.g. TSoY or other similar GMed story-oriented games: there are no guarantees that your characters will be crossed or woven (to use Forge terms) together, except insofar as the GM's interaction with the milieu, the stories and their substance goes.<br/><br/>The last time we played TSoY (well, Solar System set in near-future Dubai) the PCs never ended up forming a party, and their stories only crossed each other sporadically and indirectly. The creative freedom and the consequent tensions were interesting in a way that would have been lost had we had an enforced process for tying the characters together.<br/><br/>Then again, I really admire the way Legends of Alyria uses its story-mapping to produce intimate story-universes within a larger setting. Same for Primetime Adventures. Both of those manage to tie characters together in a way that doesn't feel awkward to me. This probably has something to do with how you create the characters for the situations in those games, instead of first picturing a character and then a posteori inventing the relationships.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411565/#Comment_411565" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T09:53:55+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  9:53AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having tried <b>Zombie Cinema</b> for the first time a few weeks ago, I have to say we struggled. It's interesting to see what Eero writes about the importance of familiarity with the genre: personally speaking I'm a lot more familiar with second generation zombie cinema than, for example, <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>. I think we got that there needed to be conflict but we didn't figure out how to progress the story; people were basically just dicks to each other while running away from the zombies.<br/><br/>I think it is also about style of play. I don't think my group's default position is to max up the antagonism, which is one of the reasons I suspect our <b>Monsterhearts</b> game has perhaps not been quite as "feral" as I'd originally envisioned.

I agree that the key issue is agendas rather than relationships (although relationships can often drive agendas; I wouldn't be inclined to drop relationships entirely in favour of needs).<br/><br/>I really like the character cards in <b>Zombie Cinema</b> and found them quite evocative. I don't know what we would need to make the game work for us, but I don't think dropping them would help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_411567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411567/#Comment_411567" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T09:58:36+00:00" title="April  8, 2013  9:58AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 8, 2013 10:00AM by WarriorMonk.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I think this is a common way of thinking for designers of roleplaying games, and I don't like it. I mostly read the GM chapters in roleplaying games nowadays because I want to know how I should behave when playing that particular game. I want the writer to teach me how to create a successful session over and over again.<br/><br/>These last three years, I've been researching how different roleplaying games tells me how to write an adventure (or play a session). I'm sad to say that not that many have genuine structures for how to play the game. A lot are left unsaid and up to the group to discover.</blockquote>\nYes, I kinda hate this too. It's like the designer is thinking "I'm gonna be a considerate person and don't tell others how to have fun with RPGs because if they are buying my book, they probably know more about this than me" while as a GM I'm actually searching the whole book to find out how do I make it work so my group doesn't give me the bored staaaare for bringing another strange indie game to the table.<br/><br/>And yes, motivations and objectives are such an important part of this that finding all the designer advice about this is "let the players handle that", always makes me drop off the book and go search for another. Maybe I'll hack some parts or systems I find interesting, but again, I'll have to make my own procedures for that, because the option is to have the story start really slow. You'll need to introduce each PC to each other, push them into forming bonds or into killing each other if they are in "reaction mode", creating interests for them (more like fishing if their characters doesn't have any bonds or are afraid of creating ones, something usual with the old school gamers I know) and finally then presenting the main obstacle, to properly start the story... which will still make everything feel rushed.<br/><br/>I've been feeling this way since I was posting at the Forge, I loved Fate aspects for this when I found out about the game, but actually never played Fate because they didn't ever provide a list of inspiring aspects in the character creation chapter. I understand now how they can came up easier while playing but again, without good starting motivations and objectives, players are lost and it takes a lot from the GM to make it work, except in cases when the setting and initial situation makes up for this.<br/><br/>DRyH is a good example of this: strange things start to happen around you because you're not sleeping. Why aren't you sleeping? Just this question gives a friggin kick to the start of the story, incites the player to create bonds and a background in a few phrases. Only thing about DRyH is that I haven't ever guessed where to take it from there, because the setting has a logic of it's own and I sure don't know how to put that in motion. Somehow I feel that if I just react to the player's actions, something will be missing and I can't improvise enough madness to feed the scenes... but that's another different matter.<br/><br/>So back to the point, my solution in the current game i'm working on introduces a <a href="http://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">deck of random tables</a>, which includes motivations. In character creation, two random motivations are drawn and the player choses one as her character's Passion (something she actively searches and is proud of) and the other as her Obsession (a weakness, an attitude that leads her to make things she will later regret)<br/><br/>Add a random emotion related to a random PC or NPC and give players a bonus to their roll whenever the passion, obsession, bond or other aspect comes into play and you're set.<br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_411573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/411573/#Comment_411573" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-08T10:52:50+00:00" title="April  8, 2013 10:52AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've only played Zombie Cinema once, and it was a 50/50 experience for our group. We did get the emergent conflict behaviour Eero discusses, but it wasn't smooth or easy. It was, rather, a game which we played and then thought, "OK, if we play this again a few times, we might get it." However, playing a game which doesn't necessarily work right away can be a hard sell.<br/><br/>I can see some value in setting up a game this way--to challenge the players' skills--but it requires a heavy investment from the players which personally makes me much less likely to play the game (after all, I don't know if I will necessarily enjoy the game even if I do manage to master it, and even then I'd have to figure out how to teach it to new players each time the group changes).<br/><br/>In comparison, though, Eero's Solar System text I find to be incredibly clear in terms who you play the game, why you make certain decisions, and how to use all the parts and pieces to get the effects you need. So there's no question that the "lacking" advisory text was an intentional choice: Eero is very good at explaining how things work!\n<blockquote><br/>I think it is also about style of play. I don't think my group's default position is to max up the antagonism, which is one of the reasons I suspect our <b>Monsterhearts</b> game has perhaps not been quite as "feral" as I'd originally envisioned.

I just wanted to say that this was exactly what I wrote "It All Ends in Tears" for: so a group that isn't already grooving on how the Monsterhearts game should go, and what exactly the genre demands, can just pick up the game and play.

I think it's a writing error to leave this stuff up to the players -- at the very least, you should be telling the players that they have to resolve this stuff before they play!<br/><br/>Dog Eat Dog explicitly requires you to frame your own scene at some point that's organized around an action your character would take in reaction to a specific event (the Occupation). So there's a lot of stuff tied up in that. In order to do that, you have to have an active role -- the game can't continue until you say "Okay, I go do this thing because of this problem." The problem of "what you want" is also heavily tightened up. You might want to work with the Occupation, or fight the Occupation, but you want SOMETHING to do with the Occupation -- we don't have to worry about a longer-term goal. Of course, that's because the duration is intentionally limited! So I think it's all part and parcel of rejecting the "generic game design" frame work and targeting your game at a specific goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
