What are the maneuvers that you can perform upon them?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo prime the pump:  Clearly you can <b>Test</b> them.  This involves going after the least-empowered member of the relationship, and offering them a chance to get something valuable (perhaps, for example, more investment in a different relationship) in exchange for removing themselves yet more from the tested relationship.  The result of successive tests where the relationship is abandoned would be a relationship that degenerates into only one person being invested in it ... rejection!<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  Momo and Toji are in love, but Sai (oh, wicked, evil Sai!  When will you ever learn?) sets up an elaborate deception meant to convince Momo that Toji is two-timing her.  Will Momo back away from Toji, or will she have faith in him?<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat else?

Strengthening the relationship.<br/>B.  Weakening the relationship.<br/>C.  Personal profit<br/><br/>A &amp; B are mutually exclusive of course, but C can be done in conjunction with either of the other two.  So we have five distinct types of goals: A, B, C, AC, and BC.<br/><br/>A = Nurturing<br/>B = Neglecting<br/>C = Exploiting<br/>AC = Manipulating<br/>BC = Sabotaging<br/><br/>Missing from this model is an operator for changing the nature of a relationship.  I posit that a better way to model this would be to create a new relationship alongside the old one.  So if Bob is friends with Carol, but wants something more, he doesn't perform an operation on the "friendship" relationship, he creates a new "lovers" relationship which he then nurtures.  <br/><br/>Of course, these relationships can affect one another.  Does Bob ruin their friendship by trying to get Carol to sleep with him?  This brings up what is at least to my mind a key point: operations on relationships are not necessarily unary.  They can also be binary.<br/><br/>What if Bob's player had a choice?  He could try to do a simple Nurture on the "lovers" relationship for potential modest gain, or he could put the "friendship" relationship at risk...maybe for potentially higher gain.  <br/><br/>This model can then easily be brought to bear in other social situations.  I want Bonnie to try to drive a wedge between Kim and Monique.  I can do this by having Bonnie talk general trash about Kim and hope that works.  Or I can have Bonnie make nice with Monique so that she can more easily plant her seeds of friendship destruction.  This is the opposite of what I did with Bob and Carol, instead of weakening one relationship for the final goal of strengthening another, I am strengthening one relationship with the final goal of weakening another.  I'm not entirely sure that these are different operations, but they might be.<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm not sure if these observations are useful with respect to your game, Tony, or even if all of what I typed is even fully compatible with itself, but whatever it was, this stream of consciousness has petered out for me at least for the moment.  I hope it dislodged something of use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108404/#Comment_108404" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T11:38:12+00:00" title="November 15, 2007 11:38AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D.

Comedies like <i>Ranma 1/2</i> use confusion of identity and circumstance to throw this kind of thing into stark relief, but it's only funny in the extreme because the milder case is something we're all so familiar with.<br/><br/>I don't know what that means in terms of mechanics.  I get what you're saying about goals, but goals and maneuvers aren't usually the same thing.  If I go into a D&amp;D game and someone asks me "So what are you going to do?" and I respond with "My goal is to make the orc dead without becoming dead myself!" then ... well, I've only done one step in the process.  I've got the "Why?" and now I need to elaborate upon the "How?" for people.<br/><br/>Similarly, I think that saying "Strengthening the relationship is my goal" may not get to the "How" of the thing.  That said, the leverages you're talking about between different relationships may provide just the sort of tactical options that make the "How" interesting.

At least one person must be common to both relationships.<br/><b>Conflict</b>:  Attempts to weaken one relationship greatly, at the expense of weakening another slightly.<br/><br/>Technically you could have one that increases both relationships ... but would that be interesting?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108409">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108409/#Comment_108409" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T11:53:13+00:00" title="November 15, 2007 11:53AM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>The investment thing is key, Tony, because who controls the relationship is situational.</blockquote>Uh ... is it?<br/><br/>Like, I can totally see that if math-geek Darren is tutoring cheerleader Tawny in algebra then who is in charge of the <i>active relationship</i> between them changes based on their situation.

I looked through the thread and saw a lot of individual suggestions and some of them seemed like different ways of saying the same thing and some suggestions seemed to encompass multiple things.<br/><br/>Your example of "Test" in particular had me thinking.  Sure, you could test a relationship to weaken it, but you could also test a relationship when you wanted to strengthen it.  "If you loved me, you would..."  So I tried to start out with some bare fundamentals and goals were where I chose to start.  I agree that goals may not be the way to define these operations.  Still, thought about it does inform us why a player might choose to do them.<br/><br/>I definitely think that playing relationships off each other is essential for this model, but it is tricky.  If I try to strengthen relationship X and weaken relationship Y, what happens if I fail?  I doubt you want a huge list of possible maneuvers.

I don't think we can really draw a line and say "This stuff, here, is material that we could not possibly intuit at the table ... it can only be the result of system."  After all, I intuitively <i>know</i> when a relationship increases or weakens, how strong it is, and all that jazz too.  But I want to model <b>something</b>, both because I'm out of a job otherwise and because what I intuitively know is seldom clear to (or agreed upon by) other people at the table.  It strikes me as less a question of what things transcend intuition, and more a question of which elements we create explicit markers for, to supplement and express our intuition.<br/><br/>I suspect that having multiple relationships would be a useful tool for people to explicitly express some of their intuitions about their characters.  I'm concerned that the complexity could get in the way, making it a strait-jacket rather than a tool.  You seem to have opinions related to this.

You might call it the beginning of ethics, and it's quite deeply ingrained. It's probably a specific way to be mean or test a relationship rather than an independent class of action, but it's fundamental enough that it might merit a mention.<br/><br/>Being unfair on a regular basis - or, in less flattering terms, cheating and stealing - is pretty much the best way to get ahead in life with regards to cost/benefit analysis, so it makes sense that you'd have to evolve some serious negative consequences for a group to remain stable. After all, altruism may or may not pay off later, but cheating pays off right now 100% of the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
