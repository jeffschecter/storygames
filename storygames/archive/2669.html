Your CE forum has a similar advantage. You also get the passing traffic effect (from the posts since lst visit effect) and it's more neutral as a location so people are more open to critiquing or contributing than if it's your site.<br/><br/>Disadvantage wise , it breaks the users context of use, which can be a problem as it's jarring and confusing for people expecting a single site (and for the love of Pete don't open the forum in a new window). It also means you may get less traffic from folks who don't like the atmosphere wherever your forum is.<br/><br/>If you want to chat about site stuff more generally, drop me a mail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61360/#Comment_61360" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T14:48:36+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  2:48PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Because I so rarely drop below the Actual Play forum at the Forge, I'm not sure, but is there the same sort of posting style/rules on the publisher sites as on the main site? <br/><br/>In other words, if I want to drop in and say "Hey man, your game rules, I wanted to combine it with this other game that sucks, anyway what's up" would the next post be "thread closed, do not post so casually, spend some time thinking about what you want to say"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61361/#Comment_61361" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T14:59:15+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  2:59PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, tough question.

Consider doing some forum-special material, host discussions, and otherwise bribe people with content to come and stay.

When i last enquired about it, oh, probably 5 years ago [i think it was 2002--did the Forge exist then?--it would've been a year or two after we produced our beta edition of Four Colors al Fresco], Ron's response was that they didn't create publisher-specific fora proactively, but only in reaction to a certain, noticable, level of traffic about a particular game. So, talk about your game on the Forge, and if enough people start talking about it, they'll create a dedicated forum. Me, i (1) don't communicate comfortably, effectively, or satisfactorily in the style that the general Forge forum rules dictate*, and (2) am pretty much an introvert, so i'm not likely to start discussions so much as respond to them. So that strategy just isn't gonna work for me.<br/><br/><span style="font-size: xx-small; font-size: xx-small;">*In case anybody cares: 1: i proceed from the abstract to the concrete. Asking me to ground an issue in a specific example often won't work (because, early in the discussion, i won't know how it relates to concrete examples), and i can discuss purely-hypothetical abstract stuff for ages before suddenly i recognize a relevant concrete application. Likewise, you can give me concrete applications 'til the cows come home, and i might never be able to extrapolate the common theoretical explanation being illustrated. [This learning style issue is what killed me in Chem.] 2: i find the frequent dependency of threads really frustrating to read. If thread A is sufficiently relevant to discussion B that B starts off with something like "This is a followup to A" and a link to same, that pretty much says to me "i should go read A before reading B. At which point, I'd rather that it was simply a continuation of A, not a new thread. I.e., i see thread necromancy as not merely not-bad, but actively good. 3: In concert with abstract-to-concrete thinking pattern, i'm also more random [than sequential], meaning my best ideas often start out with a pointless "hey, i just thought of this!" sort of idea, which, in dialogue with others, evolves into a something specific to say. IOW, if i wait until i have a concrete, supportable point to make before i start talking, i often just won't ever start talking. Which is the other half (along with the introversion) of why i respond to more than begin discussions--because somewhere around 80 posts into the discussion is when my own ideas gel for me. 4: I'm a slow thinker. Rarely will a new idea enlighten me, or a new POV persuade me, in less than a week or so of ruminating over it. Which gets back to the thread necromancy thing, again--I'm usually ready to contribute to a thread about 48hrs after everyone else has tired of it. Plus, i usually am verbose, short on time, and like to consider my own posts. So i prefer to write something, then sit on it for a day or two before posting, making sure it seems worth contributing, and editing and tightening it up. I'm trying to break that habit in fora that have a generally-faster turnover time (which, these days, is all of them. How i miss UseNet).</span><br/><br/>Hmmm...kinda got carried away there. Well, in defiance of my general proclivities, i'll post it anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61701/#Comment_61701" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-21T08:28:13+00:00" title="March 21, 2007  8:28AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, I believe that what Nat said are the criteria are still Ron's criteria. Your game has to be part of the community dialog, and you have to be part of it as well outside of your own game, too, before you're likely to get your own forum on the Forge.<br/>\n<br/>\nJD hits the nail on the head in terms of what traffic you'll get. Which is why many people do both Forge and local fora. If you link to both off your web-page, it usually works pretty well, from what I've seen and experienced. There is some dilution and repetition that occurs, but not so much as it denies the positive effects of having both channels.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
