                    I know not every game design concerns itself with an "ain't never played" audience. My Life With Master very clearly assumes a group of players who already have a formed opinion of what typically goes on in mainstream games.<br/><br/>What about everyone else? Do you want your game to be playable by me? By my sister who's never played? By this guy I know who's only played D&amp;D? Can I get your game instead of D&amp;D on my eleventh birthday? Will I know what to do? Or do you want me to bust my chops somewhere else first?<br/><br/>Based on how you answer that question, answer another! How does your assumption influence your instructions? How do you explain character creation, assuming there is any? How do you explain preparation?<br/><br/>For those who aren't writing games, what's missing from the games you buy? I mean even things that you already know how to do? What do you do in play that isn't written in the book?<br/><br/>I've been thinking a lot about that stuff lately. It's driving me mad. Mad I say. So mad I can't use exclamation marks.                </div>

                            I'd like everything I write to be a gateway.<br/><br/>Based on which, I don't address an audience of roleplayers - I particularly don't address an audience of people who are interested in roleplaying theory. I address a (so far imaginary) audience of people who have some idea what a game is, may or may not have played roleplaying games before, have read at least some fiction, and know no jargon.<br/><br/>I address them the same way I would address people who were reading the rules for a board game, in other words, and talk about character creation in terms of characters in fiction (for the "soft" bits) and game mechanics (for the "hard" bits).<br/><br/>I'm aware that I need to explain a whole lot more. One of my greatest weaknesses is that I don't explain things because I think they're obvious - but nobody else finds them obvious at all.                        </div>

                            I don't assume you know anything, but I do assume you've played with toys as a chil and made up stories with them.<br/><br/>Now if I could only get the graphics end down! I also assume that the audience I'm writing for doesn't want to read a lengthy book about playing initially.                        </div>

                            Depends on the game.<br/><br/><em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> is written as a geek-gateway game.  You don't have to have roleplayed before, but you do need to have some sort of feel for etherships and the planets of the inner solar system.  The book sets out everything -- and I mean everything -- that I could think of step-by-step in the process of building your game.  It also has a whole lot of options for structure and social context, which is something I always dig on.  But by picking everything apart and laying it out in order, I learned a lot about the structure of games.<br/><br/>Which means for my next project, <em>Sons of Liberty</em>, which is geared to be as universal as possible (well, for Americans, at least), I'm looking forward to ditching a lot of the plodding step-by-step details and going for a very slick social context design that works without the players being very aware of its operation.  Theoretically speaking, I should be able to simply describe the one way that the game is supposed to be played, rather than lay out all the options available to the players.  That's the plan, anyway.<br/><br/>Now, were I to bring some gamer-spoof sort of book to production, say the Royal Subterranean Diplomatic Corps thing that we're talking about elsethread, I'd heave wheelbarrowfuls of assumptions in there, because the book as a product will only appeal to the gamers in the first place, so there's no reason for explaining things they already know.                        </div>

                            I think about this a lot.  It's much easier to write for an audience that's already on the bus, and potentially off-putting to them to write for the guys waiting to get on.  I tried to walk a middle line with The Roach, probably not doing the greatest job of catering to either group.  Grey Ranks isn't for people who aren't on the bus.  In the text I say "Every player in a Grey Ranks game will create and play a character of their own" and then jump into the process without additional explanation of why that is necessary, why that is a good thing, why that is a fun choice.                        </div>

<em>City of Birds</em> is generally aimed at people who have tried role-playing games at least once before, though not necessarily capital "G" Gamers. For that first group, the goal is definitely to say, "Role-playing doesn't have to be like that stuff you tried and didn't much like. Try this." To the existing gamers, it's saying, "Role-playing is is broader than you thought, try this too." Something aimed at complete neophytes would have to be written quite differently.                        </div>

                            For <i>The Mountain Witch</i>, I made the assumption that the audience would have a superficial familiarity with the subject matter, both in regard to samurai drama and RPGs. I think this is reasonable, I didn't see tMW as a game that just anyone would pick up and play. I assumed that the players would either have an interest in samurai stuff or RPGs or both.<br/><br/>Because of this, I was able to bypass base-level questions, like who the samurai were and the history of Japan, as well as "what we do" in RPGs and why we play. However, I didn't assume that players could just pick the game up and go. I still gave a very procedural explanation of the game along with some theorectical/design reasons for why the game works the way it does. I also highlighted those details about samurai and Japan that I thought were relevent to play.<br/><br/>Another assumption I made was that players could figure some stuff out themselves. Thus I assumed that if I provided the player with principles, they would be able to figure out how to apply those in play. This played into some of theorectical comments, as well as many of the short sections on samurai history and whatnot.                        </div>

                            For the most part, I'm with Tim.  I assume that there is at least one person in the group who has a passing familiarity with RPGs, and also my subject material.  This gets tailored for each game, of course.  For Bliss Stage, I'm trying to assume less about familiarity with RPGs (I do assume a familiarity with the concept-- but I want to include those that only know of journal, chat, and forum methods.) and assume a nigh-obsessive familiarity with the anime source material.  For The Drifter's Escape, I'm trying to assume no familiarity with RPGs, but I can assume absolute and total knowledge of the source material, since the rest of the book is chock full of it.<br/><br/>In any of these case, a procedural explanation of the game, literally step by step and decision by decision, was an absolute must.<br/><br/>I think that too many people try to shoot their games at non-gamers.  It's a shame, really, because they end up doing it quite poorly.  I'd rather have a few very well done introduction books than a million shoddily written cop-out "how to role-play" sections.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>
