What had been a fairly cooperative relationship among the players devolved into the Chopper taking over the Hocus' town, including a running battle across ther desert between the Chopper's and Gunlugger's gangs.  The Gunlugger, badly wounded, his gang scattered across the desert, made it to his mutant medic girlfriend, earned his last advance by facing down one of the Chopper's gang, and retired to safety.  He and his woman escaped the rapidly deteriorating situation to start a new hold somewhere over the rainbow, or wherever.  (And now I want to play Apocalypse Oz.)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Hocus tried to seize back control of the town by riling up the mob.  The Chopper used her Hx to cause the Hocus'  roll to bomb, and the crowd tore him limb from limb.  The Chopper, as a last "what the hell" kind of act, opened her brain.  She failed, and the part of the maelstrom that had been encouraging cannibalism as a spiritual practice poisoned her soul.  The last image of the game was of the Chopper thinking the Hocus' brains looked mighty good.<br/><br/>Things I liked best about the game as a whole: how it would suddenly hit high gear and go spiralling off into crazy directions, where stuff just flowed from one event to another.  The twists when I caame up with a really good move for a failed roll.  Also the small moments of tenderness that oaccasionally came into play.<br/><br/>Things I liked least: I don't think I ever became truly comfortable with the Maelstrom.  It's a very important element, and it ties into the cause of the Apocalypse, so I felt like I should treat it as something that needed to be pre-defined and revealed, rather than a more organic thing that the players were defining through play.   I never got "loose" with it.  Also, it "belonged" to just one player.  The other two had little interest in opening their brains and such, so I didn't have much room to set up PC-Malestrom-PC triangles, so to speak.  <br/><br/>I'd really like to play again, but preferably not as the MC next time.<br/><br/>Up next: one shots and pick-up games, probably starting with Shock.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_299286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299286/#Comment_299286" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-04T07:16:58+00:00" title="November  4, 2010  7:16AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember Tomorrow: Session 2.<br/><br/>We created awesome characters and a kind of ripe world/setting for play (via factions and character details) in the previous session. Played six scenes, had some difficulties.<br/><br/>Session two: Fell flat. We had problems interacting with the system, one of the players very conceptually. We found a lot to love in the game, and had a really ripe setup that we were all behind, but we couldn't keep it moving through the full session time. <br/><br/>"(reads) Oh, hey, turns out we were doing that wrong" had become the phrase of the evening, despite three of the four players having read the text a few times.<br/><br/>A lot of good came out of it, though: Again, the setup and characters. Also, Matthew G was able to put together a 9-page notes doc that summarized/streamlined the game. Matthew is going to put together the thoughts and details of our successes and problems with our run on his blog at some point.<br/><br/>Also, I'll likely give it another shot, cause I have some ideas of making it work better, likely even next week.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299610/#Comment_299610" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-06T09:37:34+00:00" title="November  6, 2010  9:37AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zombie Cinema.

They're there to barter for a cure to "The Blight."<br/><br/>A noxious fog rolls in from the sea, and it's as thick as pea soup, requiring the Chopper's gang to walk their bikes through the campus.  They see lights and hear shambling movements here and there.  The Maestro D' reads the sitch and misses.  That's when one of the gang notices that the Maestro D' and one of the gang members are missing.  "We're being picked off one by one in the fog, boss!"  The Chopper orders the gang to circle their bikes on the roof of a parking garage and he and The Faceless go off looking for the missing ones.  They find them ultimately but they are being held as dinner.  The two are completely surrounded by about two dozen feral mutants and going aggro on the ringleader has gone pear-shaped.  I'm calculating the Harm these freaks are going to soon be inflicting on the encircled group and thinking "Ugh.  Shortest. AW. Campaign.

Unmasking stuns them long enough for him to be able to make his mad case; he buys the Hocus move "Frenzy" with the advance he'd just earned.  He rolls his Weird+1 for the Frenzy move.

The rodian tech Ona keeps offering to help them repair their ship, but they don't trust her. She warns them that the rodian scavenger ship will come back soon, but they don't free her. She offers up info on a 5K credit bounty on one of her fellow captives if they free her, they refuse to let her go. They then threaten to send her adrift in the rodian shuttle they used to board the Dragonfly with no fuel and only life support. They don't ask for anything, they just threaten her.<br/><br/>After working for almost an hour, one of the PCs comes to Ona and asks her about the armament of the rodian ship in case it comes back. She scoffs, tells them she's been trying to help them, she'd love to get off the rodian ship, she never wanted to be a ganger scavenger, it wasn't the life she chose... but now she doesn't trust them at all and since they're only going to send her adrift with her compatriots, they might as well go ahead and do so, she won't help them at all now.

I literally read the book through our first round, reading right from it and doing what it told us, and there were NO moments of unclarity, misunderstanding, etc. This is incredible, because the last like 10 board games I played were nowhere near as easy to understand as this, and weren't even as complicated. Tons of easy and complicated examples aided in understanding, but we didn't even need them.<br/><br/>Kind of a dumb thing to get excited over, but man, what a well-written instruction book.

Totally blows a Guts check (until some Bennie expenditure.)<br/><br/>She summons up enough courage to rush up and blast the zombies, but just after she hurls the spell, she's just frozen, heavy breathing, shaking with fear.  The undead close in and she drops back, trying to come up with something else to do.  The rest of the party get embroiled in melee, but one of the animals they brought with them has his neck savagely broken (with an obscene exploding damage roll).<br/><br/>Her next action... she went to her happy place.  Invisibility.  When we left off, she's hanging just on the edge of their lantern lite.  They suspect she's run off into the dark of the caves, but this far in, she'd easily get hopelessly lost.  She's not sure if it's safer to stay with them or to try for the surface on her own.<br/><br/>It's like someone got Little Fears all over my DesertPunk.<br/><br/>Still, the highlight of the session was probably (before the zombies showed) walking up to a captured NPC, grabbing him by his shirt and forcing him down to her eye level and putting the fear of GIRL into him.  "You better tell us who you work for mister, or he'll shoot you.  I've seen him, and he's good."  Worked way better than expected.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_301361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301361/#Comment_301361" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T23:17:59+00:00" title="November 18, 2010 11:17PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>Our First Session in Decimation City, where 50 years ago the superheroes went to fight something and never came back, and the next day, 9 in 10 people disappeared without a trace.<br/><br/>Damson the Battlebabe is worried about his gig at the Sunset Cabaret, Hammer the Chopper is freaked out by Weird goings-on at the Rainbow Bridge, and Jones the Brainer is worried that his successor is out there somewhere, looking for him.
