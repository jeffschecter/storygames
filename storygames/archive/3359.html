So, I'm trying to better understand GM-less games.  Paul suggested I start a thread here to get some input.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>So I'm thinking about the GM-less mode and how it related to what I've been doing with the game using a GM. That means I've been mentally analyzing the GM-less games I have (Polaris, Contenders, The Shab-al-Hiri Roach, uh, off the top of my head) and will pour through them tonight and tomorrow, but the conclusion I'm drawing at this moment is that to make a GM-less game work, you have to be telling separate stories in parallel.  In a GM-ed game, you can tell one story with several participants at the same time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Tevis</cite>I've have confused thoughts about GM-less games that I can't quite articulate right now. Let's just say that my experience with both Polaris and The Roach has led me to conclude that you can have GM-less games that do something other than separate stories in parallel. You can tell one story with several participants at the same time, however, it will look slightly different than that story would look if you had a GM.  My own experience with GM-less games is somewhat limited, and I think that other people\xe2\u20ac\u2122s perspective (especially, say, Jason Morningstar's) would be useful.</blockquote>\nFirst of all, I've played Polaris once (though that was enough to count now as one of my favorite games) and The Shab-al-Hiri Roach once.  I have Contenders in my library.  (Yes, I need more in my library.  This will be remedied at GenCon.)  So, that's the experience I have and that experience tells me the following:<br/><br/>GM-less games inherently require more structure than a game with a GM.  Now this is not at bad this at all, and I like games with structure as much as I like games that force me to be the structure.  But this is there for the next point.<br/><br/>Games in general need someone to get the ball rolling in a given "scene."  Often a GM's job is to get that ball rolling.  In <em>Full Light, Full Steam</em> it's the players' job to get that ball rolling, but each time it's a specific player.  We tend to call this "Scene Framing", and the GM-less games I've ready place the job of scene framing on the individuals in a "everyone takes their turn on this" sense.<br/><br/>Furthermore, as the authority is distributed, you're generally given a limited authority to frame scenes.  In The Roach, you frame scenes around your character.  You can bring other characters in, sure, but the scene is about your character and need not involve anyone else.  In Polaris, you either frame scenes for yourself or for whom you're playing the adversarial role.  In Contenders, it actually uses the term "Spotlight character" to say that when you're framing a scene, it's all about you (even if you bring others into the scene).<br/><br/>So, that leads me to believe that it's necessary for a GM-less game to involve heavy scene-framing and spotlight characters.  To continue that idea, it feels like in order to have that feel organic in play, said players should have their own storylines that, at best, intertwine with the other characters.  The farthest form this idea, I think, is The Roach, and I think that only works because it's stated to be a competitive RPG.  In a collaborative, GM-less game, it seems like having the group constantly together would be an exercise in constantly stepping on one another's toes.<br/><br/>My Life With Master, which has a GM, feels like a GM-less game (to where I pulled it off the shelf and put it into my GM-less games research pile) because it's about individual stories that happen to perhaps cross paths more than a group-story.<br/><br/>So, here's what I'm asking:  Tell me why I'm wrong.  Blow my assumptions out of the water.  (Alternatively, if by some fluke I know what I'm talking about, could you tell me why?)  Help me better understand this topic I'm heavily interested in.<br/><br/>Thank you.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75962/#Comment_75962" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T13:14:02+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  1:14PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, <i>Capes</i> always has everybody playing in a given scene ... but it's up to them which character they choose each time.

That makes some things harder and others easier.  Structure is obviously helpful to GMless games because that's a bit of authority usually relegated to the GM.  Your comments about framing scenes around individuals strikes me as good advice in any game, but it is often codified in GMless ones (again, because of authority distribution issues).  I'd be careful not to pigeon hole what is essentially a new way or organizing games along broad lines, because some clever dude is definitely going to shoot you down in the fullness of time.  GMless games require heavy scene framing?  I guess the current crop point in this direction, but that's because we're learning as we go.  <br/><br/>I can tell you from happy experience that a GMless game that enthusiastically focuses on the player characters as a functional unit can be successful and satisfying.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75970">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/talysman" title="talysman"><img alt="talysman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/talysman">talysman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75970/#Comment_75970" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T13:29:18+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  1:29PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>The trick to GM-less games is, in reality, you're just distributing the GM tasks in some way, so the real thing you need to be looking at is how the tasks are distributed.</p>\n<p>A couple years ago, I started a book project on GM-less gaming (and then a computer crash wiped out all my notes, but that's another story.)

When deciding whether to play a game GM-less or not, the big question is "what is the potential GM's biggest role?" If it's just to provide adversity, and if you have parallel stories, scene-to-scene GM shifts seem perfect. If it's to act as teacher and world, session-to-session or game-to-game shifts (essential, standard GMing) seem perfect.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75977/#Comment_75977" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-15T13:42:36+00:00" title="June 15, 2007  1:42PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>The trick to GM-less games is, in reality, you're just distributing the GM tasks in some way, so the real thing you need to be looking at is how the tasks are distributed.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>I think this is totally crap.</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>GM-less games inherently require more structure than a game with a GM.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is also not true.

Do try to think of it as giving players powers that they need to play from the ground up.<br/>\n<br/>\nI might be getting a bit ego-centric here, but it's just possible that many GM-less RPGs have scene framing because Universalis used scene framing as a way to create structure for play (or maybe because scene-framing was a design fad at the time). But it's absolutely not neccessary, either. Universalis does not have spotlight characters or anything like it. What's important to be in a scene is completely up to the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nConsider that many people play "Freeform RPGs" sans GM all the time that may or may not have any sort of explicit scene-framing. In which there is no mechanical structure, in fact, and the rule is just to try to honor the contributions of the other players. There's no absolute need for anything beyond this. All other structures laid on top must exist to achieve some goal of design.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for play having to be about crossing stories... well, nope. I could see a game like InSpectres being done GM-less. In which you have a very strong centralizing concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd propose that most GM-less RPGs are a bit primitive (Universalis probably being the most primitive, unsurprisingly).

GMed games have about as much structure -- it's just a lot of it is either implied or habitual on the part of the play group.  But when writing a GMless game, your audience is almost certainly already enculturated in GMed games, and therefore you need to be more explicit about things.<br><br>Additionally, though, GMed games require a more delicate and balanced structure than GMed games.  There are counterexamples and well-designed, well-balanced GMed games, but at the end of the day, GMed games can rely on GM fiat.  It's an option available to GMed games that is not available to GMless games.  A lot of GMed games use GM-as-final-arbiter as a sort of last-ditch safety valve.  GMless games can, at best, appeal to group consensus, and that's nowhere near as simple or clear as what one guy says.<br><br>Alternately, you can rely on that group consensus and assume that your play groups are capable of productively settling their differences.  I would submit that that is just offloading design work on your play group (just like telling the GM to 'create a story' and not giving him any actual tools with which to do that).<br><br>And on that topic, you mentioned <em>FLFS</em>, which by default is GMed, but can be played GMless, and actually plays that way rather well.  The dice mechanic becomes more explicitly narration-shuffling than stakes-resolution, and everybody picks NPCs to portray when they get framed into scenes.  The work needed to convert to GMless is minimal, and I will probably be better elaborating what needs to be done when I get around to second edition.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>So, that leads me to believe that it's necessary for a GM-less game to involve heavy scene-framing and spotlight characters.</blockquote>\nHere, I'll be pedantic, now!  <em>Every</em> game requires scene-framing; many GMed games just give that whole omnibus of responsibility to the GM.  But <em>somebody</em> has to say where the characters are and what's happening, if only to kick things off.<br><br>Spotlight characters... meh.  Universalis has no GM and does not have spotlight characters.  They're handy and all -- but they're generally handy, in GMless and GMed games.

It is also true that, as you suggest, this can be reconceptualized in terms of "social proof" -- but again, social proof is frequently considered a GM task, especially those games with a vision of a strong, powerful GM. Either way, you can distribute this in various ways: make the power of social proof fleeting, changing hands from moment to moment, based on either a rigid structure (rotate around the table) or a mechanical bonus (award dice or bonuses when you see something you like happen,) or whatever.</p>\n<p>So, I don't agree that you've proved my statement wrong, but I think you've expanded it for those who misinterpret it as being only about authority or veto power.</p>\n<p>In the post I linked to, I actually spent more time not on veto power or social proof, but on elements like setting, characters, situation, system, and color, because although affirmation and veto are certainly the most powerful of the traditional GM tasks, contribution and interpretation form the majority of thoses tasks. A traditional GMed game is notable mainly in that one person describes the setting, introduces supporting characters, creates the adversity, interprets the rules, resolves rules disputes, and fleshes out most of the other details, while the other players traditional contribute only a very tiny portion related to "their" characters. As games challenge this traditional arrangement in various ways, they either soften the GM's power by giving other players some small power to contribute in these areas, or they farm out one or more of these tasks to other people, or they decentralize the tasks completely or rotate the entire package of tasks among the players, using a variety of methods.</p>\n<p>To focus this more directly to what Ryan is looking for: whether or not a GM-less game is destined to turn into parallel stories probably depends specifically on how adversity is handled. For example, Rune rotates adversity and setting as a package, with each player taking turns designing situations for the group as a whole and basing the difficulty on the number of characters in the adventuring party. This forces players to keep their characters together, mainly because there are no provisions on what to do if the party splits. In Polaris, by contrast, the current player of adversity (Mistaken) does not scale the threat except through Drama, so there is no pressure to keep characters together (I forget: is there even a benefit of having other knights in the scene?)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76052/#Comment_76052" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T01:17:38+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  1:17AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 16, 2007 1:17AM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Hey Ryan, what are you thinking, and what can we do to help?  I think this is a super interesting discussion.</blockquote>\nSo, I'm working on my Game Chef game, <a href="http://mastermines.wordpress.com/projects/know-thyself/" rel="nofollow">Know Thyself</a>, which is a game where you wake up without any memories, with some items significant to you, inside of this surreal, maze-like palace, and you're gaining memories as your dealing with issues &amp; challenges of the palace.  Here are the highlights of the system (in short):<br/>* Conflict resolution involves, as a result, your character regaining a memory<br/>* As a player, you have a choice: narrate your success/failure, or narrate your memory.  You always only get one or the other, your choice, and the GM narrates the other after you.<br/>* The sort of memory you get is based on aspects of the conflict resolution &amp; your location in the palace -- the conflict resolution is card-based, and the suits tell us the "flavor" of memory you get (say, a guilt or a triumph), which of your items it relates to (say you have a rose or a picture of an '87 Honda Accord).  The elements of that memory are based on the room you're in, such as the Garden of Necessary Deceit will involve the idea of "Necessary Deceit" somehow.  So, say guilt + picture of the Honda + Necessary Deceit means you remember the pain of having to plant the explosive in your best friend's card, once he found out about your true occupation.  (What's your true occupation?  you haven't regained a memory about that yet.)<br/>* The palace map is a physical thing you play on.  In the Game Chef edition, it was a defined map.  In the latest iteration (which isn't up yet), it's a random, card-based map, kinda like Dungeoneer.<br/><br/>The major piece I'm missing:<br/>* The primary motivation/kicker.  I don't know why people should do anything in the first place.  I was lucky in my playtests in that most people did something, but not everyone felt invested in it and I need to resolve that.<br/><br/>You might see how I'm not talking about it being GM-less yet.  Well, honestly, I don't see the GM role being strong here, and I'm exploring ways to solve my biggest problem with the game.  I wouldn't mind completely ditching it, because this is a non-traditional enough of a game to where the GM is not an assumed element.  But, and here's where I'm having a problem: <em>I'm not sure how to construct the framework for this game as I've described it that would allow for all the player-characters to be together -- <strong>in every scene</strong>* as they walk around the palace -- that would achieve some interesting play without a central, detached adversity role the GM provides.</em> (emphasis to make sure the text isn't lost).  Making this a GM-less game is easy -- I just make it so people are wandering around the palace separately, maybe crossing paths on occasion.<br/><br/>(*They might break off naturally, and that's okay, but if the game <em>requires</em> them to break off, it's not achieving the above.)<br/><br/>In short: I want to ditch the GM (for at least half of the game, as I'm open to the idea of having two modes of play), but I don't know if that means I have to ditch that without ditching party unity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76053/#Comment_76053" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T01:29:19+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  1:29AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>Alternately, you can rely on that group consensus and assume that your play groups are capable of productively settling their differences.</blockquote>\nI think this is a healthy proto-design decision (maybe not relying on consensus, but relying on mature productivity).

My game is so utterly, irrevocably wrapped around the characters as individuals because it's about discovering who they are.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>I think, though, that it would be relatively easy to make a GMed game with a central story -- you just need to provide a centering mechanic that gives players an incentive for working on the same storyline.</blockquote>\nThis comment (and everything else, but all of it sinking in as I'm chewing on this comment) makes me wonder if -- because of my focus on individual characters rather than a collective story -- the above framework I want to achieve is a fool's errand.<br/><br/>Even if not, this thread has helped me better articulate to myself and others what Know Thyself is about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pigeon" title="pigeon"><img alt="pigeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pigeon">pigeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76064/#Comment_76064" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T02:34:30+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  2:34AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently working on a game -- Facing the Beast -- in which there is no GM, nor division of GM power amongst the players; the opposition to the players is created by the strict requirements of the rules, and players frame their own scenes according to the things they want to accomplish.  Partly this is because I do think the GM role is inherently problematic and mostly an artifact of tradition, but partly it's just because I don't want anybody to have to play the Beast.<br/><br/><br/>I say "no division of GM power amongst the players" mostly because there are several things in this list:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: talysman</cite>A traditional GMed game is notable mainly in that one person describes the setting, introduces supporting characters, creates the adversity, interprets the rules, resolves rules disputes, and fleshes out most of the other details, while the other players traditional contribute only a very tiny portion related to "their" characters.</blockquote>\nthat I don't consider GM powers even in traditional games -- most notably interpreting the rules and resolving rules disputes, which are not powers I have much interest in signing away.  When analyzing GM powers at this deep level, I think it's important to remember that at its heart a roleplaying game is just a social get-together, and groups are generally pretty good at nominating the people best suited to filling social lubricant roles such as "interprets the rules" (which is really "makes decisions everyone can agree on") and "resolves rules disputes" (which is really "resolves social conflicts and restores peace").  Trying to take all these roles away from the people who have earned them essentially by merit and pin them to the guy who's good at "creating the adversary" (a role which is unfortunately pretty unique to roleplaying games) isn't going to improve anything (at best, everybody will ignore it) and at worst create seriously dysfunctional interactions.  In practice, I think you'll find that when these situations DO come up in most functioning trad game groups, the GM steps back and the person who happens to be aces at that particular lubricant takes over seamlessly, without anybody talking about it or even thinking about it very much -- if they did think about it, they'd either be uncomfortable about the weird power dynamic or the direct violation of the rules in the book in favor of the rules in everybody's heads.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>You might see how I'm not talking about it being GM-less yet.  Well, honestly, I don't see the GM role being strong here, and I'm exploring ways to solve my biggest problem with the game.  I wouldn't mind completely ditching it, because this is a non-traditional enough of a game to where the GM is not an assumed element.  But, and here's where I'm having a problem:<em>I'm not sure how to construct the framework for this game as I've described it that would allow for all the player-characters to be together --<strong>in every scene</strong>* as they walk around the palace -- that would achieve some interesting play without a central, detached adversity role the GM provides.</em>(emphasis to make sure the text isn't lost).  Making this a GM-less game is easy -- I just make it so people are wandering around the palace separately, maybe crossing paths on occasion.</blockquote>\nThere's a pretty clear implicit assumption here, which is that the GM can't also have a PC in the scene, and I'm not sure why you have that assumption.  Maybe the GM's PC always plays a supporting role in the scene.  Maybe every conflict is actually specifically between two PCs, and everything else is "say yes."  Maybe everybody frames a conflict for the person to their left in every single scene, and it's all one big mishmash of conflicts, where you all go in turns reacting to the person on your left and then creating problems for the person on your right.  Maybe everybody frames their own conflict for themselves!  (Yeah, Czege says it's a bad idea.)<br/><br/>Or maybe opposition comes from another direction.  From the rules -- there's a list of rooms, each with a specific type of conflict you can have in them with that room.  From the players -- same deal, except you make up the list of rooms.  From the group's reaction -- just keep narrating yourself accomplishing things for free until somebody says "okay, THAT you need a conflict to accomplish."<br/><br/>I guess what I'm asking is, what do you think that central, detached adversity role is actually providing?  Why does it have to be central?  Why does it have to be detached?

Yes, the Czege principle.  I'm not saying a PC will try to help himself out because it's also got some temporary narrative control of the adversity, but that, well, if that player plays his character and the adversity simultaneously, that falls under "talking to yourself," which is so not interesting to me.  When I look at, say, Polaris, my Heart could be involved in a scene when I'm the Mistaken, but he's just a side character for the current Heart.  I've seen that work, but I wouldn't try that as a main character here.<br/><br/>Central is also what I'm used to, but I'm fine trying other stuff.  Now, as I think about it, Central for this idea wouldn't be about some authority all in one place, as the players will have more authority in some places that average in the game, and less than average in others.  Central is about losing as few people to this support role of adversity - i.e. 1.  I'm not sure how to make that 0 without violating my sensibilities about "talking to yourself" <em>if</em> the characters are essentially joined at the hip.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76107/#Comment_76107" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T12:39:37+00:00" title="June 16, 2007 12:39PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>It might help to not think of the game as "GMless."

My mindset has drifted away from "this game has no GM" when I first started hearing about these games to "dude, everyone in this game gets to be the same sort of player."  "GM-less game" is also less wordy than "Games with distributed authority" or the like.<br/><br/>Thank you very much for the unpacking.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>There is no<i>inherent need</i>for a GM in a role-playing game.</blockquote>\nI agree with this in part, with the caveat that many games would require both a retooling of authority in their texts &amp; a complete retooling of the ingrained gamer subculture.  but I digress.<br/><br/>When I said that there was inherently more structure in a GM-less game, and the subsequent "Dude, Ryan, you're wrong" (also: thank you for everyone telling me I'm wrong here, it's very appreciated), I've come to think that we're been playing with this old, established widget called a GM for so long that we're just been told how to use it orally, not in any book.  You don't learn how to saw, hammer, drill, lathe, etc. from a book in woodshop class.  But GM-less is this totally new widget that no one can just say "Dude, it's a saw, just use it."  And every company makes a slightly different version of this widget, so you have to re-read each manual  for each new widget just in case they don't work the same.  Sure, every company making those old widgets does that same exact thing -- handsaw versus a chainsaw versus a jigsaw versus a bandsaw -- but they're all saws so we don't feel like we need much instruction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76111/#Comment_76111" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T13:25:16+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  1:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every company makes a totally different version of the widget, I'd say.

Furthermore, that also lead to us communicating what was and wasn't working with narrative transfer.<br/><br/>I didn't have any ritual phrases in the game until there was a point where we realized no one knew who was suppose to have narrative responsibility.  (I think I'm going to start saying "responsibility" rather than "control," which is what I'm used to saying &amp; thinking.)  Our ritual phrases grew out of play and changes a couple times because the transfer of responsibility was originally awkward.<br/><br/>This was made possible by you folks, for helping me understand the core &amp; language of distributed authority games.  There are still things I don't get, but this was my first non-GMed game that I've tried building so I suspect I'll get it more over time.  If any of ya'll are going to be at GenCon, I'd like to buy you a drink (alcohol optional).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76802/#Comment_76802" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T10:53:36+00:00" title="June 20, 2007 10:53AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I only drink in GM-less establishments, but if you're down with that, you're on!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_76804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76804/#Comment_76804" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-20T10:56:45+00:00" title="June 20, 2007 10:56AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>I only drink in GM-less establishments, but if you're down with that, you're on!</blockquote>\nIs this one of those hippie places where we have to duel for beverage control and bartender rights?<br/><br/>I'm in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
