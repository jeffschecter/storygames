                    So here's a little snippet of theory-thought that Thomas and I were throwing around:<br/><br/>The difference between Roleplaying Games and Board Games (and Card Games) lie in where the significant details come from.<br/><br/>In a Board Game (or Card Game) all the significant details are generated by specific procedures of the game -- a roll of the dice, drawing a card, the pieces on the board, or whatever.  The players make decisions <em>about</em> these significant details, but they do not <em>generate</em> these significant details.<br/><br/><code>&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt; I'm playing Pit.  I'm dealt cards.  I decide which cards to try to pass in order to collect a full hand.</code><br/><br/>In a Roleplaying Game, all (or most) of the significant details are generated by the players, and <em>manipulated</em> by the procedures of the game (a roll of the dice, a draw of a card).  Players then make decisions about the significant details that they have introduced, or more to the point, they make decisions about the significant details that the other players have introduced.<br/><br/><code>&lt;em&gt;Example:&lt;/em&gt; I'm playing Changeling.  I make a character, a pig pooka with broken wings, because I want to play a game regarding impossible dreams and the frustrations revolving around them.  In play, the dice inform how the story progresses and presents me with choices to make, but I make the choices.</code><br/><br/>Does that sound accurate to your experience?                </div>

                            Choice is a strange thing.  I think you could constrain all the choices save, say, one or two, and still have a "role-playing game".  Similarly, I have a friend (hi Steve) who enjoys adding an internal narrative to board games - he's sometimes easy to beat because he attaches value to individual units based on his private story.                        </div>

                            I'm not so much gunning for choice -- in fact, I think that's the red herring -- I'm after <em>input</em>, which is a slightly different thing.<br/><br/>In Pit, I don't get to decide that it's more important to sponsor grain industries that are friendly to the environment; all I get to do is collect the grain stocks that I can in order to corner the market one way or the other.  I still make <em>choices</em> -- wheat or barley -- but I don't make them <em>significant</em> -- the cards that I'm dealt do that.                        </div>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>Like I said on the blog, this is interesting stuff.  I was trying to think of the most extreme possible counter-example I could, and so I have to ask.  What about games like "mao" or "nomic" in which part of play is creating rules.  In those games the players are contributing significant elements.  Aren't they?<br/><br/>Likewise, isn't it fair to say that the rules of <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> contribute something significant when they require you to write up towns with The Progression (Pride, Injustice, etc.)?  Isn't it somehow significant that the rules of the game tell you not to do things some other way?  Not to tell some other sort of story?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas, I'm going to give you a cheese answer -- Mao and Nomic aren't Board Games or Card Games.  Perhaps they are some sort of Category Three Game?<br/><br/>The <em>DitV</em> sin progression does not dictate what sins go in it -- the "Pride" you start with can be any one of unlimited possibilities, and the developments from there are more shaped by the player input than they are the procedures that you follow.  However, I say this cross-eyed; I'm not totally sure of this.  A more moderate answer is that RPGs allow the players to generate <em>some, most, or all</em> of the significant details, while Board-n-Card games don't allow players to generate any.                        </div>

                            But that doesn't matter, Josh, the question here, really, is what defines a RPG, no? Otherwise why did you say board or card games? I could come up with a criteria about those that make them disparate categories as well. Like, in Card games there often are zero imaginative elements (people even forget that King means anything other than 12, effectively). <br/>
<br/>
I mean is this discussion really about the differences between "nomic-like" games (including Universalis, BTW) and board games?<br/>
<br/>
I've actually used a very similar definiton myself to set up a line of what's unique about RPGs. This is how I describe it. In non-RPGs, all decisions come down to a finite set of possible actions that a player can take based on the agreed to elements. Even in a Nomic game, where you can create new elements, you still make decisions on what happens based on the selected elements. In Nomic that list expands continually, and may become very large, but is never infinite. <br/>
<br/>
In RPGs, the assumption is reversed, and the in-game elements may do any of the infinite possible actions that they could do if they were real. The rules, then are set up to adjudicate what happens when things are attempted. <br/>
<br/>
And there are rules for everything in RPGs. Often the rule is, "It it's not a contentious sort of thing it just happens." Often followed by, "If you're not sure, then the GM just decides if it happens." But usually something like, "Then roll and compare the elements thusly, to see what happens. <br/>
<br/>
Now, looking at this, you can try to come up with counter-examples. Like in a miniatures game, you do really have an infinite number of moves you can make with a piece. But, in fact, all of these moves can be categorized into effective categories. Moving 9 inches or 9.5 inches may not matter if it's not to within firing range, or line of sight. Yes, with many units, this can rapidly mean a very high number of potential moves for any one unit (which I'd argue is one of the selling points of miniatures sans hexes), but it's till effectively finite. <br/>
<br/>
I think this is telling. Basically, in a non-rpg, you can nuance a move in play, but it doesn't make any difference to the outcome of play (other that, as in the example, players who are creating their own narrative on top of play - which I'd argue is playing an RPG simultanously or instead of the boardgame) per the rules. In a RPG, these nuances are often very important as adjudicated by the GM. <br/>
<br/>
I think this is key. In RPGs, there is some authority that gets to decide the outcome of every "maneuver." And they all *may* have an effect (though many don't). It's this responsibility to determine these things, instead of having a "hard" set of rules that pertains to only a finite set of maneuvers, that makes RPGs distinct from other sorts of games. <br/>

                            BTW, yes, this means that early dungeon crawl D&amp;D was not a RPG. Shouldn't be contentious, look at the covers of the games and at the text. Does it say Role-playing game anywhere? It doesn't. They say things like "Rules for Fantastic Miniatures Tabletop Gaming" and the like. <br/>
<br/>
You can also play a game like Hero System as a non-rpg, but games like that do have the opening for the "GM authority" to allow for infinite possibilites. Like the rules for "Special Effects" in Hero that says something like, "If a character uses a flame power to destroy paper, the GM may give some bonus dice to the damage" (and many other such rules). <br/>
<br/>
In fact, it may be the appearance of the "DM is last arbiter of what happens" rule in early D&amp;D that became RPGs. <br/>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>Let us not get into predestination vs. free choice, okay? <br/><br/>Other than that, I think the assumption may need some modifications for different styles of play (if they were real and the world they inhabited was real, as one easy example -- because the possible actions of the avatars of Shiva in a world of the dreams of fish are going to be pretty different than those of a bunch of Unknown Armies characters) -- but at the core I think it is at least pointing in a valid direction. <br/><br/>When I play Ticket to Ride I cannot convince anyone that I should be able to take the 3:19 from Toronto to Chicago. There is no 3:19 and there is no line from Toronto to Chicago -- despite whatever real life lines, story opportunities, dramatic potential, or whatever. <br/><br/>Change that to a game where we make up the SIS together, in whatever combination of power dynamics, and suddenly the possibility of the 3:19 to Chicago becomes something viable. It may not actually ever happen in the game, but it is something I could pitch and have some expectation that the idea will at least be entertained. <br/><br/>Same deal with the above mentioned Dogs town creation. Sure, there is a step by step system to follow, but you get to put whatever you want to in the system and can stop at any point you want based on the precise scientific formula of "when it feels right." Compare this to setting up a game of Mystery of the Abbey, in which you set up the board the same way when you play. You don't get to chose to stop drawing cards when it feels right, or to stop responding to the bell because it will make a better game. <br/><br/>RPGs have an element of chaos in them, as Thomas recently pointed out, because there is a degree of negotiated shared power to them that isn't present in many other games. Because of that the only places I found myself disagreeing with Mike is when he would say "GM" as the default for who gets to adjudicate -- and even then it was more of a niggle than anything else. (As you could say GM as a shorthand for "whatever combinations of people are responsible for the maintainance and adjudication of the fiction at this moment.")<br/><br/>The basic premise though, that I like a lot. In boardgames we are given a set of rules and then work out permutations therefrom. In RPGs we work out permutations, and then use a set of rules to decide which of them get credibility.                        </div>

<p>Brand, I'm asking if this is a false dichotomy - I strongly feel it is.</p>
<p>Because of things like <em>Apples to Apples, Once Upon a Time,</em> and <em>Waiting for the Queen/Tea at Midnight.</em></p>
<p>It's interesting to look at things from this angle, but there are too many counterexamples that fit tightly into their categories when you ask your intuition. To me that means there must be something amiss.</p>
<p><em>edit:</em> Or, put another way, this reminds me of GNS, which boils down to a set of categories too vague, overlapping, conflicting, and broad to be useful to anyone.</p>
<p>I also feel like there's a thread of ascribing this <em>cool thing</em> to roleplaying games because that's our thing, but there's a clear spectrum of <em>cool thing</em> use - take <em>Uno, OUaT,</em> (yes, again) and the <em>Roach</em>. Where do we draw the line? <em>Why</em> are you trying to draw a line?</p>

                            Joshua, as an interesting case for consideration, what about Scrabble? Scrabble's a board game and the significant details - the words - are generated by the players.<br/>
<br/>
Or how about Trivial Pursuit?<br/>

Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to screw your argument up. I'm trying to...no, wait, I am trying to screw your argument up, but in a good way.<br/>

                            Graham and Shreyas, <br/><br/>In both Once Upon a Time and Scrabble the stuff of the game comes first, and then you manipulate it to do something. <br/><br/>You have cards, or tiles, and then try to do something with them. The rules and the props of the game come before your input into the game and force, constrain, and shape the sum total of possible input you have into the game. <br/><br/>I haven't played Apples to Apples, so I can't comment there. But I can tell you that there is a pretty fundamental difference between the way everyone I know approaches OUAT and HeroQuest, for example. <br/><br/>HeroQuest, for the record, is a game that you totally have to play by Mike's definition. There is no game there except for the creation of the fiction and most HQ die hards have issues with the few fiddly bits remaining in the system. If you try and start with the game first and get the results from it afterwards you'll end up playing the bean counting game. OTOH, if you do the fictional stuff first and use the system to adjudicate it, you'll rock. <br/><br/>Shreyas alone, <br/><br/>The argument that "these things have some niggling details in areas where they get close to each other, so have no differentiation at all" doesn't hold any weight with me. I don't care how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. Certainly there are going to be games that straddle the line, and ones so close to a line that it can be hard to say where they fit with precision. Luckily we don't have to, as classifying each individual game into neat little Aristotelian logic boxes isn't the point. The point is to see if there is a way to give a reasoned and measured answer to a differentiation we are all already making anyway.                        </div>

<p>This isn't accurate to my experience of OUaT, which admittedly is not exactly something I have bothered to describe.</p>
<p>Anyway, my point isn't "What distinction are you trying to make?", because it's clear what <em>that</em> is; the question is, "What do you mean to do with it?" My question about whether the perceived distinction is real is related to that; given a goal, you can make cogent observations about whether different designs fulfill that goal. But without an application, it's impossible to know what anybody's talking about here.</p>

                            This is a good post and a good thread but as always I am marching at right angles to everyone else, tooting my horn and waving my banner and just trusting that there's someone behind me.<br/>
<br/>
I think certainly there is a distinction between application of rules and creation of anything (rules, a la Nomic, flavor text, a la the D&amp;D dungeon crawl, a town full of miscreants a la DitV).  Let me just add to that a little with my gaming group's experience with Once Upon A Time.<br/>
<br/>
My gaming group has 6 people, me and 5 others, 2 of whom were not around for this experiment. They are dead-set against narration-passing games, hate them, hate narrating, hate every part of contributing to the setting except through character (and character resource) design.  "If we wanted to do that," one said cogently, "we would GM."<br/>
<br/>
So myself and 3 others played a game of Once Upon a Time. Now, I enjoyed it greatly, I loved improvising the story, going along...this was actually a game I thought might be an interesting training instrument for people who have to do public speaking "on their feet" - salespeople, lawyers such as my ownself, publicists, reporters, etc.  You have to not only create a cogent storyline, and express it, but you have to angle it towards the concepts in your hand. <br/>
<br/>
In other words, you have to simultaneously manipulate things that are assigned to you by the impersonal laws of chance and design (the cards) and get your story to move along in some kind of coherent way. Get too incoherent and people will call you on it and you'll lose control of the narrative to someone else.<br/>
<br/>
I was good at this, my friend was good at this, my wife and her friend were terrible at this. They would get caught up in listening to the story and be unable to shift gears quickly enough to use their cards to interrupt the flow of it.  And once they got control of the story, often with a triumphant "HA!", they would be totally unable to think of where to go with it in order to get it to the next "fixed" point, i.e. one of their cards.<br/>
<br/>
So while I disagree that there's something special about card and board games that make them more prone to one kind of activity than RPGs are (Diplomacy. You lose.)  certainly there are two very different types of activity here, and it is a huge mistake to just decide that a potential player is equally good at both kinds of activity, or will equally enjoy both kinds. (There is often a big assumption floating around that all players, if properly exposed to the "right" kind of activity will always like it better, which is even worse than believing that all players will equally enjoy both sorts.)                        </div>

Would trying to identify how OUaT is a boardgame and Shab al-Hiri Roach is an RPG be niggling angels-on-the-head-of-a-pin stuff?<br/><br/>Because the difference in how the two work (from my understanding of the games) isn't too far apart. In fact, some aspects of the Roach are <em>closer</em> to boardgamey-ness than anything I know of in OUaT.                        </div>

                            Jason, <br/><br/>I've inner narratived Monopoly once or twice, mostly to keep my brain from dying in the really slow games... but it is possible. Mostly I do it in Diplomacy though. In fact, I don't know if I've ever played Diplomacy "straight" -- I'm always playing someone playing Diplomacy. <br/><br/>I also do it all the time in Betrayal at House on the Hill. Hell, in that game I often act out all of the things my character is doing, especially if I become the traitor. <br/><br/>Doesn't change anything about the game though.<br/><br/>Shreyas, <br/><br/>Because discussions have to start somewhere? Really, insisting that we start talking about how we're going to design to this while we're still talking about what we mean by "this" is silly. I agree that the real worth of it will come once we get to the point where the rubber hits the road, but until you have some backgrounding and terms in place for the community to use to talk about it, you're either going to be doing it alone or just be incoherent. <br/><br/>As for why try to draw a line? So we can design to it, so we can understand it, so we can not get trapped in things we think we understand but don't because we've never bothered to think about them? To figure out why some people like one kind of activity and not the other so we can better support them in whichever they want to do? I love boardgames about as much as I love RPGs, and there is no "RPGs are cool and those games aren't" going on in me, at the least. And really, I'm wondering where that constant complaint in every thread that dares to speculate that there are different issues going on in different games comes from. <br/><br/>Though, now that you bring it up, I'd really like to hear about your experience with OUaT. If you don't want to do it here, email me or something. We should chat about that, as I love that game a lot. Maybe we could get some useful grist out of that? <br/><br/><br/>JD, <br/><br/>I'm actually having trouble finding a place where we disagree. Certainly I agree with the statement "certainly there are two very different types of activity here, and it is a huge mistake to just decide that a potential player is equally good at both kinds of activity, or will equally enjoy both kinds. (There is often a big assumption floating around that all players, if properly exposed to the "right" kind of activity will always like it better, which is even worse than believing that all players will equally enjoy both sorts.)" about 5000%.<br/><br/>So, um, can you tell me where I was wrong earlier? <br/><br/>Linnaeus, <br/><br/>I don't know that I'd say that OUaT is a boardgame. I'd say its not an RPG, and is right on the shadey boarder of being a Story game in the sense of the word used when Andy titled this community. <br/><br/>Plus, boardgame-itus and parlor narration games has been a topic that's been going around recently, so it may be worth some talk about what happens when the issues of who creates what and when become too constrained and end up moving a game from one type of activity to another. For some examples of where I'm coming with this, it is probably worth looking up Ben's reviews of some of this years Iron Game Chef games. <br/><br/>Or, to make it easier (as there are a lot of posts to look through), it's when you get statements like this: <br/><br/><code>The third, and largest problem, is that this is fundamentally broken as a role-playing game. The mechanics have no effect on the fiction at all, nor is there any room for anything but playing out the cold equations of the dice game. "Play a dice game, and maybe talk a little bit about a story while you do it" is simply not interesting as a role-playing exercise. Although it can be fun as a dice-game, in this case, the game fails on that count as well (see above.) &lt;a href=http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=773&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code><br/><br/>Coupled with<br/><br/><code>Basically, one of the core problems with this game for the purposes of this contest is that it is has succumbed to "board game-itis," a disease which frequently strikes 24-hour and Chef Games, particularly those that are Forge inspired. Basically, this game is a rather simple, mostly luck based dice game, with some narration attached. The fictional elements are totally disconnected from the mechanical elements, to the point where I'm really hard-pressed to see where they related. &lt;a href="http://www.1km1kt.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=743"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;</code><br/><br/>That you start seeing a lack of clarity about the divisions of "type of activity" between RPGs and boardgames and the ways in which they interact with player creation and mechanical interaction. The funny thing about it is that when you do these types of things and blur the lines on purpouse it often works out well (OUaT being a good example), but if you stumble into it it usally bites you on the butt. It's all to easy to end up with something that could have been a good RPG or a good boardgame, but isn't a very good anything because its stuck in the middle. <br/><br/>(Alas, I've not yet read the Roach, so can't comment there.)                        </div>

                            The Nomic comparison intrigues me because, in many ways, the whole question of the application and expansion of the rules in Nomic strike mas as having a fairly close relationship to the expansion and application of the rules in a rpg...I'm not quite sure where to run with that.  My temptation is to talk of Nomic as a metagame and rpg's as a peculiar version of that 'style'...I best read over Nomic again before going to far on that track.<br/>
<br/>
I do like this talk of input--it does seem like my best rpg experiences have been ones where things changed dramatically based on player choice and not just player rolling.  At least part of this seems to rest on the way in which players can 'interpret' those roles--sure, my character fails, but I decide that failure sends him off on a long quest to make himself worthy, and boom, the whole backdrop shifts to accomodate it.<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons I have often been dissatisfied with D&amp;D styled modules rests on this problem: too often, they don't enable much interpretation and, to be used, require the GM shut down that interpretation, contain it, in order to keep using the module.  As a player, I actually start finding myself doing what Jason describe Steve doing: telling a story about what is going on in my character's head, that may very well get them killed--'allow' the GM to 'beat' me because I'm no longer playing quite 'on the board.'                        </div>

                            Don't you love it when you start a thread and then don't watch it for a couple days and you come back to it and it turns out everybody took it and ran with it?  This is all great stuff, guys.<br/><br/><strong>Isbo</strong> -- I agree with you there somewhat, but remember that in D&amp;D, the GM is still one of the players, so the content is still coming from a person rather than the rules.  The thing of it is, when the GM shuts everybody else down, he's hogging all the RPG-fun of contributing content; the other players don't get to do the fun RPG-thing, even though it's happening <em>right in front of their faces</em>.<br/><br/><strong>Mike</strong> (a way up there) -- I don't buy the "RPG as reproduction of the real world" argument.  Superficially, it seems to describe what's happening at the table, but on scrutiny, it doesn't.  RPGs are far more about the people interacting and telling each other bits of stories and amusing each other than reproducing what different things a given fictional person can do with a given fictional object.  A lot of the rest of your post I agree with, but I think that founding the distinction in the simulative qualities of an RPG is a red herring.  Which means that I mostly agree with Shreyas.<br/><br/><strong>Shreyas</strong> -- There's totally games that sit on the divide.  There's probably games-as-written that inspire games-being-played of both flavors (I play one game as a board game, you play it as an RPG).  Diplomacy, as JD points out, is a great example.  You can play it out as simple strategy, or you can decide to <em>be</em> the Sultan of Turkey and not invade France as long as they promise you a shipload of their women.  Just like, say, Republicans and Democrats, though, despite the fact that there are individuals that straddle the line, there's still some worth in talking about what the two ends of the spectrum are like.  Not to mention, the better we understand the distinction, the better equipped we'll be to design games that sit right there on the line.<br/><br/><strong>Brand</strong> -- <em>Once Upon a Time</em> is totally a Board (Card) Game.  You're dealt story elements.  What you do from there on out is inspired and constrained by those cards (in fact if you don't play a card for too long you lose narration).  It's exactly the same as being dealt a hand in poker -- everything you do from then on out is about the cards and what further cards you draw.  All of the significant details come from your hand of cards.                        </div>

                            Imagine I pick up a copy of Monopoly and start playing with my friends. Imagine then that I decide to base my strategy not on the objective goals of the game, bankrupting all my opponents, but instead create an avatar or my playing piece and their goals: 'My father was cheated of his true inheritance of the railways, and I his son will win them back for him'. The system doesn't support my victory conditions, but it does possess support for an avenue for me to pursue it - the acquisition of property.  My fellow players might enjoy my in-character scheming and actually try to support or hinder my goals. They might cheer or boo if I achieve my victory conditions, even they are not those outlined by the game. Am I roleplaying? Will they get upset if I try to end the game claiming I have now won, when the established victory conditions have not been fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Mike that early D&amp;D play iwth its emphasis on the dungeon similarly failed to promote achieving my character goals over gaining new character levels. How different was it to a game of Talisman at the time, apart from the detail of the resolution. If I had a goal like 'Take my rightful position on the throne' it was unlikely to be fulfilled in the game as played, and even as interesting back-story was probably never reflected in play.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience it was only later that role-playing came to use the fact that the play experience was not limited to one type of adventure, but open-ended enough for the the character's goals or back-story to mean something, and system support has been a long time coming. <br/>
<br/>
My  own experience was that the push came from non-fantasy rpgs where the dungeon paradigm could not be sustained and play had to look in other directions. Perhaps that's wrong.<br/>
<br/>
This makes a role-playing game can be difficult to pin-down as for much of its history the act of role-playing was a convention that existed outside of the text as much as within it.                        </div>

<i>I agree with you there somewhat, but remember that in D&amp;D, the GM is still one of the players, so the content is still coming from a person rather than the rules. </i><br/><br/>That is actually why I specified the module format--I play a lot of D&amp;D, which isn't necessarily 'module' driven.  Once a module gets out, though, it *isn't* the DM supplying the content--it is the DM adjudicating the content.  In this case, they seem very, very close to tactical games where you go here and there, and if you go somewhere else, the DM has to either abandon the module or rail you back in.   <br/><br/>Even if the DM *designs* the module, in play it doesn't function any differently than a published module--you go here or there, but over there, the world might as well not exist.  If I created the monopoly game, it would still be a boardgame when I ran a game of it.<br/><br/>Which is to say, that I think the question of input could be clarified--in rpg's, interpretations made *during* play can entirely change the game's direction.                        </div>

                            My feelings lately have been that RPGs are games in which the color created by the players provides additional constraint on later player options.<br/><br/>A lot of the games I reviewed for IGC felt like "parlor narration" games. I had to get it straight in my mind what they were missing that made me feel they weren't really RPGs. It was that the color was ignorable.

<p>I get the impression, from usage, that it means "narration doesn't affect the game's mechanics" but that's simply impossible.</p>

                            It's a little condesending, yeah.  Basically it's a game setup where you roll dice or pull cards or whatever and the game tells you what happens, which you then narrate.  There's little to no <em>choice</em> involved -- you don't do something because you choose to do it, you do it because that's what the game told you to do.<br/><br/>Imagine if you were playing Candyland, but narrating your progress towards the... whatever, Candy Castle or whatever's at the end.  While the narration may affect the overall experience, it doesn't affect the actual progress across the board.                        </div>

                            Meh.  In my mind, at least, it's derivative of the many Victorian-era parlor games which operated in much the same way.  The game functions as a convenient social nexus -- the operation of the game is secondary to the socialization of the players around it.                        </div>

                            Adam--I think we are saying something very similar; I even toyed with bringing out the parlor narration talk.  I want to say it is something more than color at stake, although that may be because I don't have as robust a notion of color as you do--you may mean more by it than I do.<br/>
<br/>
One curiosity: parlor narration seems to be one of those boundary situations where a game rests precariously between 'rpg' and 'board game.'  Parlor narration invites you to engage in some of the rpg elements without the usual mechanical elements that let you really *play* that role.<br/>
<br/>
An idea: the 'role' of rpg serves as a frame for the player, a tool through which they can invoke an interpretation of the world.  Usually, it comes with a number of mechanical supports that enable it to achieve this goal, usually one of those being a certain freedom the player has to 'move' the frame around in the setting, go here and there, interact.  Board games really don't have that--the board is laid out in front of you, what you see is what you get.  If you don't see it, it isn't there.<br/>
<br/>
Now, a 'parlor narration' invokes the window without the mechanics to allow the player to do much with it.  They can look and respond but not really move it.  There is a 'tragic' direction to it--tragic in the sense that the window gives a certain sense of necessity to what unfolds (tragedy is more than just necessity, but I find necessity alone begins to feel a little tragic).  It may have a few end conditions but nothing but those end conditions can be achieved.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if this is innately bad, but it does create a very particular kind of play experience.  It can be very rpg-like in the right situations (players embrace it and basically go fiddling and dancing to their end, seeing what happens along the way) or very board game-like (players don't really get into the roles and just play the game out as an exercise in strategy or rote dice throwing).  I suspect the way in which the game presents itself might have much to do with whether someone considers it RPG or board game...                        </div>

<p>So, then, pn games necessarily can't contain decisions, since I can always generate details that are significant because they reveal things about my own decisionmaking process, right?</p>

How much signifigance must be generated for it to be a roleplaying game?  If you only get a single choice to make in a four hour session, does that qualify?

                            On parlor narration:<br/>
<br/>
I actually like the term quite a bit and I think it ought to be broadened a bit, partially because it does a nice job of capturing a nifty zone where a board game and rpg interests meet.  I don't like using it as a derogatory descriptor, although I realize I am being contrarian in this regard.  It also does another cool thing: it allows us to claim a broader set of models for 'story games' and what can be done with them.  Although I have not examined it closely, Bachhanal strikes me as a parlor narration style game which is, simultaneously, a story game with rpg elements.<br/>
<br/>
I think some 'parlor narration' games are, in fact, fun and enjoyable on their own.  They only become problematic when someone tries to do something with them that they were never built to do, then they are approached as 'failing' to do something for which they weren't designed.  They also make a good 'gateway drug' for novices to get into other, more open story-rpg games.  They seem manageable and easy to get a handle on.<br/>
<br/>
Adam--you mentioned that a lot of Game Chef entries were parlor narration--is this in general or just this year?  If it refers to this year's contest, I'll tender a hypothesis: parlor narration tends to be most closely associated with games that have a time limit.  Why?  Because the easiest and most intuitively satisfying way of creating a time limit involves establishing clear start and finish conditions.  Once you have defined end points and a limited amount of time, you start getting some pretty clear and discrete permutations of play.                        </div>

                            My entry this year is, as it stands, a parlor narration game (Terra Nova).  My Ronnies entry Xochitlcozamalatl, too.  Time pressure encourages concrete parameters of play, I suspect, even if the game itself isn't time-delimited.                        </div>

<em>Josh, who decides what is significant? How much signifigance must be generated for it to be a roleplaying game? If you only get a single choice to make in a four hour session, does that qualify? What if the only detail you create is how you fail?</em><br/><br/>I define "significant," at least in terms of roleplaying games, as addressing the game's premise.  In parallel, a good definition of "significant" is that it influences or inspires later developments in play.  So the half-hour talk with the barmaid that goes nowhere and has nothing to do with the rest of the game? (Which you might insert, for reasons unknown, into a game of Talisman or something.)  Insignificant.  On the other hand, the half-hour talk with the barmaid that (a) ties into some development later and/or (b) allows a player to address the premise -- that's significant stuff.<br/><br/>So prime among all other concerns is defining a game's premise -- which can be different for different players, and thus any given detail might be significant by one player's perspective and insignificant according to another.  In fact I suspect a lot of play runs along these lines.  Once you get into games where the premise is provided by the text or games that guide the players to create premise together, you can get a lot more games where my significant detail is your significant detail, and we're sharing and collaborating in a much more profound way.<br/><br/>(Yes, you can take any board game on the planet and roleplay through it, but unless that roleplay is significant -- addresses premise or constrains later play -- you're not quite playing a <em>roleplaying game</em>.)<br/><br/>As we started off the thread, I clarified that I'm not talking about choice, I'm talking about input.  So let me rephrase your last two questions:<br/><br/>"If you only get a single input in a four hour session, does that qualify?  What if the only detail you create is how you fail?"<br/><br/>Assuming that you are okay with only having a single significant input in four hours of play (after all, I can play lots of board games where I have no significant input whatsoever and enjoy myself), what you've got is, simply, a roleplaying game that you're not having much significant input in.  Something like a railroaded illusionist game -- which, whether or not you find that fun or desireable, I think it still qualifies as a roleplaying game.<br/><br/>If all you're contributing is your failures... I mean, we're talking about Death Stakes now, yes?  I think that's pretty profoundly a roleplaying game -- all you do is contribute significant details -- constrained into a theme of your own grizzly death, sure, but there are few things more significant than an intentional death scene.                        </div>

                            Ian, I was referring to a handful of IGC entries that I judged or otherwise got to read this year. Not all of them this year and certainly not all of them in all years. A fair number of the Ronnies entries got nailed as parlor narration games, and I didn't <i>get it</i> till I was judging games myself and kept thinking, "But this isn't a role-playing game."<br/><br/>This is one of those threads that would seriously benefit from some Actual Play examples for elucidation.<br/><br/>Have you ever played Talisman, the board game? It has all the trappings of an RPG. You have a character (and a cute little cardboard standup figure to move around the board). Your character has gear and stuff. You roll dice, choose which way to move around the board, occasionally go on side trips to dungeons or the astral plane, fight things (and roll dice), kill them, and take their stuff. You even level up, if I recall correctly. Sounds like D&amp;D, no?<br/><br/>It's not a role-playing game. It's a board game. Even if you totally role-play your character as you go -- and I often did when I played -- it isn't a RPG. Nothing in the System draws a line of causality between the stuff you introduce during role-playing and anything else that happens in the game. <br/><br/>Partly, the very limited scope of player actions is to blame. You can't decide to spurn the goblin and thus cause him to go home to his father the goblin king in tears. It's just not an action that can occur within the rules. You kill him or he kills you. <br/><br/>There's this notion of the fiction having its own rules that everyone around the table seems to understand implicitly (or with a little bit of discussion when something odd comes up). <br/><br/>[Warning: The following is all my conjecture based on my limited understanding of D&amp;D before the Erol Otis red-box set that I started playing in 1980. I've studied the rules and history of the game prior to that, but it's not the same as being there. I could be totally full of shit.]<br/><br/>Really, what was original D&amp;D compared to its wargame ancestors, but the insertion of My Guy into that space plus the idea that the world had predictable causality? The "My Guy" thing basically got everyone into the head of a character and suddenly <i>the causality of personal actions</i> became important.<br/><br/>When playing Chainmail, you might taunt the other player in the voice of your warlord, but it didn't really mean anything in game terms. It might make the player do something rash out of frustration but that's a metagame thing, theoretically. When playing D&amp;D, when your Fighter Lord mocked the opposing warlord, it could have in-game consequences. There might not even be rules for it, but the players around the table were willing, for the first time ever, to consider letting it change the world.<br/><br/>How cool!  And how the fuck did that come about?                        </div>

                            But hang on. have I missed something? Where do board games fit into all this now? <br/><br/>At the start of this thread, we were talking about differences between roleplaying games and board games. That's something I'm interested in: not because I think we'll succeed in finding the difference but because it's interesting to try.<br/><br/>Now we're saying things like:
<blockquote>I define "significant," at least in terms of roleplaying games, as addressing the game's premise.</blockquote>
But surely the existence of a premise <i>defines</i> it as a roleplaying game in the first place? If we want to decide whether Game X is a board game or roleplaying game, we can't start by saying "Well, is the premise addressed?", because board games don't have a premise.<br/><br/>Likewise, if we're saying things like:
<blockquote>If you only get a single choice to make in a four hour session, does that qualify?</blockquote>
...it doesn't help much with board games, because board games have loads of choices, just not of the "roleplaying" sort.<br/><br/>Seriously, help me out: did I miss part of the argument?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Like all forum monsters, Graham, it's morphed and transformed into something bigger and uglier.  I'll try and tie bits together:<br/><br/>Both boardgames and roleplaying games have premises -- the premise of Monopoly is something akin to "Clever investing makes you rich" while a premise of a game of Capes is "Power is fun, but do you deserve it?"  Through the course of play, that premise will be addressed (via significant details).  The question is whether it will be addressed in ways proscribed by the game mechanics (I got rich because you landed on Park Place, which I'd invested in) or addressed by the players themselves (I prove I deserve my superpowers because I comforted Katey after rescuing her from the badguy).<br/><br/>No matter what I do in Monopoly, I cannot address the premise in any way other than how the game mechanics address the premise.  I cannot show that you have to be charming in order to get those investment opportunities -- the only way you ever get those opportunities is by landing on its square (or it's auctioned off).<br/><br/>Contrariwise, if I don't do anything in my play in Capes to address the premise, the game falls flat, and in Capes' case, I accrue Debt until everything I touch fails.<br/><br/>The question is <em>not</em> about choice -- both board games and roleplaying games have lots and lots of choices.  The question is whether those choices generate significant details (ie addressing premise) or whether they are reactions or expressions of significant details generated by the game rules.<br/><br/>Any clearer?                        </div>

                            All this talk of addressing premise focuses only on one creative agenda. Are you only interested in the difference between board games and Narrativist RPGs?<br/><br/>If you broaden the discussion to include Gamist games, for example, you have to look at how choices generate significant details for Step On Up and so on.                        </div>

                            That really is clearer, yes. <br/><br/>For a moment, it looked as though we were treating board games as purely mechanical activities, where the players effectively made no choices at all (as in Snakes and Ladders). <br/><br/>So, let me see if I can paraphrase this right: board games do involve player choices, but those choices are all game-mechanical choices. Roleplaying games <i>can</i> involve game-mechanical choices but will <i>also</i> involve choices that don't stem from the mechanics. <br/><br/>Is that a good paraphrase or did I just mangle your idea?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Adam, all of the above applies to Gamist and Simulationist premises, as well.<br/><br/>In a Simmy game, where the premise is something like "Explore the world and cultures of Azeroth" I have input when I juxtapose different elements of the setting to introduce problems or solutions to those problems.<br/><br/>In a Gamish game, where the premise is something like "Outmaneuver the forces of Creation to ascend to incredible power" I have input when I approach a situation in a particular way to accomplish my goals.<br/><br/>I can't do either of those when I'm playing Monopoly.  I have to roll dice, and then I have to buy the property, auction the property, or pay rent.  Even when I buy up hotels on a specific strip, I'm not generating significant details; I'm not saying anything about the importance or nature or worth of hotels.  They're just red plastic things that make you pay more when you land there.<br/><br/>Graham --<br/><br/>Close enough for hand grenades, I think.  When you say "game mechanics" I think you mean <em>merely</em> game mechanics, and when you say "not game mechanics" I think you mean stuff that the player decides is important.  Is that correct?

<i> I have input when I juxtapose different elements of the setting to introduce problems or solutions to those problems.<br/>I have input when I approach a situation in a particular way to accomplish my goals.</i><br/><br/>Ok, I played Dungeoneer, the card game, for the first time this weekend.  Quick summary: everyone plays a character moving through a dungeon, lays down cards to build the dungeon, and sends monsters after other heroes.  My 'goal' is to complete three quests.  I have all kinds of input in that--how I place cards on the table, who and what critters/traps I send my opponents' way, whether I focus on my personal quests or complete the 'public' quests.  Juxtaposing elements? Yes.  Input into how I approach the solution to a problem? Yes.  Are they significant?  Yes, very.<br/><br/>That being said, it didn't feel like an rpg in any way.  It was a fun card game, although I had 'flashes' of stories I *could* tell over the course of play.  Input alone does not do it.  It's why I like the talk of the frame and its capacity to be modified.  It's why parlor narration is interesting--if Dungeoneer had a framing mechanic, could it be a fun rpg experience?  Sure, you have to respond to the cards you draw, to the ones you have in your hand, but there is a lot of flexibility in that.  It's why I don't see parlor narration as tangential to a discussion of the difference between board-card games and rp games.  Parlor narration invokes the frame that is, to me, an essential component to a rpg experience.  <br/><br/>In other words: if I *just* add narration to a game, how close to a rpg does it get?  How much more needs to be added to make it not *just* a story I tell parallel to what the mechanics tell me must happen?<br/><br/>The degree to which it is able to do more than just 'open a window' into the setting has a lot to do with how much fun gets had on the rp front.                        </div>

<i>are you creating the significant details that forward the game, or are you manipulating the significant details that are provided (both in card content and rules permutations) by the game?</i><br/><br/>The problem is that 'manipulation' and 'creation' get kind of mucky--do I 'create' a dragon when I run a game of D&amp;D or just manipulate the pieces the game provides me (a setting, a list of monsters, character generation)?  When a player decides to rally an army to hunt the dragon, are they creating that detail or just manipulating features of the setting?  <br/><br/>In Dungeoneer, am I just manipulating cards or *creating* the significant detail of where a room is--when where that room is will directly impact what I and my fellow players will have to do to play the game?  When it's location is a siginificant detail that does not exist until I lay the card down?                        </div>
