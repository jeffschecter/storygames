                    I'm thinking about whether it's possible to share the code for the Breaking The Ice engine. I'd really welcome some opinions.<br/><br/>Firstly, the game itself is Emily's, not mine. So, although I'd like to share the code, I don't want to risk anyone stealing the whole game and (say) charging for access to it. That said, I would like to share some of the code, in the hope that it'll spawn other online things.<br/><br/>One option is Creative Commons, of course. But I'm increasingly frustrated by Creative Commons these days: both by the license itself and its ubiquity. <br/><br/>For example: while writing this code, I needed pictures of dice. So I went to Wikimedia Commons and what did I find? Loads of pictures of dice, <i>all with bloody GNU and CC licenses</i>. If I used those pictures and later decided I wanted to do something commercial with the code, I'd have to either a. replace all the images or b. negotiate with loads of artists. Vastly irritating and I don't want to put other people through that.<br/><br/>So another option is something that allows commercial use: say, Public Domain or a CC-Attribution license. <br/><br/>Now, that's tempting. I'd like people to use the code for their own projects, commercial or not. But, as I said above, I don't want Matchmaker.com stealing the whole bloody thing, without altering it, and putting it on their site. <br/><br/>So then the third option is standard copyright: just publish the code and let people get in touch if they'd like to use it. That's tempting. I like the idea of people talking about projects.<br/><br/>My feeling, at the moment,  is that I'd like to share certain parts of the game as public domain: say, all the images, the user management bit and the include files (which have the useful utility functions). Then the rest (including everything with <i>the game</i> itself) would be standard copyright, with a Ben Lehman-esque note saying "We're keen for people to use this, so get in touch". (Of course, this isn't my decision alone, but those are some initial thoughts).<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't know. What do you think? Have I missed any interesting ideas for sharing the code? I don't want a big legalistic discussion: what I'd really like is for people to say "Graham, you're wrong about Creative Commons, and here's why it's great". Stuff like that.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            First of all, I'd have a conversation with Emily, who no doubt has some good ideas and maybe concerns of her own about how this propogates.<br/><br/>If the images are all that are holding you up, let's get you some free-and-clear images.  I know an artist or two, for Pete's sake.    <br/><br/>I can understand your concern over dodgy appropriation.  Your proposed model for sharing some useful bits but retaining clear rights to the core makes sense to me.  I'm obviously a fan of CC licensing but I'm not going to be a zealot about it, particularly about electronic content, which I don't know much about.                        </div>

                            I agree with Jason heartily on talking to Emily.<br/><br/>I think your "at the moment" feeling is probably pretty solid.  Have you considered releasing the user management parts and the include files under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html" rel="nofollow">LGPL</a>?<br/><br/>Also, you didn't specify what kind of CC licenses the images you found were under.  If all you found were BY-NC, or Attribution-Noncommercial, I can understand your frustration.  But no NoDerivs license would prevent you from later doing commercial things with your code, as long as you specified somewhere how the individual images were licensed.  A Sharealike license would require you to make your code SA as well, but that doesn't prevent you from selling it (whether it would reduce your potential buyers is a different matter).<br/><br/>Finally, the Wikimedia Commons is probably not the best place for you if you're looking for non-CC and -GNU stuff.  Consider a free stock imagery site like <a href="http://www.sxc.hu/" rel="nofollow">stock.xchng</a>, which has loads of stuff that's free to use under conditions that are much weaker than the other licenses.  Consider also searching <a href="http://creativecommons.org/image/" rel="nofollow">the Creative Commons site itself</a>, and checking both boxes to ensure you get useful (BY-only) results.                        </div>

...well, of <i>course</i>, that goes without saying. I just wanted to see which options were out there.<br/><br/>I'd very much welcome any other ideas, comments or criticism.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            First, regarding GPL/CC licenses.  They're just that: licenses, and both are expressly non-exclusive.  The original author retains the copyright and can license the works separately to you.  Or, contrariwise, you can license the work separately otherwise.  By using a CC deed or the GPL, you can limit general use, and still include a "I'm willing to work something out."  The only real restriction is that you couldn't grant an exclusive license to a purchaser - but you probably don't want that anyway.<br/><br/>Secondly, I'd be willing to put together some dice icons, if you're interested.  I wouldn't call myself and artist, per se, but seeing your icons as an example, I could knock you up something decent.  (See: <a href="http://www.highwatergames.com/logo.png" rel="nofollow">here</a> to see if you think the quality of work is acceptable.)                        </div>

                            I needed some dice images and went to <a href="http://www.openclipart.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.openclipart.org/</a> and searched. Found some 2-D ones, which were all I wanted, public domain. There's lots of good stuff there, but the search isn't very sophisticated (it just uses Google).                        </div>
