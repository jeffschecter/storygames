Tell me if I'm out of line here.<br/><br/>Anyway.My sister and I have been talking about playing the old classic Heroes of Might and Magic III over the internet together, but I'm thinking maybe there is something that better suits us.<br/><br/>What she is into in HoMM is collecting stuff, building stuff, improving your hero and fighting creep. She is not as interested in taking enemy cities and vanquishing other players, though she appreciates that there is a clear and reachable goal.<br/><br/>I want something I can run on my netbook, something you can play sessions of when you feel like it, something which doesn't demand huge tactical immersion but I don't mind if it allows for it. Something casual that still has the potential to grab you and immerse you, in the same way as the HoMM games does. <br/><br/>I'm thinking something like cooperative tactical squad-crpg:s or something. What do you think?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_273635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/273635/#Comment_273635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-30T03:56:04+00:00" title="May 30, 2010  3:56AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want something like HoMM then take a look at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciples_II:_Dark_Prophecy" rel="nofollow">Disciples</a>.

In HoMM online, I only see my moves, what the other player does doesn't really concern me. I want a game we can experience <i>together</i> <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Icewind Dale and other straight RPGs could definitly work, but it sort of requires you to sit out the entire campaign, right? I'd like something a little more casual, something you can play once in a while in a spare afternoon, without keeping notes on the storyline.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
