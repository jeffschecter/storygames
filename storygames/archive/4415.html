Go Play SE Portland <a href="/forums/search?Search=%237&amp;Mode=like">#7</a> is on Sat, October 6th. I just wanted to make sure that everyone who lived in the portland area knows that they are invited. You can find all the details on our <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/pdxindiegames" rel="nofollow">Live Journal</a>.<br/><br/>GPSEPDX is a small monthly game night and community dinner hosted by myself and Charles Seaton at our house in SE Portland. In the past we've facilitated up to 3 games and 19 guests. This time we're going for four games. Games on the menu include Polaris, Dust devils, Shock, TSOY, Beast Hunters and Project CHAIR.<br/><br/>Consider this an open invitation. Feel free to email me for more info or directions.<br/><br/>Hope to see you there!<br/><br/>Jake<br/>jake@atarashigames.com                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
