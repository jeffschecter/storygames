I have a player with a personal goal that's tangential to the group's and I don't really want to give it a lot of screen time (the player feels the same way FYI) for practical reasons.  We also don't have the time to meet and do some 1 on 1 sessions so that is out.<br/><br/>Should I distill his actions to a single roll to resolve the conflict?  Lay out the stakes (via email) and then roll the dice?  Have you ever done anything like this, did it work?<br/><br/>Also, if the system has a reward system which gives bennies for pursuing your goals - should the player receive one for actions that happen away from the table?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331942">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alejandro_Etsu" title="Alejandro_Etsu"><img alt="Alejandro_Etsu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i28.tinypic.com/2uqiyv8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alejandro_Etsu">Alejandro_Etsu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331942/#Comment_331942" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T14:51:39+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  2:51PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 27, 2011 2:55PM by Alejandro_Etsu.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What game are we talking about?<br/><br/>It is perfectly valid that this character can be the protagonist during a session, and the rest of the characters are his supporting characters. Otherwise, maybe the player should change his goal to something more appropriate to the situation at hand.

Just have two parallel stories and cut between them: first story, the PC is off doing their own thing in secret; second story, the other PCs are a) possibly finding out what the first PC is doing, which they won't agree with and/or b) engaging in the main group goal but minus the crucial first PC, causing complications for the group.<br/><br/>I mean there are lots of 'ensemble of spies/monster hunters/badasses' TV shows that eventually have shows like this. It's all about playing up the drama of the one PC having goals that are, if not directly at odds, then independant/orthogonal to the main goal of the group. This seems especially interesting since the other PCs don't agree with the goal -- how will they react when their friend/ally/colleague ditches to go do this thing? Will they find out? Will they blame them if something goes wrong while they are busy? Etc.<br/><br/>Leaving that aside to go back to the original question; if there's really no interest in playing it out, then I don't see why not. You could make it as simple or complicated as you want, mechanically, since arranging a series of rolls via email is not significantly harder than arranging a single roll. My feeling is that allowing the player to gain the 'benny' might set an unfortunate precedent, though. <br/><br/>But I mean it really depends on why you are resolving it off-screen, instead of leaving it unresolved until it can come up in play -- is it because the player feels like they need to know how it is resolved to continue playing forward with their character? Is it because it seems unreasonable that they keep putting it off, in the fiction?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331980/#Comment_331980" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T18:39:43+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  6:39PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not try this?<br/><br/>1.
