It's got to be in the 1930s.<br/><br/>If we put the apocalypse after March 1st, 1936, then we've got the Hoover Dam. That's a wonderful thing, because it's one of the few power-generators that will keep running after an apocalypse. So we can have Las Vegas in the middle of a postapocalyptic wasteland, fully lit.<br/><br/>If we put it before December 11th, 1936, then King Edward VIII never abdicates. This is an interesting thing in the United Kingdom: Edward VIII was only king for a year, before abdicating to marry an American woman. So, if we time it right, he stays king throughout the postapocalyptic game.<br/><br/>What other interesting dates have we got? What I'm really looking for an equivalent to that Edward VIII thing, but for the United States. When can I end the world to make things interesting? Can we get a President Landon or something equally fun?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252581/#Comment_252581" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-25T11:23:09+00:00" title="January 25, 2010 11:23AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FDR is president throughout the whole of the 1930s.

This treatise of the particle beam is currently in the Nikola Tesla Museum archive in Belgrade. It described an open ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allowed particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing nondispersive particle streams (through electrostatic repulsion).[86]<br/><br/>His records indicate that it was based on a narrow stream of atomic clusters of liquid mercury or tungsten accelerated via high voltage (by means akin to his magnifying transformer). Tesla gave the following description concerning the particle gun's operation:<br/><br/>    [The nozzle would] send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.[87]<br/><br/>The weapon could be used against ground based infantry or for antiaircraft purposes.[88] Tesla tried to interest the US War Department in the device.[89] He also offered this invention to European countries.[90] None of the governments purchased a contract to build the device.

He asserted, not that our minds could not conceivably have had the power of penetrating beyond the phenomenal world, but merely that they were in fact devoid of it. And this leads the critic to ask how, if it is possible to know only what lies within the bounds of sense-experience, the author can be justified in asserting that real things do exist beyond, and how he can tell what are the boundaries beyond which the human understanding may not venture, unless he succeeds in passing them himself.</blockquote>\nEdit 3: Jan 1936, Lovecraft writes his last story?

This morning I went to Mrs. Townsend's Wednesday morning musical at which Mr. Schelling and his string quartet played. My guests were two ladies from the Diplomatic Corps, and two wives of members of the Cabinet.<br/><br/>We sat down and I had almost forgotten that there was such a thing as a cough. With the opening bars of the music, the wife of the Mexican Ambassador began to cough and tried to stifle it and then she and I kept up a duet. We were horribly embarrassed, and I became acutely anxious between the gasps of the annoyed glances from neighboring boxes. I found myself choking as children do with whooping cough in my efforts to keep quiet. I should have left the hall, but I knew that would probably create a sensation. Mrs. Hull handed me a little box of lozenges and whispered that she always had them with her because they were made in Nashville, Tennessee! Madame de Castillo Najera and I each took one and gradually our coughs ceased. All was quiet during the entr'acte. I talked easily and had no desire to cough. The lights went out, the music began and with it that everlasting tickle.<br/><br/>I do enjoy Mr. Schelling's playing, but I never was more glad to get out of a concert. Madame de Castillo Najera and I agreed that it was probably largely nervousness and from the point of view of diplomatic understanding, I think we achieved a bond in discomfort which will always make us feel more at home together. But even to achieve this, I would not like to go through this morning again.<br/>E.R.<br/>TMsd 15 January 1936, AERP, FDRL</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JAR" title="JAR"><img alt="JAR" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JAR">JAR</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252860/#Comment_252860" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T11:17:18+00:00" title="January 26, 2010 11:17AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't forget October 2nd, 1935, when Italian forces invade Ethiopia for the second (and significantly more successful) time.

What becomes of the colonial societies? In sub-Saharan Africa, is the end of support from the metropole what kicks off decolonization in earnest? Or do you have a South Africa/Rhodesia sort of situation where the white colonial apparatus fights to hold on to power without any prospect of help from the mother country? After all, both S. Africa and Rhodesia lasted for decades as racist white regimes after the end of any expectation of British assistance.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn Asia, this is significantly complicated by the lack of anything resembling a settler community in most places, though the Dutch in Indonesia probably come closest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252869/#Comment_252869" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T12:03:28+00:00" title="January 26, 2010 12:03PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing that came to my mind was that this is the Dust Bowl years.

The die-back isn't 99.9% in that novel; but the "President" and "government" in (IIRC) Denver are lucky if they can transmit on radio with enough power to be heard in California. BUT, they ARE the grain of sand around which the pearl of a recovered government could grow. Many, many years after the fall and consolidation.<br/><br/>During the fall, the President's just a guy with a piece of paper--and if I'm the guy with a loaded gun, *I'm* the President in *that* particular room, at *that* particular time. The authority of a person starts and stops with their capacity to enforce their will. Presidents and Kings have police and armies; post-apoc, they got little more than a nice suit.<br/><br/>-----<br/>BUT, even more interesting revelation... it would seem that we don't have a "canonical cause" for this apoc? Am I sniffing something to do with situation generation? If so... GOD, there's a TON of ripple-effect things to consider.<br/>* An evenly distributed die-off means, as others have said, that nothing which requires major infrastructure continues to operate. Power generation, whole cities, plumbing, etc.<br/>* A population-density-related die-off could leave whole towns (and their coal plants and sewage treatment facilities) untouched.<br/><br/>* A die-off with a specific inception point will cause migration and border conflicts and all sorts of shit to do with mobility and escape.<br/>* A die-off that's evenly or randomly distributed will cause holing up and isolation (if the cause is something that can even be avoided! Speaking of which...).<br/><br/>* A non-sentient source of the apoc causes a certain "feel" to the apoc--random, human-induced maybe and thus a source of guilt, but nevertheless capricious and ignorant of suffering. Man v. Nature, in a nutshell.<br/>* A sentient agent gives a-whole-nother feel--predation, "evil" in a classic monomaniacal sense, enslavement, harvesting, worse. It could still be "capricious" as in unfeeling or remorseless. But, generally, it's an enemy at which characters can be aimed and it can be a point against which survivors rally. Man v Man (or v Himself).<br/><br/>So I guess I have a new follow-up: Are we trying to help you find "setting nuggets" for a prescribed apocalypse? That's not too tough to deduce, and it basically makes a laundry list.<br/>Or are we trying to provide points of divergence which can be considered in the light of ANY apocalypse? THAT's going to be tougher, as it requires more of a consideration of cause and vector and speed of the die-off. It might just be too much to systematize (or it might be something that can just be rolled off a gaggle of charts with a hand wave at "logic" or "historical fidelity"?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253186">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone" title="Quintin Stone"><img alt="Quintin Stone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://rps.net/QS/Images/pipboy-32x32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Quintin%20Stone">Quintin Stone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253186/#Comment_253186" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T11:55:14+00:00" title="January 27, 2010 11:55AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>So, I don't think you'd HAVE a US President or a UK King or ammunition for most weapons (MAYBE WWI stuff) and certainly not any hydrogen lying about to fill Transatlantic zeppelins!</blockquote>\nFunnily enough, the bulk of WWII weapons used ammunition that was designed for WWI or earlier.  So the Germans have their famous MG 34 firing a round first produced in 1888 (but not their infamous MG 42 if the world ends in the 30s).
