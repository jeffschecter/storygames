Our weird mashup includes using Car Wars rules combined with PTA's Issue, Connections, Nemesis, and Screen Presence.  Our Car Wars campaign is filtered through the lens of a camera.<br/><br/>Our series began as a mini-series on the Sci-Fi channel, we burned 2 sessions on the pre-published Convoy mission before hitting our stride and kicking into Season 1 Episode 1 which we just finished tonight.  Did I mention our theme music is Deep Purple's "Highway Star"?  Completely perfect.<br/><br/>Basic plot - the players were all members of a duel team out of St. Louis Missouri who defected, stealing all of their automobiles after discovering evidence of Management fixing matches.  Initially thinking they had hit a bad string of luck, the group finally was able to pin down that their chief mechanic was instructed to sabotage their own vehicles in a massive conspiracy of fixing Autoduel matches.  <br/><br/>The defected Krieg Motors group:<br/><br/>"Drive-by" Dave Larson - Drives a fiery compact named "Betty" - Issue: Vanity, it's all about the camera<br/>Greasy Lester, The Mechanic - A heavily armed stationwagon named "The Locomotion Commotion" he stole from a fellow Krieg Motors duelist - Issue: Goddamn thief<br/>Hammerhead - Insane bastard mans point with his rocket boosters and ram plate - Issue: Junkie<br/>Cliff - Drives The Cliff Hanger, a nasty pickup with an ATG, VMG, and Ramplate - Issue: Reckless<br/><br/>The group was headed back to St. Louis, branded outlaws and bounties placed upon their cars and heads by Krieg Motors - their former national dueling corporation.  Heading back into St. Louis they were planning on nabbing Jonesy, the former head mechanic, in an attempt to follow the conspiracy up the ladder and eventually acquire enough evidence to convince the public and news crews of this massive cover-up.  <br/><br/>We had some great scenes of pure roleplay where the team snuck into the mechanic pits at old Busch Stadium, hopping the guard rail and one of the members being recognized for his former Autodueling glory.  Before their cover could be blown, they tracked down Jonesy which gave way to a foot pursuit.  Pinning the bastard down and making a getaway in a 4 wheel Gator, Drive By Dave Larson and his buddies were able to extract that orders were coming down from the Circuit Commissioner himself to team Manager.  <br/><br/>The final scene was a miraculous city battle where the team ambushed their former manager's bus/convoy heading out of town on its way to Springfield.  After taking out the armed escort, there was a good 4-5 seconds of trading broadsides as more than one car of the PC's caught fire only to be saved by a last second fire extinguisher roll.  You have to love that 1 in 6 chance of your car exploding if you're on fire and armed with an ATG.<br/><br/>The battle ended with Lester making a prolific statement into his car mounted camera about payback coming to Krieg Motors and everyone involved in the obfuscated corruption eating away at the roots of the sport.  The episode cuts to credits with the recorded tape being left anonymously with a newstation and the whole battle and subsequent gunning down of the unarmed Manager being played to the public.  The closing music - Queen's "I'm In Love With My Car".<br/><br/>Are the Krieg St. Louis Defectors heroes?  Maniacs?  Public enemies?  Only the next episode will tell as the group departs to track down Circuit Commissioner Biron Hersch.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216365/#Comment_216365" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T09:58:46+00:00" title="July  4, 2009  9:58AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah!

Is it simply alternating PTA role-play with Car Wars battles, or is there some overlap of mechanics?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216401">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216401/#Comment_216401" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-04T13:23:55+00:00" title="July  4, 2009  1:23PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a fan of Car Wars and PTA, and a long-time resident of St. Louis, I approve this AP.<br/><br/>And yes, I'd love to hear about how you timed the dueling and story scenes.

I wanted the group to flesh out some of the supporting cast and this proved an easy way to do it.<br/>-Nemesis: same as in PTA<br/>-Screen Presence: We decided to use this just for the basis of the character's story arc, no actual mechanical effects here<br/>-Fan Mail: Each chip may be used to add 1 or subtract 1 from a Car Wars skill roll.  Only 1 chip may be used at a time.  I throw about 4 into the pot at the beginning of each session.<br/><br/>As far as scenes go, we basically play it like PTA until we drive play towards a battle.  We're all on the same page and our pacing seems to be about 2 Car Wars encounters a night; one small encounter and one large combat.  Works pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
