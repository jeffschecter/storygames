I don't write novels for people to slog through, but there are a fair number of movers and shakers in the city. It always seemed fair to me, because that way people won't be coming in cold. They can be -established- in the city, and know "oh, if I need to get bailed out of jail at 4am, I go to Benny."<br/><br/>My general theory is "put all the information out there, if they read it, awesome, if they don't, it's their loss." Which works very well at my around-the-table games because I can prompt people, and get a read off them and what they know.<br/><br/><br/>Problem is, for this online game, even saying "there is this document that you're welcome to read, or not" isn't actually flying too well. Either people get intimidated by it, and skip the game all together, or don't look at it, and create a character that -absolutely- doesn't fit. The few that have read it have made awesome people to play with, but that's pretty few and far between.<br/><br/>I realize this could be a symptom of the fact that only 10% of players will jive with you, but it's frustrating.<br/><br/>So. Suggestions? Just don't make it available? Make it available but not expect anything? Cry?<br/><br/>Please advise.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434373/#Comment_434373" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T14:44:36+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  2:44PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, my proposal for your consideration would be break your doc down into little bits like a glossary, index it, and link to these chunks from a Table Of Contents page.<br/><br/>If the platform has the capability to do this, I'd stick a block in the sidebar of the forum itself, with categorized links for NPCs, Locations, and General World Notes.  Then link to the chunks from this block.  If you can do small popup-windows for them, even better.  So basically, while I'm playing your game and Necrothius walks into the room, I can look over there or click a tab in my browser, click on the word "Necrothius" and get a quick paragraph explaining the NPC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434374">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agentofchaos" title="agentofchaos"><img alt="agentofchaos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agentofchaos">agentofchaos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434374/#Comment_434374" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T15:08:38+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  3:08PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's brilliant.

(I hate coming up with a character completely unconnected to the setting and the rest of the group, and then everyone being roped into the story via one of the generic hooks.)<br/><br/>In order to encourage people to come up with characters that are tied to key figures or places, you could try to ask people to quickly answer a couple of questions: "What favour do you owe Aloysius?", "How did you find out about the Lost Way club?" (providing links to Aloysius bio, Lost Way club photo etc).<br/><br/>If you're using Google, you might want to look into Google Sites at some point. While their templates are rather horrible looking, it's very easy to create a website and import into it stuff like bios or lists of NPCs (Google Docs word documents), character sheets (Google Docs spreadsheets - take a look at templates for those, if I found a template for Burning Wheel you might find a template for WoD) and even a game calendar based on Google Calendar (which you're not going to need for sessions because  PbP, but you could use it for marking the important events happened in your game or something?)<br/><br/>Google Docs has some basic survey functionality too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434426/#Comment_434426" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T14:03:21+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  2:03PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The few that have read it have made awesome people to play with, but that's pretty few and far between.</blockquote>\nI wonder if this might be a feature, rather than a bug?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434428/#Comment_434428" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-26T14:10:20+00:00" title="June 26, 2014  2:10PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I agree 100% with splitting it up into smaller chunks and not expecting the players to read it all at once.
