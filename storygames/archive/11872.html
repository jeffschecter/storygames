You create investment in stuff that then matters later on.  In a one-shot, you don't have time for that.

The Lighthouse, Oracle, the burn flats, the nomad tribes... all stuff from our ongoing games at home. So it was easy to draw up a quick map and drop the PCs down in a tough spot. The character types chosen and the results of the pre-session moves also gave me material to work with for the starting situation.<br/><br/>Having said that, I wouldn't recommend that method for a first-time AW GM. If the one shot is gonna be your first time at bat, I'd grab Vincent's <a href="http://lumpley.com/apocalypse/hatchetcity.pdf" rel="nofollow">Hatchet City module</a> and run that. Spend some time with it before the game and figure out what stuff interests you in the module and what you can cut and ignore. There's no need to cram all of it into one session.<br/><br/>Oh! Also, you can totally steal the setup from Vincent's Sunday GS game. Zach, Joel, Harry, and Chris made a really cool crew that is perfect for a one-shot.<br/><br/>- The Operator, Proust<br/>- The Brainer, Cybelle (could be replaced with a fighter type, battlebabe or gunlugger)<br/>- The Savvyhead, Jessica<br/>- The Angel, Gabe<br/><br/>The PCs are the operator and his crew. They have a converted school bus pulling a trailer (the savvyhead's workspace). On top of the school bus, two big water tanks. The crew travels from holding to holding, ostensibly selling water, but what they really do is distract the holding while stealing anything that isn't nailed down (Operator gigs: Honest Work and Scavenging).<br/><br/>The operator will roll his gigs to start, which should give you a solid idea of what situation they're in when the session opens. You'll likely have some angry hardholder chasing them across the ash desert, or the crew will be heading for their next target on the horizon (or a mix of both). For prep, some ideas about a couple of holdings and their people should suffice. (Hint: make at least one of the hardholders a genuinely good person).<br/><br/>AW one-shots are uncharted territory. I'm happy to answer questions and work through this even more. It's an interesting topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Carl" title="Carl"><img alt="Carl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Carl">Carl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265273/#Comment_265273" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-02T21:50:59+00:00" title="April  2, 2010  9:50PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having enjoyed watching Vincent's GameStorm run, I was hoping that all <em>Apocalypse World</em> one-shots were titled "Hatchet City and Blind Blue" and not one of them would ever involve reaching Hatchet City or anyone Blind or Blue.  That's a scenario naming technique I've used to great success in <em>Don't Rest Your Head</em> and <em>Lacuna</em>.<br/><br/>An Operator and his/her crew seems a very natural fit for a one-shot, since they're either just getting into trouble or just getting out.  That had to be the most complicated refueling operation I've ever seen, but Plan D worked out just fine in the end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265303/#Comment_265303" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-03T08:41:56+00:00" title="April  3, 2010  8:41AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>Oh!

A couple of suggestions from playing/running AW at various cons:<br/><br/> - MC love letters are hot. Using them to immediately establish a PC-NPC-PC triangle is my favorite thing. It's also fun to give peeps other than the Operator an opening move. It makes them feel involved from the get-go and subtly shapes the opening narrative.<br/> - The Quarantine is a surprisingly effective one-shot playbook. New AW players always seem to want to know what the hell happened way back when anyway, which automagically makes The Quarantine compelling.
