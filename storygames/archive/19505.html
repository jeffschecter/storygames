It splits up forces and means troops fight in 100m bursts across fields favouring the defenders and often at very close quarters. As such they stand a good chance of coming across things suddenly, or hearing things well before they can hear them.<br/><br/>So, maybe a dug in tank, engine still running so audible from a distance, but abandoned.

This doesn't matter at first, but as the events progress, there is more and more incorporation of the character's specific psychology into the events: he's the only person who rejuvenates after being killed, the Paris they encounter is entirely based on his ignorant preconceptions, the occasional enemy encounters feature people from his life... The nightmare ends when the party realizes the truth, after which the scenario itself finishes with a short adjudication of the historical D-Day, where individual characters live or die according to the fates the dream predicted for them.<br/><br/><b>*</b> There is no resistance for a simple reason: the Germans have opted to retaliate to the assault with chemical weapons. The Allied invasion progresses as planned for the first 12 hours or so, after which the invasion force starts being bombarded with... chlorine, I think, would be the historical option? If you're planning for the game to span say several weeks, you could expand and expound upon the British retaliation in the form of <i>biological</i> warfare upon west German countryside - anthrax introduced into the livestock being the first move. (Both of these are margically credible historical possibilities - read up on e.g. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Vegetarian" rel="nofollow">Operation Vegetarian</a> if you feel like it.) Near to the end of the scenario, when everything in the war has well and truly gone to hell, the party apprehends the Ariosophist Ernst Sch\xe4fer who's used his crystal ball to bump German military planning to this alternate history track with all its horrifying consequences. Maybe the party gets a chance to travel back in time and sabotage the Rhinelandish railway junction the Germans rely upon to transport their chemical shells, if you like happy endings.<br/><br/>Hmm, seems like I'm most likely to focus on high-order ideas. Let's see if I can think of something more detail-oriented...<br/><br/><b>*</b> The invasion force soon learns that anybody falling asleep or unconscious in France cannot be woken up. They discover civilian population comatose or dead, indicating that this has been going on for a few days, perhaps. A couple days later the survivors start encountering SS troops who are being kept awake with methamphetamine and other party drugs. Could also have the comatose people start growing wines out of their eye sockets or something for more body horror - particularly when that starts happening to those still awake, too, after a few days.<br/><br/>Well, seems like I've got far-reaching ideas in my bones. It's because you haven't revealed your big strategy for the scenario, so my brain automatically goes for the big ideas. Could you reveal what your general idea for the scenario is - it would be easier to invent little horror scenes with some sort of overarching theme or mythological logic. Surely you have some overarching idea for why the Germans withdrew their coastal defenses, so as to make this an aberrant D-Day? Or were you planning to just make this a carneval ride into random horror imagery with no rhyme or reason?<br/><br/>One more try:<br/><br/><b>*</b> The party encounters French resistance fighters with Yellow Sign armbands. They seem ordinary, yet somewhat depressed and passive. However, they speak an incomprehensible language, and on occasion they engage in military operations (random firefights, sabotage, whatever) against enemies the Allied team does not perceive being there.<br/><br/>Now that's properly random mind-fuckery, finally, without too big scenario-wide implications.

They have to risk a paradrop at night or turn back. (This works best if you throw in some real facts about the difficulties of such an operation.) As the leadership cadre makes their decision, eerie lights can be spotted on the ground - landing lights, paradrop signal flares or urban lightning, except the colors of the lights are wrong. A decision to actually make a landing is probably not in the cards (unless the operation actually has knowledge of an airbase controlled by friendlies in the area), but a paradrop might be attracted. Everything seems normal, except that once the team has exited the plane and started their paradrop, the signal lights on the ground start moving, first slowly and then quicker in an elaborate dance, slowly dimming and leaving the paradrop to finish blindly.<br/><br/><b>*</b> The team comes to a cross-roads where the road has been dug open into a great pit, and an Abrams tank has been half-buried, with the work left unfinished. The signposts are all in Spanish. The tank's hatch has been welded shut. Within the tank, the team finds duplicates of themselves, with only one still alive.<br/><br/><b>*</b> Nameless mists confound the one who seeks the gate termed Iogsothoth. Opening a door with the silver key (to be found embedded under the skin of a team-member after some other eldritch encounter) leads directly into an alternate timeline where the Germans decided to fight the invasion on the beaches. This is in fact our own time-line, but the team might interpret it as the worse of the two worlds, having lived through a much less bloody D-Day. At some point they find that they have the option of passing through and making that world a reality; this could become a ticket out of a world too horrible to contemplate, but for those who witnessed their own deaths on the beach, it is not an easy decision. Furthermore, the enemy occultists may have an array of similar portals, and they're merely waiting to see which way the Allied command jumps before collapsing the quantum uncertainty and selecting their preferred reality out of the modal uncommitment they've forced upon the entire time-zone for the next 96 hours. (Hmm, again sneaking up to the strategic level with my weirdness here. Gotta stay modular, dammit.)<br/><br/><b>*</b> The team enters the city of Rouen, hot on the trail of the McGuffin. Rouen should not be here (hey, obviously), but nevertheless it is. The team witnesses what the city looks like five hours after a process of transformation has been begun: shadow-people formed of the shadows cast by the populace themselves forces the people into machines resembling electric chairs, branded with Nazi insignia; victims are separated into skin and flesh, both loyal to the "Transmogrification" - the skins fly, flutter and speak, the flesh merely obeys and slays. However, what the team witnesses is the logistical difficulties of this process of Transmogrification: there are people who have yet to cast a shadow of their own since it started, there are long lines and herding pens, there is a train station attempting to unload more of those transmogrification machines, there are skins and shades arguing about jurisdiction, there is lack of electricity, and so on. It is a process of a breath-taking scale, but it is likely to take weeks to process the entire city nevertheless.<br/><br/>Perhaps more later.

I'll just see what the ol' lizard brain brings, there's really no need to worry about limiting myself to individual scenes. These are ultimately easy enough to set up and knock down if one wants to, after all. If nothing else, they make for good fodder for gibbering NPC conspiracy theories.<br/><br/><b>*</b> In the days following D-Day the military authorities between company and brigade level from parallel command chains involved in the D-Day operation prove, one by one, to be brainwashees with uncertain loyalties; they've been infused with the juice of a rare Indochinese poppy, the <i>Papaver Berthelotii</i>, over extended periods of time, making them susceptible to their handlers. A side effect causes the victim's facial skin to loosen and sag, muting expressions, with the face peeling off entirely after about six months of continuous exposure. The only command chain seemingly untouched by this peril is that of the PCs. The intel divisions find it extremely unlikely that this would be German work, considering their traditional incompetence in all things HUMINT. Later on, PCs might well be properly paranoid about exotic fumes, offerings of food and so on, especially after some lost time episodes and the occasional morning awakening with a numb face.<br/><br/><b>*</b> The team encounters a farmhouse which young mathematician Alexis Hocquenghem has fortified weeks ago (subjective time) against the prowling inhumans du jour (that is, whatever has been established as the local zombie-equivalent in the scenario). His method of security involves using caged children as bait in pneumatically operated traps (air guns or trapjaws or whatever, depends on the nature of the predators), which unfortunately might (likely will) work against Team Hero as well. Hocquenghem himself has, obviously, lost his mind as outcome of his work in decoding the magical state that's gripping northern France, so all he does anymore is feed (and replace from a cellar) his bait and scribble in his work room, filling its walls with obscure mathematical equations. The team might be able to procure a dimensional map or other such guidance from his work - or it might confirm for our purposes the utter impossibility for even the greatest of human minds to grasp what has happened.<br/><br/><b>*</b> The team has to decide whether they're drinking local water (which might or might not seem suspect). The feces of any who do crawls away discreetly and follows the team at a safe distance, waiting to accumulate more biomass from the source. Assuming it is not interfered with, and it doesn't lose the team's trail, the feces slowly forms a doppelganger of its originator(s), which gets up to ordinary doppelganger hijinks - try to kill the original, return to friendlies claiming to be the original, whatever.<br/><br/><b>*</b> The team encounters some German patrols now and then, all without unit patches of any sort. Their response to any initiative is comparatively lethargic and delayed. Officers thus accosted will without fail uncork a bottle of some green-tinted liquid and be born directly up into space by nightgaunts, which from PC perspective looks like a pillar of black light piercing the heavens, visible like five miles away. Soldiers killed will bleed black, thick sludge, and those taken captive are unresponsive to interrogation.<br/><br/><b>*</b> The team was provided with Geiger\u2013M\xfcller radiation detectors before departure, just in case. (Of course that's just part of their ABC kit, if they're an elite unit sent on an eldritch scouting mission.) If those are used, the team soon discovers that the countryside is criss-crossed by invisible bands of intense radiation. Crossing a band quickly is only harmful if the radioactive dust is breathed in; camping within a band for an entire night will likely end up in bloody coughing in the witching hour and death on the morn. (Up to GM sensibilities whether all this applies to unaware parties; I'm personally all for unexplained bloody coughing, and the horrified realization a week into the mission that the team's forgotten to measure for radiation exposure.) A team making consistent use of the detectors will find that the bands of radioactivity originate in minor nexuses that correspond with locations of these horror encounters they're encountering; following the bands (intrinsically an unhealthy activity; much safer to cross them than to follow them) to their grand origin takes the team to the scenario finale, whatever and wherever it is. Radio might not work across the bands if the GM prefers. The radioactivity is never explained by anything in particular, unless it's "ley lines", which of course explains nothing.<br/><br/>This is an interesting exercise in creativity in that I've never realized how difficult it is for me to do detail-work bottom up; I can spin top-down all day long, but as can be seen from my attempts at creativity, they're almost always intellectual in nature, and almost always predicated upon wider existential scenario-level issues, rather than simple jump scares. I almost always have to dip top-down before I can come back up with something scary, "clocks run backwards" just doesn't have the punch without that context for me. I don't think that this has anything to do with the horror genre, either; I would be just as unfettered if asked to generate details for a beautiful elven cityscape. I'd be all about deriving the beauty from the fundamental properties of what "elf" means in the particular fantasy setting <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433831/#Comment_433831" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T16:29:56+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  4:29PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2014 4:30PM by AsIf.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are some way fucking cool ideas in this thread.<br/><br/>Remember that Twilight Zone where the hero &amp; heroine are wandering around in an empty town wondering where all the people are, and it turns out they were like living toys in a child's playset?

It's moving fast, faster than they can run. Let them expend some precious ammunition at it, maybe a piat, but everything seems to miss. As it's bearing down on them from the side road it, and the road it was on, just disappear. At no point have the half track interact with the party, in its reality, they aren't there.<br/><br/>They come across a burnt out shop, strewn across the front are a stack of newspapers, the string holding them in a bundle severed. The front cover of each is a picture of the home town of one of the players, visibly dead is one of their loved ones. Those that can read French see it's the result of a devastating attack using a new form of long range rocket like none of the players have ever heard of, this will work particularly well for American troops.<br/><br/>They hear buzzing from a ditch, as they get closer there is a charnel stench. Lying, bloated in the dirty water at the bottom is probably every dog from the surrounding neighbourhood, each has it's throat ripped out as if by some large wolf. (The whole wolf thing was quite big with the Germans and Nazi werewolf troops is a very common trope) At night they occasionally hear howling an indeterminate distance away.<br/><br/>They hear children singing in French and laughing, as they approach the weather is warm and sunny, almost perfectly so (works best if it has been damp, or oppressively hot prior to this) the damage of the war slowly fades as they get closer to the sounds and among the ruins is a completely intact school with children playing in the playground, a pretty young teacher stands amongst them in a summer dress, a more scholarly elderly man stands in a doorway watching almost paternally. There are no signs of war. The players cannot interact with the children in any way and if they stay there the scene continues through the day and fades at dusk. If they enter the school building it is a bombed out wreck, add bodies to taste, and the scene of tranquillity abruptly ends showing their reality.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433995">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433995/#Comment_433995" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-18T05:03:47+00:00" title="June 18, 2014  5:03AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Late May, 1944: All medical personnel heading for France during the Normandy invasion were asked to be alert for a "mild disease of unknown etiology" with the following symptoms:<br/><br/>* Fatigue<br/>* Leukopenia<br/>* Erythema<br/><br/>with orders to inform the Chief Surgeon at once.

The earth turned to mud by the tracks of tanks and marching men, bridges blown up or rigged to be that way. Dead and dead weight left by the roadside. But no signs of an enemy following them. The players might never catch up to the army.<br/>- One side of a battlefield, just german troops, seemingly fighting and losing against ...nothing? illusions? Still there is death and destruction but no enemy.<br/>- The characters return to the site of a fight they had before, all the bodies have been dragged away.<br/>- A desecrated military cemetery, every grave opened and all religious symbols destroyed.<br/>- A blood splattered anti air gun. Lots of blood, as if it hit something giant and it rained down from the wounds. Another sign of an attack from above could be foliage that has been shot to pieces.<br/>- The burning city of Paris, visible for many miles. They can try and find out who set it ablaze and why. Maybe the Nazis did it or the allies bombed it, maybe the resistance tried to stop something.<br/>- Following a wounded enemy or muddy footprints the trail leads up a wall or tree.<br/>- Thousands of "dog tags" dangling from the branches of a tree.<br/>- A troop of german, vichy or spanish soldiers with the same job as the characters, finding out where everyone went.<br/>- A seemingly bottomless sinkhole opening up in the landscape. Right where a german unit was supposed to be.<br/>- The characters face on faded propaganda posters.<br/>- Nazi soldiers greeting them as friends and confederates.<br/>- The burned corpses of soldiers in a ditch, something is terribly wrong with their bodies and their uniforms no longer are recognizeable, if they ever were known ones.<br/><br/>Reading Chambers' King in Yellow and it's passages set in france could be a source of inspiration. The demoiselle d'ys and the Ys mythology related to it could be something worth looking into, if you want to do something besides carcosa. It plays with timelines at least.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad" title="Wes_the_mad"><img alt="Wes_the_mad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/649/nNGKML0VGFY5M.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wes_the_mad">Wes_the_mad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434067/#Comment_434067" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-19T08:34:24+00:00" title="June 19, 2014  8:34AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seriously everyone you all rock!
