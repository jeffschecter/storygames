For instance the Gluttonous Vampire Navigator or the Demagogue Rat-Catcher Captain or the Masked Thaumaturge Prisoner. Most of these moves are quite simple, and don't involve a roll. I've been finding that question-and-answer moves are some of the most flavorful and easy to write.<br/><br/>For instance, the Demagogue: When you stir up the mob, ask 1: *Whom or what do you resent? *What do you crave? *Who among you is most easily swayed?<br/><br/>Or the Rat-Catcher: When you wallow in filth and commune with the rats, ask 1. *On what do you dine? *What do you fear? *Have you caught the scent of ______?<br/><br/>Or the Serf: When you converse with someone in a hierarchy of power, ask both: *How is this person treated by her superiors? *How does she treat her underlings?<br/><br/>Or the Urchin: When you quietly watch how a group reacts to some external provocation, ask both: *Who\u2019s at the bottom of the food chain? *Who's unhappiest?<br/><br/>Or the Bard's Charming and Open from Dungeon World.<br/><br/>But so far this is just in my mental sandbox... how do you find this sort of move affects the game? Or, what are the qualities of a question-and-answer move that make the players really want to put it to use, and help it drive play forward? (Corollary the first: how would you rewrite the above examples to have those qualities? And the second: what are exemplars from other *World games?)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
