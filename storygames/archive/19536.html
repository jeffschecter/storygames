Characters are described simply; for instance "young, fit, gung-ho Marine", "dedicated, intelligent, not-very-athletic Doctor", etc. PCs who are better at something will, under most circumstances, automatically win Conflicts against Characters (or Obstacles) that aren't as good or difficult. For example, the Marine will just about always beat the Doctor in a footrace; while the Doctor would almost always trump the Marine in an academic test.<br/><br/>In the case of Characters of similar abilities, the winner is determined randomly.  Random checks to determine the winner are also made when conditions (environmental factors, clever Player schemes, injuries or impairments etc.) "lower" or "raise" a Character's ability beyond what it normally is.  <br/><br/>The Degree of Success is determined by how much the winning Character beat the losing Character/Obstacle by.<br/><br/>Are there any holes in this basic setup so far?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434328/#Comment_434328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T02:46:20+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  2:46AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, that's reasonable.

Two world-class athletes? Make sure players can't pick the same class. Everybody their own strength, so the players can use their creativity. Let's be honest: two fast characters running as fast as they can - what could be more boring?<br/><br/>(I made a game once and one of the characters is literally faster than anything in the world (his name is <i>Faster-than-the-Wind</i>).

I wouldn't have mentioned it except now you talk about athletes <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> )<br/><br/>But these are just unfounded hunches, until we know what you want to go for.

Boiling character creation down to a stereotype, with perhaps one or two wrinkles to add uniqueness would make for a great pickup and play experience. <br/><br/>I started to write down skills based on the description, but the more I got into it, the more they reminded me of things like FATE aspects. I think it would be nice if it could all be simplified to the gestalt of the description. The only way I can think of doing that is weighing the character's gestalt against the various situations that come up, and making a judgement about a target number to beat because of x, y, reaons. I don't know if that's more freeform than what you had in mind.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434352/#Comment_434352" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-25T08:48:41+00:00" title="June 25, 2014  8:48AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually came to a similar concept from another idea. It's like when you go min-maxin in D&amp;D and you only have two high scores. Doesn't that define any character? It can be Strong and Resistant, Quick and Smart, etc. Then you add a "class" and you're set. You could have a Strong and Perceptive Accountant and have him roll a dice with the Advantage rules from D&amp;D Next whenever anything involving these characteristics come into play, or a single one whenever it doesn't.<br/><br/>However, I'd really provide a list of characteristics to the players instead of letting them come up with their own. After all, you can define the setting you're playing with only using a short list of specific words. At least I could never play Fate because of a lack of a list of proper aspects for any game, otherwise I could have loved that game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_434598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434598/#Comment_434598" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-30T08:28:05+00:00" title="June 30, 2014  8:28AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Arguably, that is the absolute strength of Fate. <br/><br/>Mark, have you looked at Fate Accelerated or Fate Core?
