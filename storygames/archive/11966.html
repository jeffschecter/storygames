Rense, repeat until someone reaches a high enough level of Stand-outness (say 2 plus the number of players). <br/><br/>Middle game - the most stand-out player starts and trys to do something to fit back in. Roll 2d6 and the higher number is the number the other players must meet or exceed in on their turn (rolling 1d6) in order to further embaress their friend (add one to that player's Stand-outness). Dice that roll lower go into the Stand-out player's pool. When it is the Stand-out player's turn again if they have not reached some number (say 12) then they can roll the dice they collected this round to see if they can lower their Stand-outness. Every die that meets or is lower than the number they rolled on their last turn lowers their Stand-outness by one. If they lower their score to the number of other players then they successfully re-intigrate with the group. They get to keep any dice that roll 6 in a seporate pool. <br/><br/>If they manage to reintigrate themselves then they get to roll an extra die to try and push other players out until thier pool runs out. <br/><br/>If they get over 12 then move to Endgame<br/><br/>Endgame - the Stand-out player rolls all of the dice in their seporate pool to determine their end. 1-2s run away from their problems (let each of the other players describe where they ran off to and what they are doing now and the Stand-out player says which one is true), 3-4 suicide (the Stand-out player's body is found and the cops are vague on the details of her death; let each of the other players describe how the Stand-out player's life ended and then the Stand-out player says which story is true), 5-6 the Stand-out player chooses one of the other players and murders them describing how they do the deed.<br/><br/>That was just my initial thoughts. Numbers might not be just right but I thought they would work for a game like you described which seemed to be focused on a one shot experience. As I was writing it I kept thinking about the movie Mean Girls which had alot of this feel. I could also see raising the numbers and lowering the end consiquences for a Desporate Housewives sort of game. That would require some more "session level" mechanics for what happens in each episode. For campaign play you might also want to add more abilities and qualities to each of the characters that allow them to alter their rolls in some way or to alter others rolls to their advantage. Another campaign level mechanic could also be a way to gain new abilities or qualities, improve existing ones or impose abilities or qualities on other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267554/#Comment_267554" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T17:56:51+00:00" title="April 16, 2010  5:56PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure how it would work, but there should be a resolution mechanic based on the card game Old Maid.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_267568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267568/#Comment_267568" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-16T23:55:23+00:00" title="April 16, 2010 11:55PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh: a nice brief!

I would like to see how you made it into a McCarthy-game! Would you do it, or tell us how it may be done, please?<br/><br/>Not to ignore the issue, but I'm finding conception of a McCarthy-era game that specifically focuses on institutional persecution and a paranoid rationale exceptionally difficult. The answer, I'm certain, lies outside standardized RPG procedure.<br/><br/>&gt; Perhaps if one had an immerse LARP/jeep experience wherein the players interact socio-normally (with the possible exception of 'you are a film director, this is a 50's press-party, politics are <i>verboten/</i>taboo' characterization to push atmosphere/theme) until a signal is given. <br/>&gt; The players then, via anonymous ballot, vote on who is 'Red' (two-three votes makes you Red, depending in the group size). Everyone is secretly informed of his or her new designation and interaction continues but the  aim is to provoke potential Reds into implicating themselves in Un-American activities or communist sympathies.<br/>&gt; In the final part another ballot is held (or open denouncements, depending on taste) and the <i>Commie</i> is outed! The FBI arrive and drag the traitor away for interrogation, the True Patriots may congratulate themselves and wholesome American citizens can sleep safe knowing their minds are no longer being polluted. <br/>&gt; <i>Epilogue: </i> The Commie reveals whether he or she was indeed a Red. Were your paranoid accusations justified? Is democracy to blame? Are you a monster? Those True Patriots who are actually Red should now unmask themselves.<br/><br/>Not bad going for an Englishman, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_268751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268751/#Comment_268751" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-24T04:45:53+00:00" title="April 24, 2010  4:45AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2010 4:46AM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike: it's on the side of this thread, but still: I like it!
