I like a wide variety of board games (some favorites include: Pandemic, Battlestar Galactica, Mag Blast, and even Monopoly).  I'm also a fan of RPGs, though I'm dying to play something other than a fantasy setting; I'd love to try Diaspora for more than just one session.<br/><br/>Other stuff I enjoy: playing bass guitar, playing and watching roller derby, puns and jokes, movies, frisbee golf, and fun in general.<br/><br/>And in conclusion:<br/><br/>Hi! It's nice to meet you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_438733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438733/#Comment_438733" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-09-26T13:33:34+00:00" title="September 26, 2014  1:33PM">September 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah man, our group is recruiting right now, but we're in Denver -- that's probably a bit far for you.

I recently met a guy from Seattle named Ed who is also looking for a group.<br/><br/>Sadly, I\u2019ve barely gamed at all since moving here from Chicago.  However I keep buying them (e.g. Montsegur 1244, Itras By, Saga of the Icelanders, and the card game Gloom).  I must admit that I also have a soft spot for weird-fantasy-survival-horror-adventure games like Dungeon World or Labrynth Lord as envisioned by Johnstone Metzger.  It\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve played a sci-fi game (Cyberpunk and Traveller 2300 back in the day), but I\u2019d be up for Diaspora.<br/><br/>As for other stuff, I play a little guitar and have a modular synth that is sadly gathering dust.  I\u2019ve watched but not played roller derby (back in Chicago).  I read a lot of history and science, not enough comics, and wish more indie/foreign flicks would make it to the local theaters.<br/><br/>Anyway, it would be cool to get the occasional weekend game going.  And thanks for posting.  It finally motivated me to stop lurking and join the forum.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_438912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20C" title="David C"><img alt="David C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20C">David C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/438912/#Comment_438912" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-02T12:29:28+00:00" title="October  2, 2014 12:29PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi<br/>I'm in Fort Collins and am in a group that's in session.  We have 3 regulars + GM, which alternates between me and another guy. We mostly play during the week until about 10pm.  Our group is 24-30.  The game is a tactical sci-fi RPG homebrew that me and the other GM have been working on for a very long time. It's unlike anything you've played before... each class has a deck of cards that you add to as you level up or change between missions. The setting is that vampirism is a disease that has wiped out every alien race it has come into contact with... and now humanity is fighting all sorts of creatures of darkness (but Light, especially sunlight, can be used to weaken them!)<br/><br/>I'm also interested in playing other RPGs, but nothing too crunchy. I've never played Diaspora, but I do own 5 sets of fate dice from some other fate games I tried to get going.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric_D" title="Eric_D"><img alt="Eric_D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/550/nEPISQ5LYTX6T.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric_D">Eric_D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439026/#Comment_439026" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-05T09:15:30+00:00" title="October  5, 2014  9:15AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... would any of you be interested in meeting at a bar or caf\xe9 some weekend?

I've also played Call of Cthulhu, Classic Traveller, and GURPS. I'd like to do more of the games I already know I like, but I'd like to try out less crunchy games too.<br/><br/>I agree with Eric - let's meet up and talk about games. My schedule can be pretty flexible if I know it in advance, but weekends are always free.<br/><br/>You can also find me on Obsidian Portal under CatMonay!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
