It was perhaps my best GenCon yet.<br/><br/>I didn't play a lot of games: a huge 8-player Beast Hunters game run by Andy--we hunted the beast to death--and a game of Blood &amp; Bronze with James, Andy, Alexander and my wife Ami--Alexander crushed us all.  <br/><br/>I enjoyed seeing friends I made earlier this year at Dreamation and Camp Nerdly.  Got to have dinner with jenskot and Terry!  Saw Judd and got to talk a little classic Battletech with Jeff.  But best of all I made some new friends!  The standouts:  I got to meet Daniel Solis--who knew such a talented guy could be so approachable and sincere--we have to play a game next year!  And I met some great guys from down under: Lon and Scott.  We kept running into each other at demos and the Forge booth, so we decided to just become friends.  We played a quick card game and spent the rest of the night talking about differences in gaming above and below the equator.<br/><br/>I had a fantastic time!  I hope you did too.  Tell me all about it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88877/#Comment_88877" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T08:12:34+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  8:12AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2007 5:30PM by DanielSolis.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was super-awesome meeting you, too!<br/><br/>I'm still recovering from the whole trip but one of my fondest memories is AndyK showing us the Engrish card game "Make You Conquest!" which we extrapolated into a whole slew of "Make You ___!" jokes for the rest of the weekend.

It flowed well and inspired great situations and role playing. I enjoyed speaking with Jason about the game afterwards.<br/>\n- <b>Sign in Stranger</b> - fun! I want to play this with 6 players (2 players per character) this week!!! My sisters who don't roleplay would play this!<br/>\n- <b>Office Dogs at the Watercooler</b> - more like, waited for the GM to show up, and was scared away by a man with a dirty spoon... more later!<br/>\n- <b>Burning Wheel</b> - Spiders pinned me down, poisoned me, liquified my organs, and tried to eat me! 3 of us almost died! INTENSE!<br/>\n- <b>Paizo demos</b> - Paizo should buy D&amp;D.; I spent a lot of time hanging out with Paizo freelancers. They make me want to play D&amp;D; again! I love Pathfinder!<br/>\n- <b>Steal Away Jordan</b> - Only a demo but I like what I've seen so far. I was most impressed by Julia herself and how she would slide the punishment die towards me with a sinister look in her eye! I wish we hung out more! I like Steal Away Jordan's dice mechanics. I want to know more!!!<br/>\n- <b>Dirty Secrets</b> - I helped guilt Greg Stoltze into buying Dirty Secrets! And Ben killed Ralph multiple times! And Seth's a kind and cool human being. We win!<br/>\n- <b>Prime Time Adventures</b> - Enough said! I will quote Joshua, "the most reliably fun game ever!"<br/>\n- <b>World of Warcraft Card Game</b> - Cool game! Like magic but much better! Had a San Juan feel to it. There is no Mana and you can use all cards as resource cards. There are also quests you can fulfill for additional resources.<br/>\n- <b>Starcraft 2 video game demo</b> - Crazy! Too much for me! But looked cool!<br/>\n- <b>Jungle Speed</b> - I cut my hand in 3 places and made 2 new friends!<br/>\n- <b>Esoterrorists</b> - Fun demo. I really like Robin D. Laws. A little too rules light for me without enough free form inspiring improv type mechanics and no real situation generator. Fear Itself looks more promising!

And I wanted to spend way more time with many of the people I did socialize with. I missed Meg!<br/>\n<br/>\nT H O U G H T S:<br/>\nWith Games on Demand, Exhibit Hall Demos, and gaming after hours at the Embassy Suites... you almost never have to sign up for another gaming event and still have a full con!<br/>\n<br/>\nShort 20 minute card games are much more conducive for socializing after hours than 4 hour RPGs.<br/>\n<br/>\nNathan is an evil bastard! I was looking at Reign... looking... not buying and then Nathan quickly refilled the empty shelves so there was no where for me to put the book back. So I bought it! Nathan = evil, me = weak willed.<br/>\n<br/>\nI spent a lot of money and I don't think I made one bad purchase. 90% of what I bought was based on creator name only. If I recognized the name and associated it with positive thoughts, bam... money spent! I bought games I may have never bought otherwise but I was pleasantly surprised with what I ended up with.<br/>\n<br/>\nWTF! Some people are... umm... ok, picture this... I arrive at my Office Dogs game. No GM shows up for 30 minutes. I'm socializing with the players except for 1 person who refuses to shake my hand, which is completely cool but he seemed strange. Then he begins eating a jar of pickles with a spoon. Squirting pickle juice all over the table. He escalates to eating a non-cooked can of beans! Next comes his light grey shirt. He takes his dirty spoon, folds his shirt around it, presses down and wipes his spoon clean leaving pickle juice and bean smears on his clothing! Then he drops the spoon on the table... looks at me and says, "why are you socializing so much and being friendly... don't you realize this is a con... were here to play games." I quickly left!<br/>\n<br/>\nI love flying home from a huge con! Its one of the best ways to run into fellow gamers who live in your area. Great opportunities for socializing! We also ran into Jared who was waiting for his flight to Boston right next to our gate. Jared is cool and sweet. I wish we had more time to hang out!<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking about more time, next year I will make sure to leave Monday morning instead of Sunday night. I wanted more time to hang out with people. Terry and I wanted to play games with Ron on Sunday but time worked against all of us. Terry said, "a lot of those people are really cool, Emily was awesome, I hope everyone comes again next year... can't wait!"<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks everyone for such a great time!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88901/#Comment_88901" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T11:01:23+00:00" title="August 20, 2007 11:01AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So jealous.

That way, I can help you track him down so we can take turns cockpunching him. And then give him a "banned from gaming" tattoo on his forehead.<br><br>As for myself, I had a very weird GenCon. I really didn't do much of anything, and I'm not sure why. I spent most of the convention drunk and saying hi to the folks I never see any other time, so that was cool, but I didn't really get to hang with them for any length of time, which sucked. <br><br>One memorable experience was going out for a smoke and looking at the guy standing next to me. I'm thinking, "this guy looks really familiar for some reason....oh, yeah...he was on Futurama....it's Gary Gygax." So I shook his hand and thanked him for giving birth to the hobby that I love so much. He said that was heartwarming, which is either a standard polite response, or genuine, but either way it was cool.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88906/#Comment_88906" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T11:26:25+00:00" title="August 20, 2007 11:26AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 20, 2007 4:05PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a really great time.  The whole week I was sort of fighting some sickness and had low energy and a sort of brain fog, but I adapated and overcame.  I ran two four-hour scheduled games, played a game every night (<i>Beast Hunter Squadron, Roanoke, Food Holes</i>, and <i>Acts of Evil</i>), and demoed, demoed, demoed, both my game and other people's games.  I sold a lot of copies of <i>Contenders</i>, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>, and <i>The Committee for the Exploration of Mysteries</i>.  I was proud-by-proxy that <i>SotC </i>did so well in the Ennies and Indie game awards.  I was surprised and pleased at the reception <i>Grey Ranks</i> had - I'd set my expectations low, but people were enthusiastic and receptive.  I think, in my demo, various people sacrificed their own mother for Polish freedom about fifty times.  I wanted to hug the guy who said "No, fuck that - I love my mom.  Mission fails, Germans win."  Rockingly awesomely awesome to put faces to names and hang out, make new friends, reconnect with old friends, be pretentious wankers, etc.  I'm super energized to think critically about the new games I brought home and play the hell out of them.  Also!  Gary Gygax ran over my foot with his Rascal!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20D.%20Jacobson" title="Justin D.

On a general note, I felt like I made a lot more personal connections, e.g., dinner with Daniel, Fred, Rob, and several others, picking Ron's brain on a big project I am working on, etc. As usual, I was often too tired or suffered bad timing, so I wasn't able to get into the after-hours gaming like I wanted to.<br><br>As far as gaming goes, I only managed to crank out 5 or so demos of Passages. The first two days, I spent 90% of my time preparing for my Dawning Star VIP Game to benefit charity. Saturday I had to run an actual event; and I left early on Sunday. But I did have one direct-from-demo purchase, which is always very satisfying.<br><br>VIP Charity Game: This was a success by every measure. I was able to score two overstuffed bags of swag for the players/attendees. I'll have a full list of donees in my full press release, but I do want to mention S-G folks: Gregor gave me a copy of Best Friends; the Evil Hat guys donated a copy of SotC (that our VIP, JD Wiker claimed for himself), and Julia donated a copy of Steal Away Jordan. When she offered, I was hesitant; candidly, I couldn't see a big crowd of d20 sci-fi fans going for serious story-gaming about slavery. I am happy to report that JD's SO happens to be a history professor and was very excited about it. The event itself went off without a hitch. Everyone showed up on time. The game itself ran smoothly and was a lot of fun. The food was great and<i>cheaper</i> than I had planned for.<br><br>The best part of the game was something I yoinked from someone here (Jason?) about taking real-time donations to influence the game. We stuck a big empty bowl in the middle of the table. 20 minutes in, the party split up, and I dropped $20 to commemorate the event. It started slowly, but the money really started flying. Players were throwing in bills to confirm crits, increase save DCs on their tear-gas grenades, and generally avoid death. At one point, the PCs entered the elevator, and one of the attendees dropped in $5 to make it play bad elevator music. As I hoped, the attendees (many being friends of some of the players) were dropping money in to fuck with the PCs or help out the evil vaasi, and the PCs were dropping money in to boost themselves back up. We had donations from $2 to give the wolf player fleas to $60 to "summon" a vaasi war mech. And Lee Hammock is, hands down, the best GM on the planet. He rolled with it all and gave all the players their money's worth.<br><br>I lied. The best part was that, all told (including a modest personal donation to make it a nice even number), I was able to raise $2,500 to benefit the Shriner's Hospitals for Children. My tagline for the event was "A Good Time, and a Good Cause."

Right before I left for home on Sunday, I got a great demo of Reign from Ron Edwards. The demo was great not just because of the game which I eventually bought, but because Ron was so enthusiastic and open to discussing game theory and book organization, positive and negative. Thanks, Ron. Daniel Solis signed my copy too. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Picked up Dogs while I was there and also bought Grey Ranks after a fun demo with Jason.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpeaking of Ron Edwards, we picked up his It Was a Mutual Decision and am reading it in conjunction with my very first Gencon purchase, Breaking the Ice. Unfortunately, my crew didn't get demos of these games, but I am happy to have purchased them nonetheless to give them a read. Had a great discussion at the Seven Circle booth with Gareth-Michael Skarka about Qin which I also bought. He was very cool in telling me that Qin would be better for my wu-xia game than his own Hong Kong Action Theatre though he was happy that I knew his game.<br/>\n<br/>\nNon-game-wise, I had fun at the dances and parties. Though, I think that they need to hire a better DJ for next year's dance who knows his audience slightly better and doesn't do that annoying DJ thing of stopping the songs to make the crowd sing acapella. For my cons, I like a combination of gaming/demos/panels by day and dancing/drinking by night. I'm home now to catch up on sleep.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was great meeting everyone!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_88957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88957/#Comment_88957" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T14:45:23+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  2:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ron was a demo machine!

I had a blast. It was really nice to not have the pressure of selling a new game. My booth activity was more focused on the IPR side and on helping out the new booth folks, which was cool. Meeting new people is always cool, but I also like to try and develop my relationships with friends that I only see at cons. So I did a lot of that, I think, and I really liked it. To my new friends, it was great to meet you and I look forward to interacting with you more, over the intarwebs and in person when I get to see you! To my older friends, I'm really glad I got to spend more time with you, it really made the con meaningful for me.<br><br>I'll have some more in-depth reflections on the ol' bloggy, and some pictures! But in breif:<br><br>GAMES PLAYED:<br><br>- Beast Hunter Squadron (Thurs Nite). The squadron was cool, but I was so exhausted that after I got eaten I started dropping off. It made me want to play more Beast Hunters tho, so that was cool. Many kudos to Andy for stepping up and wrangling our squadron!<br><br>- Darkpages (Fri Nite). This is Jared's dark comics game, if you haven't been paying attention. I ran a playtest for an intimidating set (Jared, Jason, Dave, Thor, Mike), and it was really, really productive, I thought. A lot of fun in the "joy of fixing things" sense.<br><br>- Roanoke (Sat Nite). Kevin ran it for me, Clint Krause (the designer), Eric Boyd, Jason Morningstar and Matt Snyder. Our characters were great, and we a lot of really fun moments. I think the hardcore story-gamers of us had some trouble, cuz Wushu comes from a totally different design aesthetic, but I'm really glad we played. And I had a ton of fun playing with these people - we need to play more, all of you!<br><br>- Darkpages again (Sat Nite). Alexander demanded a game, so I sat down with him and Kevin to do some Darkpages-ness. We made cool characters and ran through some of the new stuff from the last nights playtest, but by then it was 2 in the morning and we were all falling over exhausted. It was nice for me to solidify some of the changes in my head, tho, and again, a solid group of friends to play with.<br><br>- Acts of Evil (Sun Nite). Ron, Julia, JRS, Matt Gandy(right?), and Jason. We started procedurally and all made characters, and then realized that there's a GM in this game! So Ron ran and grabbed Gregor, and he GMed for us. We got through a round of scenes, which showed us all how incredibly intricate and well-imagined this game is already, and then had a really productive discussion about addressing some of the work that still needs to be done on it.<br><br>For next time: Smaller groups to play games with. While I had a good time in all of my games, I was really missing the dynamics of 3 or 4 people who are all rarin' to go with a game. My resolution for next year is to not play a game in groups larger than 5, or maybe even 4. Not because I don't love you all, because I do! But I think, for me, play will be more creatively satisfying, as opposed to the socially satisfying play that a large group usually means for me.<br><br>Anyway. You're all rock stars.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88984/#Comment_88984" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-20T16:10:36+00:00" title="August 20, 2007  4:10PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: hamsterprophet</cite>Wushu comes from a totally different design aesthetic</blockquote>\nPlaying Roanoke was really valuable and informative.

We demo-ed new games (like Grey Ranks) but also were looking for demos of games we already owned or in some cases even played to understand how the game designer thinks the game should work.  As you agreed, some times designers have so internalized their game and how they play it, they maybe forget that the rest of us aren't privy to all that information if it's not in the book. If there's a concept that's confusing, rather than automatically leap to the conclusion that it's a design flaw, we'd rather try and find out what the designer intended.

I was mainly at the Hamster Press booth running Engle Matrix Games. I really appreciated the Indie Passport thing - it brought in a lot of people. I didn't get to get out of the booth much or play in other people's games but I did get to do a seminar on Book Binding over at the Embassy Suits. That was a hard building to get into!<br/>\n<br/>\nI got interest in Mongolian Goat Rodeo - a board game/Matrix Game hybrid about a crazy horse race - based on the Afghan game Buzkashi. My demo team ran it out in the con. One set of players were quite drunk and enjoyed making people fall off their horses. Others pulled in Soviet land mines to stop lead riders while still others used hand gernades in the goat to take out riders. Wow! I've never played it that vicious.<br/>\n<br/>\nKudos to Ron and Paul for being featured in the 40th Anniversary Gen Con history book!<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then there was the Marshalling Yard when we did the tear down. Ug!

'Cause that's what I did. No "almost" about it. I made it over to the exhibitor hall once for half an hour on Sunday. Otherwise it was play, play, play and more play, all with the most enjoyable folks.</blockquote>\nThis is basically me as well, other than I also made a quick exhibitor hall visit on Thursday, too. My biggest regret is that I slept through Friday night instead of going to the Embassy Suites. Damn you, Andy K, for talking me into taking a nap!  Next year, there will be vengeance, or something.  I don't know. But this will probably be my plan for most future GenCons - GoD and Embassy Suites (maybe run a few scheduled games for variety's sake and to help advertise my games, but I'm hesitant about doing this, as it takes away from my GoD time...)<br/><br/>Next year, I'm thinking of volunteering at GoD during the Embassy Suites hours (they closed surprisingly early this year - 6pm - because the Embassy sort of killed people's desires to volunteer after 6, or so it sounds).  There are always people who get to the Embassy at weird times and wind up not being able to find a game (or, because of a lack of other people not in games, wind up not being able to find anything at all, even a <i>conversation</i>).  I want to provide an alternative spot for those people, of who I am often one - and hopefully take some of the steam off the ever-increasing Embassy Suites crowding.<br/><br/>(I also don't like how most dinner plans often seem to be made in the dealer's hall when I can't get in there; both last year and this year, it was only through luck and perseverence that I managed to not eat dinner alone every night; don't know what can be done about that, though.)<br/><br/>Memories:<br/><br/>Non-game things:<br/>* Meeting Mike Stackpole because we shared a limo. He's apparently a local, even - we were on the same flight (he'd noticed, I didn't)<br/>* Walking around the humid Indianapolis outdoors on Thursday morning, finding an awesome barber shop, and getting a haircut and my first straight razor shave.  Man, I was missing the dry heat by the end of that, but I think I've found a new stop on my yearly GenCon experience. That barber shop was awesome.<br/>* Showing off the scar. Telling variations on my brain tumor story over and over, again and again.<br/>* General hanging out at GoD between games.<br/>* Dinner at Jillian's. Dinner at Mikado (where I had duck for the first time). Dinner at that little out of the way pizza joint with Ron, Paul Czege, and others. Usually the meals I share are some of the best non-game times at GenCon, which is why I'm so frustrated that I'm locked out of the place and time where a lot of meal planning happens.<br/>* People asking me to be on podcasts. I think I still have everyone's cards.<br/>* A great conversation in the airport at the end of the convention - great enough I missed my traditional chair massage. I wish the mall still had those water massage booths, but they closed 2, 3 years ago? I need a massage after, or during, GenCon and there's nowhere to get them anymore.<br/><br/>*PTA Take 1: Frog-aliens invading Savannah, Georgia during the U.S. Civil War, and enslaving the whites. Getting my poor black slave involved in the Underground Railroad to ship the whites up north.<br/>*PTA Take 2: Jem and the Holograms, re-done live-action, JJ Abrams style. Synergy was the real star of "Every Stage Is Haunted."<br/>*Misery Bubblegum: Two words: Dan Helsing. Twice, in the same day. Misery Bubblegum was awesome, and watching the game morph between the two playtests was interesting.<br/>*Other World, Hardcore: Changing the feel of an entire game when the Emperor's assistant walks in and talks about how he is displeased with the plan, and my first, honest answer is "But did he see the PowerPoint?"<br/>*Universalis 1: The Male Rebellion. Cyberpunk game with old women over 65, all requiring a stereotypical 'old lady' trait - no characters other than these old women were allowed to have names at all.<br/>*Universalis 2: A necromancer I named Jared Sorenson because I just needed a name - animating the dragon carcass that the other players were using as their military base.<br/>*In A Wicked Age: The ghost with the forgotten name who at the end, claimed to be the dark lord - but was trapped in her prison. Very, very interesting, this game.<br/>*Burning Empires: Poor Remy, captured by Vaylen, everyone suspecting him of being one - but in the end, it was the little boy we saved who was the real mind-worm. <br/>*Hearing stories about other games - the eating contest being the absolute best.<br/><br/>*Fastlane: Wild West. A poker tournament going horribly wrong. Running this was exceptionally fun, and gave me some more insight into how to make the game a better product.<br/>*Ensemble: Birds of a Feather.  Crows in a Wal-Mart parking lot, we led a sortie against the Security Guard trying to get eggs. Of course, we wound up trying to get Silly Putty instead. The 'my little pony' duck blind the BB-armed security guard hid behind was inspired.<br/><br/>...and a lot more.  This was a fucking awesome GenCon, made all the sweeter because I <i>knew</i> I was wanted.

Lagged to buggery<br/>\n<br/>\nFor me the con was a mixed bag - no, thats not fair. It was a very steep learning curve that I never quite climbed. As this might have been the only time I got across to GenCon I didn't want to tie myself down to one thing or another and wanted to spread myself around. That was pretty cool but in the end all it really meant was that I never managed to do anything. Which was shit. It also meant that I was very impatient when it came to games and demos - hanging around at the Forge for someone to appear or at GoD didn't appear to be on the agenda. By the time that I had realised how to arrest this sickening development, I had a sickening development of my own. A really nasty foot infection and fever which effectively finished the con for me. And being ill, I never made it to the Embassy Suites.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a pretty shit con? No, not at all. I met loads of old CCG friends that I thought I would never see again, which was magnificent. I met a load of SG people at The Forge, the Ashcan Front and Play Collective. Clearly writing ' <i>you may know me online as VODKASHOK' </i>on my badge worked! I saw loads of very cool games because of the Indie Games Passport (which was a magnificent idea for getting us ultra-polite Brits to your booths because my mother would never forgive me if I just walked up and said 'Stamp Me!'. It would be so rude!) I got interviewed by the Sons of Kryos. I had a really pleasant chat with Malcolm and Joshua on the PC booth about how to move my games on to the next level. My entire group fell head over heels in love with Cold City and a very nice man called Paul took a fair bit of time to explain Burning Wheel combat to me and my mate which finally lifted the confusion we had about the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI did get one game in, the aforementioned 'Jem and the Holograms, JJ Abrams style' where my seven year old, spirit seeing, savant songwriter Angel and her teddy bear made big sad eyes at the table. It was excellent.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever my one abiding memory (apart from my excruciatingly painful foot!) will be the size of the portions in your totally fooked up country. I am not a small man. I am known to have quite an appetite. I COULDN'T FINISH THE NACHO STARTER!!!!! Sheesh!<br/>\n<br/>\nNext time, I'll know what to do, how to do it and when to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreat Con.

This was my first GenCon, so my plan was pretty much to have no plan and just float around and see what's what, which I did for a good amount of the time. Thoroughly absorbed the craziness in the giant dealer hall and the board game rooms and everywhere, but kept coming back to the "quiet zone" to pick up more games or see if people were around or whatnot. I eventually decoded the GoD/Embassy deal on Friday, and wound up playing a whole batch of very, very enjoyable games. The quick summary:<br/><br/>Demoed Grey Ranks with Jason, which totally sold me on a game I had appreciation for, but not necessarily interest in. (But I do now!)<br/>Matt demoed Classroom Deathmatch for us - I got a laser pointer to kill schoolkids with.<br/>Emily ran us through a little bit of Steal Away Jordan, which was also a lot cooler than I was prepared for. <br/>Got a Bliss Stage demo from Ben, which completely blew me away - I think this is my favorite new game this year.<br/><br/>Games on Demand saw me into a pickup game of Roach (with Rich and Jonathan and Holly), which was one of the most sedate I've ever played - I don't think *anyone* died - but which did contain an all-nude production of Romeo and Juliet as part of the Pemberton Follies.<br/>Later on at the Embassy, Jason ran us a playtest of Food Holes (his competitive eating hack of Contenders), which was crazy fun. The bee-eating contest and Razor Murphy, the chicken-flensing guru were both received quite well.<br/>After lusting at the Mechaton action going on next to us, some of us settled in to a game of Best Friends with Gregor and Julia and Emily and someone else that I'm completely blanking on, where we played supermodels - *super* models, fighting crime between the bitchy backstabbiness. Loved it.<br/>Wandered back towards the hotel after that, but got sucked into playing Werewolf in the convention center hallways for another couple of hours on the way. Freakin' werewolf.<br/><br/>I woke up on Saturday just in time to grab lunch with Joshua and Malcom and Rich, then headed back to GoD to play a game of Shock: where my conservative radio show host eventually starved to death in an empty Piggly Wiggly after leaving his family behind and fighting through the hordes of immigrants that were after his supply of anti-virus for the deadly flu that was slowly enveloping the globe. Ruling.<br/>I headed over to the Embassy, caught a couple quick rounds of Jungle Speed and Handy, and then just hung out for a while - I was hoping to play a game of that Finnish zombie game with the popsicle sticks and meeples with Emily, but decided to just sit in and watch the game of Poison'd that Vincent was running, to get a better grasp of how to run the game when it's inevitably clamored for back home. It's super vicious and awesome, and I can't wait to infect people with it here.<br/>I had to be at the airport for a 4am flight back (suck!), so I just had time for one more game - Emily grabbed me and Jonathan Walton and James Brown and we just sat down and improvised a system loosely based on Jonathan's Avatar game - it had some very cool little storytelling mechanics to it, and the narration and character development was very thoughtful and grounded, which was a great contrast to a lot of the stuff I'd been playing. Very sweet, and an excellent capper to an excellent weekend. <br/><br/>This weekend was all that I had hoped for and more, and I definitely know what I'm in for next time around, so it'll be twice as sweet next time around. It was great to meet and play with everyone - y'all are some of the finest people I've come to know in some time. I can't wait for this to happen again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89354/#Comment_89354" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-22T01:24:48+00:00" title="August 22, 2007  1:24AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ron Edwards</cite>Hey Skyla, that was such an incredible demo for me too, because you and the rest of the players were so thoughtful, enthusiastic, critical, and (how do I say this)<em>present</em>in what we were doing.</blockquote>\nThat was a really fun demo Ron, and in some ways it was even more interesting because you weren't that familiar with the system either.

It was so fun to go across to the Forge and Ashcan to dip into the atmosphere, get demos from the folks there, buy stuff, and then go back to my own home frenzy of demo and sales. We're growing at the right rate from what I can tell. <br><br>Playing at the Embassy Suites was all I remembered. Though there were some rocky moments--the playtest John Kim, Mike Holmes and John Wilson and I did of Jess Hammer's game never really jelled, but it did teach me the rules and inspire me to come home and play with my home peeps now that I've got a sense of it. And after that, all the games I was in were fun and inspiring: *Super* (hero) Models in Best Friends with Gregor, Julia, John Wilson, James and who was on my left?  Angelika's divine posing still convulses me with laughter. <br><br>Zombies with James, Anna, Willow and Tom--I wrote that up at the Forge. Dogs with many of the Playcollective on the last night: good down home killing of a bad seed, with the lesbian dog doing the honors to save him from the damnation of suicide while not being able to accept forgiveness from the wholesome dog I was playing. Then, the experimental game adapted on the spot from Jonathan Walton's Avatar mechanics which James, Mike Majcher, JW and I used to explore some sweet realist issues spun from the base of people we knew not too well. <br><br>But the best thing of all for me was many stolen conversations with friends new and old: talking to Paul Tevis about improv and acting after demoing his fantastic little game A Penny for your Thoughts; spontaneous interviews with James, Amy, Mark, Jillian and Jeff at various times about styles of larp in the US and Canada; talking game theory with Ben for 15 minutes at the GoD table and getting to hear how his games like Adventures in the Land of 1000 Kings were bringing him closer to home by approaching the games from the people who play them more and more; talking to Ron about Jeep form and the Forge and putting into words how different and yet how similar our approaches are; connecting with the poor, exhausted Jason Morningstar about the same topic after the booths were broken down, with him asking me to defend my position; having a conversation on the last day with Star that made me realize that,  yes, I do have to write the live action version of Under my Skin, the polyamory game that completes the trilogy of BtI and StM; and talking with Vincent on the way home about how far we've come as a community. <br><br>There was a theme there for me. I left Ropecon with new horizons opened up for me, and found them continued and filled by the many amazing people at GenCon with similar experiences and stories to tell.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90373">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90373/#Comment_90373" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T09:48:59+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  9:48AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2007 9:51AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of my favorite Gen Con memories was seeing <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/grey_ranks/art/greyranks_annakreider.jpg" rel="nofollow">Anna Kreider's character sketches</a> from her ongoing Grey Ranks game.

As a relatively experienced BW-er, I was a bit hesitant about a con game (especially after I kept pwning n00bs back in January at Dreamation), but Alexander gave me a character who needed someone experienced to play him, and things worked out well\xe2\u20ac\u201dat least at the meta-game level;  my *guy* got completely splatted in the climactic showdown.  But that's OK.  Sometimes I need a good splatting, as those who know me IRL can tell you.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nI picked up Dogs, which I have since run twice, and Grey Ranks.  It's very cool to see my name in the book!  Thanks Jason!  (Haven't gotten a chance to play it yet.)  The only other RPG product in which I've ever been mentioned is The Riddle of Steel Companion, and that's only my forum name, not my real name.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere was of course lots of ther stuff I wanted, but could not afford.  :-(  Another time, perhaps\xe2\u20ac\u201dI particularly have my eye on Beast Hunters, Emily's games, Steal Away Jordan, and a few others.

That was Andrew, my WW playing friend from Boston.<br/><br/>Passing Joshua A.C. Newman in the hallway one day, I tell him, "Joshua?" after he passes me, he turns around, does a double-take, hugs me, and then goes on on his busy way <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Going to True Dungeon, I think we accidentally got the Hardcore dungeon by accident. Some of the questions, like "Month's stones" totally didn't make sense to me. We don't follow that here. Anyway, it was cute how they had a girl in a skimpy medusa episode, so if any players looked at her their character was petrified. The final Beholder monster was left with _1 HP_ when time ran out. I scored several "criticals", a shame I was using a 1d4 staff, and that it was immune to criticals, heh.<br/>Afterwards Ewen, Mike, their friends and I went to a restaurant (The Ram, perhaps? It had a Privateer Press theme to it), where our waitress was really cute, but we waited about 50+ minutes (just to get our orders taken, perhaps?), and none of the orders arrived exactly right, or to the right person. We didn't tip.<br/><br/>Going to dinner with the indie alley people, but there were like 15 of us, and the restaurant couldn't accomodate us all. So I went with TonyLB and had food at a Mexican place, I think the rest of the group ended up not waiting the full time for the table there eventually. I found out TonyLB is Jewish.<br/><br/>There was a time I went to dinner with Harper, Snyder, Czege, Danielle, Wilson. I've talked of my water-caused nausea (I can feel the water going down in my body, and I dislike their taste), I've mentioned how I've got big balls, that I've known someone who looked like he were Paul's long-lost (younger) brother, so we've discussed some heritage stuff. It was an uproariously fun conversation. The restaurant we went to did have room for more indie folks, as we were about 20 people there too, but split across several tables.<br/><br/>Finding out how far the Union Station was when I needed to get there, and thinking, "Damn, I'm STILL not there?!" for my Unhallowed Metropolis game. The system wasn't too exciting, but I did end up killing a werewolf with one super-shot of my sniper-rifle. It was a small room, with too many tables, and one group kept shouting, they were excited, and disruptive (we couldn't hear the GM speak). Dan Davenport was also at the table.<br/><br/>Getting a demo of Blood and Bronze from Japes, and then The Hero's Banner from Tim, and asking Kenneth Hite why he was following me around.<br/><br/>Playing a demo game of the Samurai edition of L5R, understanding it much better than the edition I've played back about 2000, and being pleasantly surprised at getting to keep the starter set I've played in the demo. I was going to buy it anyway.<br/><br/>Playing in a playtest of Misery Bubblegum with Tony, Alexander Cherry and Danielle Lewon. We had fun with the setting we've created, and we all seemed to share the same mind-set, as at one point in our (magical?) high-school game, when you needed to have an "Aww" moment, I've just on the spot narrated how the school's ghosts said "Awww" as two characters kissed, taking a page from one of the better points in Harry Potter, the other players liking it, and having created ghosts in the setting.<br/><br/>Using my big brass balls and winning a game of Mechaton with either 1 or 2 white dice left, and nothing else. Mike Holmes also sat at the table. That was the only Games on Demand game I've played.<br/><br/>Full Light, Full Steam game ran by Jonathan Walton, when we all took too long to come up with character names, I made the suggestion that made a lot of sense and cut down on player/character name confusion, we'd just use our real names as our characters names. Jonathan became Joanna, and I had to remind people "Guy" is a proper English name (Guy Fawkes).<br/>We had a camel chase at the end of the game, a star-faring kind of game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Coming late to a WH40K game (well, after the other players), sitting down, listening to one player and/or his character whine/whine/whine, told him that I'd eject him from the shuttle's hatch if he wouldn't put a sock in it. He played the Psyker, naturally. All the other players (half of them I suspect didn't speak a word aside from stating actions in combat) cheered me on, especially later as he presented himself to the NPC we had to get information from and making an ass out of himself and us. I stepped in and two critical persuasion type rolls later I have all the information we need. It turned out I had the "Face" character <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>A cute moment was when we got to a major NPC, I turn to the GM and ask him, before we can do anything IC. "Does he outrank us? Do we know it?" and he goes "Ooooh, yes." and I turn to the Psyker and go, "Behave."<br/>I dunno why, it's always the Psyker/Wizard players in games I play that do it, heh.<br/>Talking to the GM later and the day after when I ran across him on the pacing of the game.
