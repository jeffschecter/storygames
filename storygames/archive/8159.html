These are the games running where the game's designer has bought into our stall.  There also may well be other games running I don't know about.  We're offering a free copy of the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8090" rel="nofollow">Collective Endeavour Journal</a> to anyone running any game by a designer who contributed to that book, so if you are doing so (or could be convinced to do so by the promise of a free book!), please let me know!<br/><br/><br/><b>David Donachie: Solipsist - AM, 4 players</b><br/><br/>You are a Solipsist, with the power to change all of reality at your slightest whim. With sufficient will you could remake the whole Universe in your image and enjoy your own private Nirvana ... only then you'd leave the rest of reality behind, and everyone and everything you love and care for would be easy prey for the Shadows, who desire to unmake reality just as strongly as you desire to shape it.<br/><br/>Join with other Solipsists in a desperate battle for reality when the Shadow comes calling.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Gregor Hutton: 3:16  - AM, Planet Endor - 5 players</b><br/><br/>Come and fight the Ewoks on Endor. You are a squad of Imperial Stormtroopers tasked by Lord Vader himself with eradicating all rebel life on the forest moon. This high-octane RPG gets an outing with a Star Wars twist.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Neil Gow: Duty &amp; Honour - PM, Death &amp; Glory at Waterloo - 4 players</b><br/><br/>A Duty &amp; Honour Game for Two Pairs of Players, to be played in two hours.<br/> <br/>It is the eve of a battle that will change the face of Europe and will be known simply as Waterloo.  Two cavalry officers jockey not for the glory of battle, but for the hand of a beautiful heiress.<br/> <br/>It is the eve of the bloodiest day in a long and terrible war and will be known simply as Waterloo.  Two grooms face the prospect of death, glory, promotion and loot. But mostly death.<br/> <br/>A game in three acts pits these fighting men against the French and themselves in the final struggle for glory!<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Rich Stokes: Savage Worlds/Cursed Empire - PM, Swords &amp; Stones - 6 players</b><br/><br/>A Savage Worlds fantasy game set in the Cursed Empire setting of Thargos.  No experience of either the setting or the Savage Worlds system are required, this adventure serves as a great introduction to both!<br/><br/>Word has come from an Imperial spy that the kingdom of Karnarcos is assembling a small force to attack the border town of Elliss. Needless to say most of you are not entirely happy when you're told that's where you're going on your latest mission for the Empire.  Ah well, one man's danger is another man's chance for glory!<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Conrad Murkit: 3:16 - AM, Carnage Among the Stars - 6 players</b><br/><br/>Terra\u2019s plan is to kill every living thing in the Universe to protect the home world. See where your tour of duty in the 3:16th Expeditionary Force takes you and your friends. Revel in the kill-happy machismo and enjoy a game of Carnage Amongst The Stars.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Scott Dorward: Hot War - AM, The New Covenant - 4 Players</b><br/><br/>London. Winter. 1963. It is a year since the Cold War went hot. This was not just a nuclear war: far more sinister, darker weapons were deployed from the shadows. Survival and re-building are all that matter now. But human nature and tragic circumstances mean that everyone has their own ambitions: a government desperate to hold on to what remains of the country; military forces who wish to expand their power and influence; frightened and brutalised refugees who simply want a place to call home. Into this maelstrom steps the Special Situations Group, a motley band of men and women tasked with the jobs too dirty or dangerous for anyone else.<br/><br/>A charismatic preacher has started attracting attention at Speakers' Corner. He offers a chance to reach out to the many loved ones lost in the war and speak to them again. His followers are growing, and they would die for him. Is he everything that he seems, and, if so, what does that mean for the future of London?<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Scott Dorward: Dead of Night - PM, Project Lazarus - 6 Players</b><br/><br/>Something is very wrong in the small town of Hope, North Carolina.  The dead have started to come home, and there's something following them.  Is this the start of the Rapture, God's judgement on the town, or something altogether more human and profane?<br/><br/>Dead of Night: The Little Book of Horrors is a roleplaying game based on B-movie horror, slasher flicks and campfire tales of things that go bump in the night.<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Rich Lacy: Contenders - AM,  - 3 players</b><br/><br/>Contenders is a role-playing game dealing with the shady and painful world of boxing.  Each player takes on the role of a contender, a pugilist desperate to fight his way out of the gutter.<br/><br/>Can your fighter build the hope and confidence necessary to become a true champion?<br/><br/>Or is he destined to be dragged down into a sea of pain and despair?<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>"Indy" Pete: Cold City - AM, - 4 players</b><br/><br/>As the Cold War rages in the full glare of the world media, the Underground War is fought in ruined bunkers, dank tunnels, building sites, and bombed out apartment blocks.<br/><br/>In the divided city of Berlin, the Reserve Police Agency hunts down monsters left over from sinister experiments and twisted technology. Things from beyond our space and time, strange creatures altered by bizarre machines, the decayed corpses of undead soldiers, things that hide in the darkness.<br/><br/>But the Reserve Police Agency itself is riven by suspicion, mistrust and political ambition. The four occupying powers of Britain, France, the USA and the USSR all see the need for the RPA, all contribute personnel, all have their own agendas...                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
