If I'm playing Sims Online and an interesting situation occurs between my character and another person's character, that's a story.  It doesn't have to be recorded anywhere, the story of the events that transcribed simply exists as a narrative in my mind and the other person's mind*.  And, I may or may not apply the lens of fiction to this story.  For example, I might think the story is about "Jake trips over a baby toy and Melinda laughs at him".  Or, I might think "I was playing Sims the other night and I made a character Jake.  I had Jake trip over a toy, and then Megan made her character laugh at Jake".  There are of course more examples.  I might describe it in first person terms, thinking about the character as myself.  I can leave these thoughts to myself as a narrative that exists in my memory.  Whether or not I acknowledge any significance about the fact that the events are a narrative doesn't really matter at this point.<br/><br/>But if I do imagine the story as fiction, I can take it a step further and portray such a narrative to others.  In an online game environment, I might use text chat to share pieces of a fictional story I imagine; drawn from what I perceive. Again, the perspective I use for this portrayal probably isn't too significant.  I could chat as if I'm Jake speaking to Melinda, or write as a narrator with a God's eye view.  Personally, I think the environment (online game) is less important than the medium (written text).  In a table-top environment, I would use speech to verbally portray my pieces of the story**.  I guess it's interesting to note how online roleplaying lends itself to literary techniques (writing) while tabletop/PnP roleplaying lends itself to acting and storytelling techniques (verbal, somantic).<br/><br/>So what's really interesting to me is finding out where this line is.  Assuming the above process, when have you crossed from "definitely not roleplaying" to "definitely roleplaying"?  Does it require deliberation to roleplay?  Is a minimum amount of skill required in the portrayal?  Does roleplaying require a back and forth between multiple people, or can one person "roleplay to" another, pure spectator person?  Can a single person roleplay by herself?<br/><br/>I would be interested to hear what other people think about this particular view of roleplaying: it's a tool for creating fiction.<br/><br/>-- John M.<br/><br/>* -- I'm not going take the tangent to discuss the phenomenon of a shared story taking place in multiple peoples' minds.<br/>** --  Hm, ironic that it was dubbed "Pen and Paper" while the roleplaying itself is verbal                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_318946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

We share the method and the setting; the interaction, but the fiction is individual. Each individual fiction is tangential to the other fictions arising from the game, and may inspire them, but in the end each player is left with his own personal story ... in a role-playing game. In a "story-game" this may be different. But I still regard most story-games as role-playing games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Big J Money</cite>** --  Hm, ironic that it was dubbed "Pen and Paper" while the roleplaying itself is verbal</blockquote>"Pen and paper" sounds nice, and has substance. "Verbal role-playing" or "dialogue-based role-playing" (which it actually is) are better terms.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Big J Money</cite>when have you crossed from "definitely not roleplaying" to "definitely roleplaying"? </blockquote>You do not cross this "line". It's not there. You founder about in the darkness of outer role-playing, and come to grips with new ways of doing it.<br/><br/>Or you could say; you cross this line all the time, in a game. We jump in and out of the interaction all the time. Role-playing is definitively not <i>just</i> role-playing, so to say.<br/><br/>As for defining role-playing games; I leave that to the game-smith; if he/she says it is a role-playing game, then that is what it is. Our preconceptions of what is, and is not, a role-playing game, is of little interest. If I disagree with a game-smith, I should test his/her game, and see if I still disagree. <br/><br/>This is a young form of expression, and it is changing all the time. So we need to continually change the way we perceive this form.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Big J Money</cite>Does it require deliberation to roleplay?

Nothing much to say about this. It obviously is.<br/><br/>However; you need to look into what you mean by "fiction". In a role-playing game that can be something very different from the fiction of a novel or a movie. I believe you have already said something about that.

Not in a mean "you'll never understand me" kind of way, or even a "you're not paying attention to me" kind of way either.  We just see things differently.  Even if it's only a slight difference, we all play a different game, and we all get something different out of a game.<br/><br/>The line between "definitely playing" and "definitely not playing" to me are purely based on mechanics.

I think as long as moves, rules and mechanics are on a line of causation that leads to the creation of fiction, then it's consistent with what I wrote above.  Time for the ASCII graphics:<br><br/>LINE OF CAUSATION: &gt;&gt;--------(DICE ARE ROLLED)--------(RULES ARE CONSULTED)--------(FICTION IS CREATED)----------&gt;&gt;<br/><br/>(This is one example of maybe countless possibilities:)<br/><br/>The line is called roleplaying.  I'm not sure that it matters what else exists on that line as long FICTION IS CREATED exists on the causal line.  Writing a book doesn't count as roleplaying because the fiction isn't directly caused by external actions.  Note that it's plausible to say maybe that the fiction was caused by SOMETHING at some point; but not directly.  Also, read what I add below about spontaneity   I believe this represents the idea as it was presented in the OP. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Big J Money</cite>when have you crossed from "definitely not roleplaying" to "definitely roleplaying"?</blockquote>You do not cross this "line". It's not there. You founder about in the darkness of outer role-playing, and come to grips with new ways of doing it.<br/><br/>I have a hard time seeing your perspective on this.  Notice I never asked when you cross the line from "definitely roleplaying" to "definitely not roleplaying".  That's because it's an easier question.  I know that once we close the books and go home, I'm definitely not roleplaying.  That point comes when we all simply agree to stop doing it.  But the opposite is more difficult to determine.\n<blockquote>Or you could say; you cross this line all the time, in a game. We jump in and out of the interaction all the time. Role-playing is definitively not<i>just</i>role-playing, so to say.</blockquote>\nI can see this being true; there are times when you cross the line back and forth.  What might be interesting to explore (or not) is when you are doing the line hopping and why.  Maybe it would just turn into a semantics thing, and become futile to even talk about.  I don't <i>think</i> this is where the original idea was leading, but maybe I'm wrong. \n<blockquote>However; you need to look into what you mean by "fiction". In a role-playing game that can be something very different from the fiction of a novel or a movie. I believe you have already said something about that. Maybe you should elaborate on it ... </blockquote>\nYes, I was thinking more about this actually; what other elements seem to be inclusive to roleplaying. I realized that I was forgetting about two pretty important things: characters and spontaneity.  If I could redo the thread title it could be: "PERSPECTIVE: Roleplaying is simply the spontaneous portrayal of situational fiction"<br/><br/>- Spontaneous because it's generated and considered "final" ("out there") in a very short amount of time - within what we call the game session.<br/><br/>- Situational because it's about characters in a situation.<br/><br/>BTW, The whole "simply" thing is meant to be controversial (which Stephen keenly picked up on).  It doesn't have to be "simply"; that's just an idea :-)  Pointing out why that doesn't have to be true is definitely fair grounds for discussion in the thread, I think.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite>Perspective:<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Roleplaying</span>Life is simply a tool for portraying fiction</blockquote>\nFair enough.  In as much as my original statement applies to roleplaying, so too does it analogously apply to life.  Or not?  One statement I think I am definitively trying to make is: 'If you aren't creating fiction, you aren't roleplaying'.  Can that statement really apply to life?  Perhaps an utter lack of fiction in one's life would lead to an earlier death, but you could argue it was a life, none-the-less.<br/><br/>Thanks for the talk so far!                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320120/#Comment_320120" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-12T10:08:30+00:00" title="April 12, 2011 10:08AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One way of defining story (not the only way, but it's one) is that you start with a conclusion - preferably an interesting one. From there, you trace back to the most salient causes that lead to that conclusion. You frame those causes into a narrative, which you present within a medium of expression (literature, audio, motion picture, etc.). And, once you have done so, you have a story.<br/><br/>From that perspective, stories happen any time that something interesting happens and someone takes the time to trace back what lead to that interesting thing happening.<br/><br/>In your Sims Online example, you could start with the interesting thing being "Jake felt embarrassed". From there you trace back to the causes - Jake tripped. Melinda laughed. Those things resulted in Jake feeling embarrassed. And bam, you have a little story.<br/><br/>Looked at that way, the act of roleplaying is the act of participating in a shared environment that is designed to to lead to interesting events with traceable lines of causation -- to create a space in which stories are likely to happen.<br/><br/>There are lots of possibilities for how to go about creating that space. The only one that is strongly implied in the name is the idea of taking on a role - acting as some sort of fictional character (even if that fictional character is only barely differentiated from the "nonfictional self" -- such as a portrayal of the self in an alternate reality). Other than that, there are tons of variables.<br/><br/>So, yes, chatting in-character while playing Sims Online certainly falls well under the umbrella of the act of roleplaying. Lots of things do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_323431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/323431/#Comment_323431" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-07T18:32:37+00:00" title="May  7, 2011  6:32PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite>Perspective:<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Roleplaying</span>Life is simply a tool for portraying fiction</blockquote>\nAfter thinking about this statement, I believe I disagree.  I can see a distinction between experiencing a story and portraying one.  For example: I go to the market and purchase some Dr. Pepper.  Later I think about the fact that I went to the market and grabbed some Dr. Pepper.  I realize that's a story.  If I do nothing with that, then I've "lived" the story, or you might say "experienced" it, or maybe you only say that I was "aware" of it.  However, I could also decide to portray that story in some fashion.  Lets' say that I tell someone about my adventure to the market.  Now I have not only experienced the story, but I've also portrayed it.<br/><br/>So, I don't think life is a tool for portraying stories.  I think it's a tool for living them, but you need to make the decision yourself to use other tools for the portrayal.  Books, films, plays, roleplaying games would be examples of those tools.  You are probably winking as I miss your point, but I think it's useful to draw the distinction.  Life is full of story potential, but it's quite possible for it to be untapped potential.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
