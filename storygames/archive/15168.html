Maybe it comes from reading too many Harry Dresden books and adoring all the details when he casts a seeking spell or summons a demon. I want rituals to be a more prominant part of my game, but am struggling with the way they are currently handled by the rules. The main issues I am finding:<br/><br/>* Too slow in casting.<br/>* The component cost.<br/>* Finding situations where the casting seems appropriate. (This has as much to do with the two above issues as anything.)<br/><br/>Some of the ideas I've had is to remove the component cost and to allow the casting prep-time to be done up front, ie when taking an extended rest they can prep several rituals. Also I've toyed with allowing players to forgo components and cut down on the casting time by incurring a penalty, kinda like when Harry pulls off a spell in a "messy" way that makes it less potent than if he'd taken the proper time and impliments.<br/><br/>Any suggestions? I feel like the rituals are some of the biggest "story" elements in the game, but my players don't see the value in them due to all of the restrictions. Any help is appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344746/#Comment_344746" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T10:56:22+00:00" title="October  3, 2011 10:56AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you played in Paragon and above?  I had the same problems during the low levels, but now that our party is higher level, the problems don't seem to matter as much.  In Heroic, 25 gp can seem like a lot of gold, and you only have a handful of rituals.  By the time you're beating up githyanki, spending 25 gp to cast Comprehend Languages or whatever is a pittance.  And you have a couple dozen rituals across the party, so it is likely that you'll have a useful ritual for all sorts of situations.  Each ritual might only be useful for a handful of situations, but once you have a lot, you're likely to have one that works already.<br/><br/><br/>(This is one of many parts of 4e where I think the game works pretty well but does a bad job introducing itself to players, so people go away unsatisfied.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344747/#Comment_344747" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T11:07:26+00:00" title="October  3, 2011 11:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ritual rules in 4th edition are a mess, mostly because the designers didn't take a distant enough look at it, and got stuck with a weak replacement for Vancian spellcasting. Here's what you need to solve to make it work:\n<ul><li>Rituals are leverage for solving problems on a strategic level. A ritual should never need to be mechanically attempted when there is no goal, risk and consequences in play. When it's just color, you just allow it, no mechanics needed. See the last point for the inverse.</li><li>Rituals segue into skill challenges, however you're implementing those; running a ritual is just a different name for declaring a skill challenge. Having your character know a ritual just allows you guaranteed access to a skill challenge with some predetermined bits - complexity, difficulty, etc. These rituals also need to be capable of being invoked as part of general skill challenges, obviously enough, so their definition needs to be such that you can expand a ritual skill challenge into something larger or plug a ritual in to cover a part of a larger challenge.</li><li>Rituals might still have costs, although the gold economy of 4th edition has its own issues. Resolve those, and determine the ritual interface accordingly.</li><li>The notion that rituals = magic needs to be dropped hard. Not only should all characters be capable of invoking special formal strategic non-combat conflict resolution frameworks (also known as rituals), but the effects of these rituals need to be more interesting in terms of fictional positioning (where you need to be to use it, where you end up by using it) and strategic scope (rituals ranging from minor solutions to large solutions to solutions that cause problems as a side-effect) while having much, much better fictional traction than the anemic "it's magic!" thing 4th edition has going. I visualize "rituals" like "Trade Caravan" (the character starts one from scratch, that's the ritual), "Knighthood" (with all the associated privileges), "Summon Contact" (not really a summon, just represents streetwise) and so on.</li><li>The GMing of the game needs to leave strategic space for rituals: players need to be able to resolve issues and influence tactical positioning (the conditions under which they go into battle) by ritual use. This is probably the single most important reason for why rituals suck donkey balls in all groups I've witnessed: even if you don't follow the pathetic railroad-GMing strategy advocated in the game texts, it's genuinely difficult to combine a real strategic layer of play with the set-up costs involved in 4th edition combat. I think that it's possible to manage this, but it's definitely a heavy burden on the GM. Become capable of actually allowing the rituals to have drastic effect on things, and you'll find that the players will want to use them. Who would want to use rituals in a game where the players know that nothing they do in between the fighting encounters actually matters?</li></ul>\nYeah, that's pretty much it. Of course somebody still needs to write the new rituals according to the above program, and some fine-tuning of the ritual access mechanics is probably warranted; instead of a generic "Ritual Caster" feat I'd go for wide themes like the magical distinctions between clerical and arcane and druidic magic, and the mundane ritual spheres of "High Society", "Underworld" and whatever else. The requirement of making rituals into skill challenges might seem intimidating, but it's not actually that bad as long as you keep it static: you can just decide that an "Identify" ritual will always be a simple challenge (the least number of checks required), that it uses these skills and those, and only one of the checks can be made with an improvised skill. Just think up an interesting failure consequence, like it was one of those Apocalypse World subgames. In general the ritual skill challenges should be short and static to make them easier to fit as parts of a larger skill challenge, and they can rely on quite few skills, no need to think up ways for all characters to contribute to them. By making the skill challenge rely on a single skill, as the most drastic example, you make room for situational modifiers; check out <i>Sorcerer</i> for an example of how to run an interesting demon-summoning ritual by basically checking and rechecking the same skill over and again. That's the sort of thing I envision.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal here is that when the players declare that their characters want to travel to the new continent, the decision to use a Mass Teleport ritual (or whatever it's called) is not an alternative for using the skill challenge mechanics, but rather an extra spice: the "travel to the new continent" skill challenge might be pretty complex, so it might involve something like six successes (been so long I don't remember these numbers anymore), out of which three might come from running the teleportation ritual successfully. So the ritual does not replace the skill challenge, it just modifies it and changes the fictional positioning - instead of going by boat we go by magic, but we still need to do the skill checks and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344752/#Comment_344752" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-03T13:43:26+00:00" title="October  3, 2011  1:43PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            what Eero says<br/><br/>And<br/><br/>I've tried before to add a more interesting magic system to a fantasy game. It doesn't work. At least it doesn't work unless your players get really creative around it, and if they do, probably they didn't need a system for it in the first place. You see, the time players spent adding color to their spells is time they don't roleplay, and usually make more of a subplot instead of being color or adding content to the main plot that involves all the players. More complicated/colorful magic systems work better in games where not only the setting but the focus of the game is magic itself, so all the players get access to it. You can actually make a game about magicians go medieval and let them use armor, swords and axes, and have interesting ways for making magick... but for some reason it doesn't work the same if you have a medieval fantasy game and the spellcaster of the party gets to roleplay more to make his spells, instead of just saying "I cast magic missile to the darkness"<br/><br/>Now, having all the party work together to pull a ritual and perhaps having the spellcaster of the group directing the orchestra for that part looks more interesting and feasible. It doesn't take PCs out of their role, they don't need to know how it helps whatever they are doing, but the spellcaster. And they get something to do while the ritual is being completed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344893/#Comment_344893" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-05T06:14:45+00:00" title="October  5, 2011  6:14AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One example of a ritutual that I have issues with is Undead Ward. It basically is circle of protection:undead. The problem is, it really only works if you know ahead of time the undead are coming, have enough time to prepare, and have no reason to just leave the area you are in. There is no "Oh crap, we're about to be overrun, lets hastily draw a circle in chalk and hope it keeps the zombies at bay til we can figure out a better plan!" use of that ritual.<br/><br/>Likewise, we have a bard with the ritual "Gather Rumors" (I may be getting the specific names wrong) where he sits in a circle, performs the ritual and then can "hear" conversations from throughout the city, pickin gout 2-6 possible rumors to use as leads. How cool is that! So far it's been used 0 times. Part of the problem is the base setting for 4E doesnt allow for a lot of city adventuring. I would love to have him in the ancient forest and thinking "Hey, I bet I could modify this ritual to gather lore about the woods." But as written, the ritual does one thing and one thing only. <br/><br/><br/>I really appreciate the advice above. That is exactly the kind of stuff I'm looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
