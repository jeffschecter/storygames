I really enjoyed reading all of your submissions, and there are some very strong games that came out of this. At the end of the day, I hope that YOU got something out of it!<br/><br/>I will be posting my comments on each submission here on this thread and <a href="http://rpgchallenge.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">on the blog</a>. They are rather sparse, due to the time I had to go through everything, but I have no problem entering into conversation about them.<br/><br/>But, as there are indeed prizes and winners and such, here they are. Let me emphasize that these are my totally subjective decisions...<br/><br/><b>The Winners</b><br/><br/>Best Game Overall : <b>Hell 4 Leather</b>, by Joe Prince. It's just the cleanest, tightest, most ready-to-go of the games that grab me. Joe writes good games, and this is no exception.<br/><br/>Best Extra Credit: <b>City of Refuge</b>, by Alex D. I'm using this award to say "man, this game has SO MUCH PROMISE, please keep going with it." Cuz it does.<br/><br/>Best Pair: <b>In Repose</b> by Micah Bauer and Mark Silcox. Both exist in that "story/RPG exercise" space, each has a minimalism and charm, and I they just pair together better than any of the other two-game submissions.<br/><br/>Best Outside The Box: <b>The Plant</b> by Jason Morningstar. My criteria for "outside the box" is what surprises me, and this game surprised me like whoa both in form and content.<br/><br/>Best Presentation: <b>Atlantis 2037</b> by Tony Dowler. Appropriate layout, good font choices, presentation that really reinforces the theme. Charts could be a little sexier. But of all the submissions this is the one that immediately hooked me graphically.<br/><br/>Special Prize: Best game suited for players who have no experience with RPGs: <b>In Repose</b> by Micah Bauer. I gotta give this game props. It's beautiful.<br/><br/>Special Prize: Bonus Art Prize: <b>Hell for Leather</b> by Sebastian Hickey. No contest.<br/><br/>Every Entry: I was impressed by every one of your entries in one way or another. Everyone who submitted a game is a winner! Hearty pats on the back all around.<br/><br/><b>The Prizes</b><br/><br/>For Best Game Overall: carry. a game about war. + any 2 PDFs of your choice.<br/>For Best Extra Credit: Time &amp; Temp (unbound print edition) + any PDF of your choice.<br/>For Best Pair: Prizes: One of you gets Dance and the Dawn &amp;  one gets Urchin, + you each get any PDF of your choice.<br/>For Best Outside the Box: Sweet Agatha + any PDF of your choice.<br/>For Best Presentation: Keith Senkowski Art &amp; Comics + any PDF of your choice.<br/>Kevin Allen Jr. Special Prize: Sweet Agatha<br/>George Cotronis Special Prize: $200 of original George Cotronis Art<br/>Everyone's a Winner: Your choice of Annalise or Dance and the Dawn PDF.<br/>Special Publication Prize: If/when you publish the final version of your game, email me to see if you're eligable for this (see below).<br/><br/>PDF options: Annalise, The Dance and the Dawn, Mist-Robed Gate, It's Complicated, or Murderland.<br/><br/>I'll be contacting the winners individually about prizes as well.<br/><br/><b>Archiving</b><br/><br/>I would like to archive the contest entries on the blog. Pease let me know if you DO NOT WANT me to include your entry.<br/><br/><b>But Don't Take My Word For It...</b><br/><br/>Keep working on these games if you still have any go juice for them, cuz they all have a lot of promise in one way or another. Also, remember the Special Bonus Publication Prize: any game that sees publication, in print, for money in a non-playtest final form will get the entire TAO Games digital library. Email me when/if you think your game is eligible.<br/><br/>Thanks again, folks. It was fun.<br/>-ndp                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245262/#Comment_245262" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T11:37:16+00:00" title="December  5, 2009 11:37AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>A Hatful of Rabbits</b> by Graham Walmsley<br/><br/>- I like your fun illustrations.<br/>- Rabbit Magic gives people what they deserve. Fantastic.<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: I like the sense of it, but I feel like there's something missing to pull it all together. Maybe something about each place you go has a Problem already? I'm not sure. Or maybe it'd be fine. I imagine it also depends on how old the players are. This could be a neat packaged game with the hat and balls and cards with the fun illustrations on them. Also, the last rabbit has an arm that looks like a thumb.<br/><br/><b>A History of Giants</b> by Sage LaTorra<br/><br/>- Definitely written for existing gamers/story-gamers.<br/>- Humanity?<br/>- Yay mad libs character sheet!<br/>- Lists for Devices are secret?<br/>- I like Knowledge.<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: Neat ideas, woefully underexecuted. I like the idea of the secret lists that create more detail about things as time goes on - I would like to see trying to implement that in multiple ways, like for how missions and goals are constructed. The concept is great, and something I totally didn't see coming out of this name. Also, Monsters. I think the hook into this game is that you get to go fight Godzilla, right? Maybe monsters could be generated and maintained with an Eat Poo You Cat kind of list, where people add details without knowing what else is on the sheet, and successful character actions reveal those details. The whole conflict with existing Giants isn't nearly as interesting to me.<br/><br/><b>Atlantis 2037: Simulator Mode</b> by Tony Dowler<br/><br/>- You mention d10s early on, so I assume all "dice" are d10s, yes? I don't think it matters with the even/odd resolution, actually, but it's something that I paused on.<br/>- Under "Other Tests" - "The skill name in the test is appropriate" huh?<br/>- I like the cards, with their provisions for specific and general effects. They seem well-thought out and exciting to see how they are in play.<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: Seems cool! Seeing how it's a one-player game, I'd like to take an hour or two for a game when I can. I would be interested in seeing it modified to actually build the planet "map" as you play. I also see this as a multiple-person board game where you each take one of the crew members, and the Discoveries thing at the end would be the win condition. Right now, that's the most vestigial part of the game - like, I don't really care about making scientific hypothesis, I'm more excited about the sheer exploration.<br/><br/><b>Chained Souls: Work Out Your Own Salvation</b> by Timothy Monk<br/><br/>- So....are characters dead? Or not? (continued reading) Not. My bad.<br/>- Spirit - if you fill in 4 sections, then have 4 dice, do you put two dice on each unfilled section? Or only 1 die on each?<br/>- Chains - good technique, well chosen! I approve. I assume that I could claim someone else's Treasure as my Need (for example)<br/>- Solid Fortune-at-the-End "narrate a bunch of stuff, then roll some dice" model<br/>- So the Bible Verse thing only applies to verses that you gain from the Read the Bible action, right? If I have general Bible knowledge, I can't quote from memory?<br/>- So what do you use Spirit dice for?<br/>- It seems like shading in Spirit is bad, while shading in Soul is good? Or am I misunderstanding? Also, maybe call it Holy Spirit, cuz I keep forgetting which is which.<br/>- What is Body for?<br/>- Examples, please!<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: A potentially potent game that I think needs some more work. Some procedural elements aren't very clear, but the main problem for me is I don't understand what I'm playing towards. There's an implicit win condition (either gain Salvation, or fall pray to your Sin), but the text doesn't address this at all, either to detail it or to say that there is another goal for play. I'm looking for some structure to tell me when to stop playing. It doesn't need to be a per se win condition, but, like, do we play for some number of weeks? Do we play until one player hits a certain stage? Do we play until we're bored? That said, I can see some really interesting play the considers the nature of faith in the face of worldly influences coming out, especially with certain Chains (if I have a Need of sex, say, or a Treasure of political power).<br/><br/><b>City of Refuge</b> by Alex D.<br/><br/>- Ok, Post-Apocolyptic Planescape reference - I'm in.<br/>- I'm digging on the different stages of the game being coded by character development, rather than a meta-narrative of some kind.<br/>- Oh, there's a GM. What does he do?<br/>- What's the Spiritual stage of a Struggle?<br/>- How do you gain (or lose) Drives? I see where you can add to them to reroll dice when your Faceless, but what about Awakened characters?<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: Yes! Yes! Ye...ah.... I don't know if I'm totally missing something in the text, but where's the rules for actually gaining/losing Drives (which seems key to figuring out the Endgame)? If the game's been playtested (as it says in the designers notes) I assume that there's something going on that I'm not seeing, and I want to see it! The first part of the game is really sharp, a great distillation of various contemporary design techniques that seems to me to be really fun in play. Some examples would help, as always, and while I appreciate the sample locations and characters, I would love to see some kind of existing conflicts in the City that I could use to hook my character into, especially in the first part of the game. So much potential, but I don't think I could play this as written right now, unfortunately. <br/><br/><b>City of Refuge</b> by Ben Miller<br/><br/>- Bleak Ending Points - nice.<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: Unfortunately incomplete! I really like the premise, and I think the in-character-talking-only stuff has the potential to be really excellent. But the games just not complete.<br/><br/><b>Gear-Crazy: Giant Steam-Bots and the People Who Love Them</b> by Chris Perrin<br/><br/>- Good soonet!<br/>- I appreciate the overview of the structure.<br/>- Taking control of uncontrolled assets seems like it would make more sense to roll, and then you can put up to your Wins on it in Assets...<br/>- Does each noble get 10 favor? Or does each block get 10 favor?<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: A skeleton begging for some flesh. I like the narrative structure and I think the steam-bot/noble stuff is good. Assets, and dueling over them, is obviously at the heart of the game, and I think this needs to be pushed a little bit more. Maybe if each stage had it's own little win condition, and having specific assets had other cascading effects in the game? I think there needs to be something to tie the fictional assets into the mechanical structure in order for it to really work as a role-playing game. It also has potential to be a really neat board game, actually.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245263">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245263/#Comment_245263" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T11:37:28+00:00" title="December  5, 2009 11:37AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Hell 4 Leather</b> by Joe Prince<br/><br/>- Love the graphic<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: Nice, compact game. I would love some examples, of course, but it strikes me as one of those games that I'd just to have to sit down and play in order to find out of there's any procedural kinks. It strikes me as a good one-shot that would really respond to the players, as it's all about each players interpretation of the cards. All games benefit from groups that know each other well, of course, but this game is probably best suited for a close group, which I think means it also has potential for some really intense play. Good scope for the contest, well-imagined, probably needs some playtesting to reveal potential problem areas.<br/><br/><b>Hell For Leather</b> by Sebastian Hickey<br/><br/>- Right off the bat I'm impressed by sheer length, not gonna lie.<br/>- Ha! Rubber means eraser! Boy, I thought this was gonna be a different kind of game there for a second!<br/>- Checkpoint generation is good. Can the teams have the same checkpoints?<br/>- How do checkpoints work for co-op games?<br/>- Ah, there are Hunters! Probably could have mentioned this earlier.<br/>- I'm not clear on who has final scene-setting authority. <br/>- Very solid and specific guidelines for what to do in play.<br/>- Best guideline ever "You know when you decide there can't be any witnesses? Cue Felonies."<br/>- Even though you're on a team, calling in help for a specific situation make it less likely that your team will win in the end.<br/>- So you don't pick your target in the finale, it's always the person sitting across from you? Weak.<br/>- Check out Death Stakes, you're doing something similar with your endgame rules. Also, S/lay w/Me for dice towers.<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: This looks like a fun game that I have no interest in playing! Maybe that makes me a wuss. But, theme aside, the game is well-thought out and obviously playtested. The constraint is integrated well and passes the "gimmick" test (can I do this as easy or easier with dice? no). I wonder if it really needs to be a team game, it seems like it would work just as well if not better if everyone is just on their own. Maybe that could be an option (much like all players on one team are an option). If the pitch hooks you, I see no reason to get this puppy out on the table.<br/><br/><b>In Repose</b> by Mark Silcox<br/><br/>- Another "important a character from another game" idea - cool!<br/>- I'm always interested in everyone plays part of the same character stuff.<br/>- It would be nice to have a little definition of ID, EGO and SUPEREGO. I'm not as up on my Freud as I could be.<br/>- In the example the SUPEREGO crosses off entries from the list, is this a rule that you took out? Or should it be there?<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: This strikes me as more of an RPG poem or exercise, to warm up for an evening of play or break the ice with people you don't know well. I would worry about creative exhaustion (responding to a new item every round, building on what's already out there and going towards your goal between 11 and 16 times in a row), but I imagine that that's kind of the point, to get your brain working. I do suspect that even 11 rounds may be too much (thats 33 chunks of dream already). Depends on how tough the goals are to achieve. In any case, some playtesting would show where to finetune that balance.<br/><br/><b>In Repose</b> by Micah Bauer<br/><br/>- looks great<br/>- now thats some minimalist rules<br/><br/>Overall Impression: I smiled all the way through that. Again in the "RPG Poem/exercise" vein of things the way I tend to think about them, I see absolutely nothing but coolness coming out of this. Also, playtested! Just a sweet little gem of a game, and while I'm not a parent I can totally see where this is coming from. Well done.<br/><br/><b>The Piper at the Gates of Dawn</b> by Bill White<br/><br/>- Bill, and I say this with love, you are SUCH AN ACADEMIC<br/>- you are using words i don't understand, and i am pretty smart (metonymic?)<br/>- whats the difference between an attribute and a feature?<br/>- ah, so there's a GM<br/>- why would i choose to keep the difficulty level secret or public? personal preference?<br/>- why does the judge choose the notes? the categories seem pretty clear-cut, and it seems to me that it would be faster and more natural for each player to choose their own.<br/>- looks like some text got cut out. wierdness track? wrap around? wha?<br/>- whats the difference between the (+) and (-) on the characters intention card? are you supposed to strategize where you place tokens?<br/><br/>Overall Impression: There's a really good game in here, with some coaxing necessary to get it out. Reading it I get a strong sense of "playing this with Bill would be great, but I don't know if I could do it on my own." Some of the procedural stuff is pretty obtuse, and I would love a cheat sheet. The more fundamental problem I see is that this is dangerously close to what I consider overly mechanistic - there are a lot of procedures involved, but engaging with them takes so much effort that you forget to actually, y'know, roleplay. Sometimes these games would actually be better board games, but in this case I think some truly wierd and neat roleplay is in here. My bet is a lot of the mechanical interaction needs to be pared down. I really, really like the musical scale thing, but it may actually be a sacred cow....I'm not sure. And while this is all sounding really negative, that's because the fundamentals are very sound! There's a mindbendingly cool game in the middle here, somewhere. RELEASE IT!<br/><br/><b>Piper at the Gates of Dawn</b> by Steve Dempsey<br/><br/>- is the Lieutenant that you write down not drawn?<br/>- so you ideally want to save an NCO/Lieutenant, get decorated, and then survive until the end<br/><br/>Overall Impression: This sits in the poem/exercise category for me. At first blush I don't really get it, but I can see some interesting emergent effects as you try to narrate in the attributes of the other soldiers in order to get them killed off. I actually see this being the underlying system for a fun card game. <br/><br/><b>The Plant</b> by Jason Morningstar<br/><br/>- I like going down instead of up (you still reference Up in some places in the text tho)<br/>- I also like the extendible length of the game<br/>- 21 is great (I had to, I'm judging the game!)<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: I really like this game. Solid entry in the "single-player game" genre. Except for the one reference to a GM, I don't see any reason why this would be inaccessible to anyone who enjoys choose your own adventure. I think you could have gone the direction of asking an open-ended question with the endings, but it's not necessarily a stronger or weaker choice than the way you did go. Very sharp writing, well-thought out location descriptions and interactions. People should play this if they haven't had the chance!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245269/#Comment_245269" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T12:28:09+00:00" title="December  5, 2009 12:28PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations everyone <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I'm still a bit ashamed I didn't manage to turn in an entry this time around (for one reason and another) but I'm quite chuffed that one of my title suggestions found their way into two winning entries <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So to the winners, well done, to everyone else, you still did better than me if you entered something!<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245305/#Comment_245305" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T17:36:58+00:00" title="December  5, 2009  5:36PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2009 6:00PM by Sebastian.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well done everyone.

Essentially, whenever you act, there's a chance some drive or other grabs your soul. Which is why, as a player, when you act, make it mean something.<br/><br/>But it needs clarification still. What does "Pursue that drive" mean, for example? And some of the language is awkward. But, yeah, these 3-4 lines are a big gaping void.<br/><br/>There's about a paragraph of GM advice; I know it'd need more before being playable (or, certainly, easily playable) and examples of conflicts. Further, I don't think the game strictly needs a GM, especially since I was already rotating scene focus from player to player. Rotating GM-ship could probably fit in pretty easily; the main thing for the GM is describing the scenery, describing the NPCs and driving their interests, and saying what happens when a player fails a roll.<br/><br/>I'm now going to actually take the time to read over the comments on all the rest, but thanks to absolutely everyone who had a hand in this contest; from Nathan for running it, to everyone who offered prizes, to everyone who threw in names, and of course the other designers.<br/><br/>- Alex D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245308/#Comment_245308" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T18:24:57+00:00" title="December  5, 2009  6:24PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations to all the winners and to Sebastian for winning in the Best Horror/Dark/Violent game. <br/><br/>edit: Also, where can I read Chained Souls?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245309/#Comment_245309" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T18:40:17+00:00" title="December  5, 2009  6:40PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really looking forward to working with you George.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245322/#Comment_245322" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T22:33:45+00:00" title="December  5, 2009 10:33PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2009 11:10PM by timonkey.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan P.</cite><b>Chained Souls: Work Out Your Own Salvation</b>by Timothy Monk<br/><br/>- So....are characters dead?

Some procedural elements aren't very clear, but the main problem for me is I don't understand what I'm playing towards. There's an implicit win condition (either gain Salvation, or fall pray to your Sin), but the text doesn't address this at all, either to detail it or to say that there is another goal for play. I'm looking for some structure to tell me when to stop playing. It doesn't need to be a per se win condition, but, like, do we play for some number of weeks? Do we play until one player hits a certain stage? Do we play until we're bored? That said, I can see some really interesting play the considers the nature of faith in the face of worldly influences coming out, especially with certain Chains (if I have a Need of sex, say, or a Treasure of political power).</blockquote>\nThanks for the feedback.  I did this mostly as an exercise and had thought that I would just let the game sit, but now you've made me want work on it some more and do some playtesting (probably by Wave).  In response: <br/>- 1 die in each section of the spirit<br/>- I hadn't thought of having someone else's Treasure as my Need, but that sounds great.<br/>- The way I was thinking and wrote it you can only benefit from verses read in game, but I may want to change this now that you mention it.<br/>- When you would put a die into spirit but it's already full, then you can put that die on any chain or part of the soul.  This somehow disappeared from the text.<br/>- Every reference to spirit in the text that is not a quotation from the Bible refers to the human spirit.<br/>- Shading spirit is bad, shading the soul is good.  I thought about pre-shading the soul during genesis, but that seemed odd at the time.<br/>- Body is for nothing mechanically, it's only there because you have one.<br/>- I probably should set some end condition.  Although, the game is about an ongoing process that doesn't necessarily end in our lifetime, so this may be a chronic problem.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/northerain">@northerain</a> and any other interested parties: let me know your email address and I'll send you a copy after I alter a few things mentioned here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245349">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245349/#Comment_245349" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T08:23:14+00:00" title="December  6, 2009  8:23AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huge thanks to Nathan for running such a well-conceived and inspiring contest!<br/><br/>If anyone would like a free copy of my modest (but prize-winning!) offering IN REPOSE ("The Game of Lucid Dreaming and Freudian Fun!"), just drop me an e-mail at mark dot silcox at att dot net.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245350/#Comment_245350" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T08:28:35+00:00" title="December  6, 2009  8:28AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Nathan P.</cite><b>Hell 4 Leather</b>by Joe Prince<br/><br/>.<br/>- In the example the SUPEREGO crosses off entries from the list, is this a rule that you took out?

My eternal apologies to Joe, and my feedback is here. <br/><br/><b>Gear Crazy: Giant Steam Bots (and the people who love them)</b> by Joe Jeskiewicz<br/><br/>- Neat title font<br/>- I see Jumping and Swimming on the character sheet - I hope there's rules for drowning and falling!<br/>- Good color, I like the whimsical/serious juxtaposition<br/>- The weapon chart seems kinda blah, cuz it's a flat linear progression. At the extremes there's a bad weapon to avoid or a good weapon to take, and in the middle all the weapons are mechanically the same. I don't see anything other than cost that would give any reason not to get the Defoliant (or Fire, if Defoliant actually only works against organic matter, which I don't see called out specifically). For my taste I would like to see each size category having an effect on the weapons that are good for it - like, maybe the buzzsaw does more damage at high levels b/c its so big, while the steam thing is more effective for medium sized  and fire is pretty much the same throughout. Then at least you'll see different weapons depending on different robot sizes. <br/>- I don't understand how combat works. In the first example it looks like the defenders dice cancel out the attackers as long as they're higher. In the second example, the cancel out when they're lower, and where did all of the attackers other dice go?<br/>- The Harvesters are great.<br/>- Oooooh, maps. Especially on the interior ones, are the squares the same size as the combat grid squares? Cuz that would mean that any steambot larger than 3 can't fit. Or is there some scale (like, when combat starts each of those turns into a 4x4 square area, or something?)<br/><br/>Overall Impressions: Lots of cool ideas here, but I need to know more about how the game is actually supposed to be played. Is this an adventure game? A board game? Dungeon crawl? Is the GM supposed to go through the provided adventure as written, or is more an example of how to make an adventure? Is it episodic? How many players? And so on. Also, I don't understand the core damage mechanic. However, I appreciate all the effort that went into the fiddly bits, and I see a lot of potential there. As noted above I think weapons could be jiggered to be more interesting (and I feel like more options could be added - more weapons!) This is also one of those cases where the roleplaying component isn't really there as written, and a decision needs to be made whether this is actually a board game with some cool narrative backstory, or a roleplaying game, in which case there needs to be more character-stuff to get me to care about making some fiction. In either case, I think with the addition of some higher-level structure there's a good game in here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245356/#Comment_245356" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T08:51:32+00:00" title="December  6, 2009  8:51AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mark,<br/><br/>I'm glad you found it inspiring!\n<blockquote>The crossing out of entries does fit in - remember, the ID player gives the SUPEREGO player a list of twenty items to use in the dream, but the superego player will only have to use a max of sixteen of them<br/><br/>I do see your point about the length of the game.

That means that in order to "hit the right note" you've got to role-play. It's a <i>license</i> to <b>play your character</b>, since if you want to be sure you almost have to ham it up.\n<blockquote>Overall Impression: There's a really good game in here, with some coaxing necessary to get it out. Reading it I get a strong sense of "playing this with Bill would be great, but I don't know if I could do it on my own." Some of the procedural stuff is pretty obtuse, and I would love a cheat sheet. <b>The more fundamental problem I see is that this is dangerously close to what I consider overly mechanistic</b> - there are a lot of procedures involved, but engaging with them takes so much effort that you forget to actually, y'know, roleplay. Sometimes these games would actually be better board games, but in this case I think some truly wierd and neat roleplay is in here. My bet is a lot of the mechanical interaction needs to be pared down. I really, really like the musical scale thing, but it may actually be a sacred cow....I'm not sure. And while this is all sounding really negative, that's because the fundamentals are very sound! There's a mindbendingly cool game in the middle here, somewhere. RELEASE IT!</blockquote>\nThis is a thing I'm experimenting with, trying to make the mechanics drive role-playing. The usual approach to make a game more RP-intensive is to move away from the game-mechanical and be more free-form; this is what jeep does. But another approach that's not much tried is to shuttle rapidly back and forth between the game-mechanical and the in-game: set up an interaction, play it out, use the output of play as input to the next interaction. Boom boom boom. What makes that work is that you're clearly either in the fiction or at the table: acting in-character or acting as-a-player. Done right, I think you walk away with a strong sense of character.<br/><br/>The musical scale thing is neat, and resonates thematically with the title, but maybe it's too precious. But some cycle of deciding what to do, playing it out, and reaping metaplot-level rewards on the basis of how other players interpret your playing-out is the heart of the system. Everything else is scaffolding to let that work.
