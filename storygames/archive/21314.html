There are veiled threats and hints of opportunity!  We said some charming and clever things!  We told some strategic lies!  This NPC seems like someone we might befriend!  Or kill!  We're loving this!</i><br/><br/>Ten minutes later:<br/><br/><i>Is he gonna tell us anything useful or not?  Did we get anything useful already?  What was it?  Is there something we're missing?  Is there something else we should try?  Should we trust this NPC?  Plan to kill them?  How do we know?  We hate this.</i><br/><br/>There's an obvious solution to the less fun part: get certainty from the game system.  Engage a procedure that forces a die or the GM to tell you, "Here!  Look!  This!  This is the important thing, and here's how it is, and now you have to respond to that!"<br/><br/>A fine solution.  But not a universal solution.  In my experience, although a good game procedure often avoids the no-fun part, it also often discourages the super-fun part.  Because why work and struggle and strive to master the fiction from within the fiction if you can push a game button to move forward?  I'm not saying a useful dice procedure discourages roleplaying -- but I do think it changes the roleplaying.  And I'm loathe to lose the no-rules version.<br/><br/>So!  Here's my thought of the moment.  The problem in freeform challenges is ambiguity.  Can we provide in-fiction tools to remove that?<br/><br/>For example: what if player characters (or one player character per party) can read minds just the right amount?  Like, maybe they can spot lies.  So now you roleplay a conversation where you try to get the NPC to provide answers to telling questions.  The effort is entirely in-character, but the feedback is no longer as ambiguous.<br/><br/>What do you think?  Any other ideas for giving players concrete info without an extra-fictional procedure providing that?<br/><br/>I had another idea where players could propose a theory and then probe for things to confirm/deny, or account for what they've already seen to confirm/deny.  So there'd be a game procedure -- "propose a theory!" -- but it would be more of a way to organize the conversation than to inject stuff into it from without.  Inspired by <a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a> 's success with Petitioner/Granter, which I quite like, but I want a tool that's less vulnerable to being forgotten or superseded by existing habits.<br/><br/>I also thought about "formal rule as back-up only", where you hope that roleplay will get you there, but if the ambiguity is too frustrating, you can fall back on some Read a Person-type thing that'd say, "Here's one actionable answer.  You now have the option to be done."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466812/#Comment_466812" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-06T02:57:59+00:00" title="October  6, 2017  2:57AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One of the great conundrums of roleplaying, isn't it?<br/><br/>I've seen a few solutions along the lines of what you're suggesting, from the GM side:<br/><br/>* When you feel like the players aren't making progress, or the NPC has spilled the beans, just announce that. "He looks like he's prepared to keep talking about the same thing over and over, if you want. Are you done with him, or do you want to try something else?"<br/><br/>* The "mind reader" technique doesn't necessarily need fictional plausibility. Ever since reading Vincent's advice, which is, basically, "When an NPC is lying, say so," I've pretty much always applied it, and it's never hurt a game. Basically, I look at the players, and if I have any inkling they might not have caught on (by my portrayal, which I try to make obvious, but don't always succeed), I straight-up tell them, "It's obvious s/he's lying/hiding something."<br/><br/>I've also thought about reworking the "Read a Person" move or something like it into a more fiction-tangible thing, though - i.e. one where you still need to play out the interaction in detail to get some traction of the move. I haven't done that yet, however. Some day!<br/><br/>In any case, I'd love to see some better techniques/advice on this front, just like you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466814/#Comment_466814" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-06T04:15:28+00:00" title="October  6, 2017  4:15AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's a GM thing to nudge when player nudging is needed.

Maybe strive to design something pushing the boundary as much as possible. Support and encourage with various tricks and procedures first-person play-acting, while making it not mandatory, all wrapped in a structure that still pushed gameable outcomes to the fore.<br/>(easier said than done! <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> )                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466819/#Comment_466819" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-06T08:33:07+00:00" title="October  6, 2017  8:33AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my theory on this, at least in the context of narrativist games: the fictional detail exists to provide visceral realism in the moment. This visceral realism - or "color", as we used to say - is then leveraged into climatic moments of play by asking players to make meaningful choices on the basis of essentially nothing but that visceral impression. Game mechanics are utilized to provide those choices in a succinct and reliable manner, before the visceral impressions have a chance to fade.<br/><br/>If a game leads [free play] -&gt; [good buzz] -&gt; [dice rolls], then it's not doing it correctly, because the dice rolls, precisely as David describes, do not actually do anything with the strong fictive nuance you've generated. You need to go [free play] -&gt; [good buzz] -&gt; [important choices] -&gt; [consequences] -&gt; [dice rolls]; this way the black-box-we-call-the-player gets its chance to do its thing: react viscerally to their impression of what's going on, thus precipitating consequences which often imply dice rolls.<br/><br/>Notably, to get from the viscerally powerful roleplaying to the choice-making, you need a robust system of play. This has nothing to do with the dicing part, generally speaking; this is something that happens before. It sort of answers David's questions about the structural meaning of the scene: you need to have some sort of a system that tells the players what to focus on as a pivotal question in the scene.<br/><br/>This systemic element does not need to be super-duper complex, but it can be. One of the simplest ways to get from the free play and visceral impressions of the scene to the important issues is for the GM to ask questions. A well-placed "OK, so are you going to trust them or not?" does wonders to focus play and contextualize a moment of free play for the players. They get directly to making the choice.<br/><br/>So I guess I've got two ideas for David: the first one is to not start your conflict resolution things before the players have actually made important choices. The second one is to ensure that you've got <i>something</i> in there that actually contextualizes the free play so that the players eventually get to those choices. The default option in the history of rpg texts is a chairmanning GM: you the GM know what the dramatic purpose of scene is, what its stakes are, so you can ask the players to consider that same issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466839/#Comment_466839" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-06T17:06:10+00:00" title="October  6, 2017  5:06PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2017 8:40PM by DeReel.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The feeling of ambiguity posited in your first post echoes strongly with what David Simon says about the work in Baltimore's homicide brigade.

( I suspect that is closer to what David is getting at here, as well. )</p></div></blockquote>\nMy theory of what goes on in old school D&amp;D is that it's "organic task-based short-loop conflict development/resolution". That is to say: what you do while playing D&amp;D is that you establish a situation and then evolve it step-by-step over certain semi-fixed points of uncertainty, reading the dice and asking the players for input, until you end up with a resolved situation. Certain mechanics, such as hitpoints, are there to help you reach a resolution.<br/><br/>The visceral color has an important role in this process, but it's different from what you'd find in a narrativist drama game: rather than the color contributing to the gut instincts the players use in making choices, the color contributes by suggesting directions of development and potential mechanical and procedural hooking points for the GM. The players are reading the color as well, of course, and there are all sorts of mechanics where they utilize the color in the same way the GM does.<br/><br/>The color in both of those game types comes from the same place, the "automatic writing" that the play group engages in while doing free play. For example, the GM playing the NPC is basing their portrayal on certain facts in their prep, but the significant facts for play are not in that prep, but rather in what the GM is inspired to portray on its basis. If the GM feels that this NPC should be fearful, for instance, then via that portrayal this additional factor enters the organic portrayal of the scene. It then becomes a potential hook for further developments - a player would be justified in expecting a bonus to their intimidation attempt on its basis, for instance. So everybody is sitting up and paying attention when the fiction is being established, because basically playing the game simply consists of paying attention and noticing these little details that you can leverage once they get established. That's why you ask the GM clarifying questions, too, to establish facts that you can use.<br/><br/>On this basis, I think that the solution to David's problem in old school D&amp;D is to chairman play vigorously: the GM can ask the players to act, or to wait for him to act. There's no reason for the scene to go on and on until the eternity. Meanwhile the fact that the players may or may not have figured out the pivotal, important elements of the scene is entirely up to them: the GM is not responsible, and it is in fact a central interest of play to see what the players got out of that scene. Did they decide that they can trust this NPC? Did they decide that they hate him and will want to betray him? Did he tell them something important? My players constantly miss important things and attach to unimportant ones. That's life in D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I guess that I ultimately don't think that there's a problem here for old school D&amp;D GMs, because the game is ideologically committed to not giving a fuck if the players get confused and lost. If the players catch on they get to seize initiative and make smart plans, and if they remain clueless, they get to react to the events as they occur.<br/><br/>This does, of course, mean that the players are the guys who should be caring about the fictional ambiguity a great deal in play. For them I have some specific instructions: stay aware of what you're trying to accomplish, pay attention to the useful details and add your own, don't try to play cute with the roleplaying (ask straight questions, speak clearly of your own intentions), go to the dice when the risk/reward ratios are in your favour.

The opposite problem. What happens when freeform roleplay happens in the absence of clear game mechanics.<br/>The ideal results are somewhere in between these two extremes, I would guess, as I see the same advice Eero provides being equally applicable to whom play-acts too little or too much.<br/><br/>This leads me to believe that in both cases the crux of the problem is <b>effort</b>.<br/>In both cases the problem is that the Players are not engaged with the fiction as a solid reality.<br/>On the one hand they almost ignore it in favor of dice and rules, as a way to find something clear and solid they can interact with in a predictable way.<br/>On the other hand they almost ignore it in favor of superficial elements, colour, posturing, as if by immersing in the LOOK of things then they will be how they hope/expect them to be.<br/><br/>In both cases no one is stopping to THINK.<br/>One way you just crunch numbers, the other way you just improvise an accent, and no one engages with the real puzzle: to imagine a situation as a problem to be solved and the take appropriate actions to influence it.<br/>This is a puzzle. This takes effort, brain power. And most people shy away from it on the account that when they PLAY they somehow expect the activity to put their brain to rest, to relax, to escape.<br/><br/>And you can have a STORY without necessarily facing this kind of effort.<br/>And you can have a fight, a tactical game, a resource management game, without necessarily facing this kind of effort.<br/>And you can immerse yourself in a role, escape to another world, have a social experience, without necessarily facing this kind of effort.<br/><br/>This actually resonate with the <b>MDA game theory</b>, now that I say this out loud.<br/>Mmm...<br/>Time to think more about it, and get deeper into it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466876/#Comment_466876" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-08T00:43:03+00:00" title="October  8, 2017 12:43AM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 8, 2017 12:43AM by Mongrel_GM.">edited October 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a> when players just don't want to put a lot of effort into getting info, but the game requires a lot of effort, isn't it just a poor pairing of game and desired aesthetics?

(e.g. One character is always criticizing the actions of another, while a third is embarassed by their fighting, but none of the three try to change this dynamic in any way.)<br/><br/>If I'm that kind of player, of course I don't have "meaningful goals" in a conversation with an NPC. I'm just portraying the character's "voice" while I wait for the GM to lead me to the next scene.<br/><br/>I've seen this kind of thing a lot. It's, perhaps, the main reason why playing a strong player-guided narrativist game can be incredibly frustrating with a bunch of "experienced gamers" (if "experienced gamer", in this case, means someone who has been conditioned to play this way).<br/><br/>You'll notice that advice for players in this style of game is never about "having strong character goals", how to create a character which puts you in a strong position along a moral line, or similar things, but, rather, always a list of tricks for how to inhabit a persona and to make them consistent and memorable.

This kind of rule will be  paid lip service to and, more often than not, will in fact left on the side of the road during play. A limb with no sap is a dead log.

Or for Players to do the same straight-question-to-straight-answer conversion.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you can totally make even mind-reading obscure. Like, the reading only nets you flashes, emotional impressions, bits and pieces. Very suggestive. Maybe even useful if the Player is perceptive and clever. But definitely not "clear" :P<br/>It doesn't solve the problem of Players failing their <b>real-life perception roll</b>, thus going on fruitlessly play-acting without truly communicating clear information.<br/><br/>Also, from FateLess experience, purely in-fiction input can NEVER be trusted.

Those phrases, though spoken in-character by an NPC, carry an OOC meaning as well.<br/><br/>"Let Me Clarify" is actually the only one in use in the Accelerant system, that I know of.
