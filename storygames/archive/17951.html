So how would one create a character who <i>starts off</i> with sorcerous powers or items? The rules specifically discourage making them part of character generation:<blockquote>When making abilities, don\u2019t make overt magical powers like \u201cFireball\u201d or \u201cBlack Magic\u201d. Instead, make abilities that tell us how your character knows the ancient secrets they will use in the game. Abilities like \u201cStygian Adept\u201d...</blockquote>It seems like the best I can do is to start my sorcerous character off with no powers, but then leap on the first object encountered during play and do a Lore roll on it: "Aha, I perceive that this dusty stick lying in the middle of the road is made of wyrdwood, and my Stygian training allows me to shoot magic missiles from it, PEW PEW PEW!"<br/><br/>This is \u2026 unsatisfying.

The facts you create establish that the spell is possible. For example, you can establish that you know a ritual phrase that controls a particular creature, or you can summon a demon that lives in this particular area, or you can call down lightning from this violent storm. Spells are always specific to a particular time, a particular creature or person, or a particular place.</blockquote>\nThis sounds good, although it's slightly at variance with the core rules (since the Lore roll isn't necessarily about a newly appearing thing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406067/#Comment_406067" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-12T18:39:21+00:00" title="February 12, 2013  6:39PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is no variance between core rules and play-aid! It's at the time a new thing (place, time, character, creature, item) is introduced that you make your Lore roll to find out what you "already know" about it \u2014 including whether you know any magical spells which affect it.<br/>Maybe the tricky piece of language in the play-aid is "If you want to cast a spell, start with a Lore roll": this may be tricking you into thinking that you can make the decision you want to "cast a spell" at any time? And, consequently, that you may roll for Lore about an already established thing? Then rephrase as such: "The act of casting a spell always begins with a Lore roll", or even: "Your opportunity to cast magical spells in a given scene is one of the things you establish via Lore rolls". Unless you brought it up as a fact when succeeding at a Lore roll, you don't have the leverage to perform magic.<br/>In other words, when you make your character "a sorcerer" in OMT that just means your character is very knowledgeable about things \u2014 occult and unusual things especially.<br/>Another way to think about it is that there are no magical "spells" in OMT at all \u2014 not in the usual RPG fashion.

This is more creative.<br/><br/>But it seems pretty restrictive to allow magic to be introduced only in regard to new items in a scene. Let's say we're in a crypt and notice a locked door with cryptic runes on it, but walk past it without investigating because we're following the blood-trail of a wounded Ythrak. Later, on our way back, we pass that door again. Now that we have time, I'd like to try to decipher those runes, maybe by knowing that runic alphabet or having a spell of translation. But according to the rules, <i>the runes aren't a new item</i>, so I can't make a lore roll, so I can't use my sorcery on them.<br/><br/>Obviously the GM can hand-wave this obstacle away, maybe saying that "the runes are new to you because you didn't have a chance to look at them closely on your first pass by", but I'd still like to know what the intent of the game is for this situation, and how people have dealt with it in actual play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406406/#Comment_406406" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T14:41:02+00:00" title="February 16, 2013  2:41PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Obviously the GM can hand-wave this obstacle away, maybe saying that "the runes are new to you because you didn't have a chance to look at them closely on your first pass by", but I'd still like to know what the intent of the game is for this situation, and how people have dealt with it in actual play.</blockquote>\nThis is how I play it, and it works perfectly. The Lore roll is for when you are "first" encountering something, which is usually best interpreted when it becomes an object of focus. This doesn't have to be "USE IT ABSOLUTELY IMMEDIATELY OR YOU LOSE THE CHANCE!" Usually, as in the examples in the text (or when first encountering a monster, etc.) you'll want to roll right right away, but there are plenty of times when it is better to be a bit more flexible. Your example of the runes, actually, sounds unproblematic to me-- this is exactly the time to let the characters roll Lore after the current excitement is over and when they come back and focus on the runes. <br/><br/>The spirit of "when first encountered" is that lore cannot be retroactively activated to help situations later or to automatically get you out of a present danger; it is meant to open up new possibilities of play <i>in the future</i>, not to be a resource from the past upon which are character draws to get out of a present danger. So it's fine to delay the roll until the players return to the runes, for example, but not if they later disingenuously say, "Oh, remember those runes on the door? Well, actually, I know something about them... (rolls and adds facts that help get out of the current spot)."<br/><br/>The way to incorporate sorcerous powers from the beginning is to strongly follow the advice to tie it back to the the character's history. "Oh, that's a Serpent of Amon-Ra. They have an incredibly sensitive sense of smell, so if we burn these doruk roots I got from the Merchant in Ammon then the pungent smoke should mask our smell and let us sneak by!" That sort of thing. Sorcery isn't powers you've already got, it's the ability to discern truths about occult or arcane things and thereby to gain leverage <i>in this situation</i>. Everything, including spells, has to be tied directly to something in the world: an item, a person or type of creature, a place, a certain day, etc. Magic is situational; you don't just get a wooden stick that can *pew pew* magic missiles at whoever you want whenever you want-- instead, you heard from a wander minstrel about a magic wand that can be crafted only under a new moon on midsummer's night from a yew tree beside a certain enchanted stream in the heart of the forest. See? Instant lore about the world which opens up future courses of action, not that merely historically justifies a way of getting you out of a present spot.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406433">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406433/#Comment_406433" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-16T23:10:26+00:00" title="February 16, 2013 11:10PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafu and Stephen nailed it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ATXrds" title="ATXrds"><img alt="ATXrds" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ATXrds">ATXrds</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406559/#Comment_406559" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T20:51:35+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  8:51PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Snej, I thought I'd give you my view on magic.  Because I'm running OMT w/ my kids and I'm aiming for less pulp (like the D&amp;D novels in the 80s or Dragonlance) I do have magic a bit more defined.  With lore checks right now I'm also giving them options on facts/prompts.  They're getting it pretty quick though.<br/><br/>Anyway, I let the Wizard use her D10 (Elven Wizard of the Deep) with Warrior skill (D4) to represent her casting a bolt of magical energy or a fireball or a mass of webs or a sleep spell or a cage of fire etc.  It makes a difference in the story and I encourage her to think of different spells or ways of using the spell; eg using a telekinetic bolt to knock down a statue on 2 two mooks (when she rolled a 6).  The only restriction I've given is that she must have her staff and be free to gesture.  <br/><br/>The tricky thing is utility spells like Invisibility, Knock, Fly, Teleport, Create Food.  In one sense I'm happy to let them open doors and levitate things as color and coolness of the character without requiring rolls.  I do have a general rule that magic has an equal/opposite reaction.  For every fact they add, I offer a balance of another fact and negotiate.  For example, casting invisibility, she rolls an 8; chooses I'm invisible, my ally is invisible, and no one else can hear us.  I offer these facts, invisibility is lost if you attack, it will otherwise last for one hour, the strain of the spell prevents you from casting again till you rest.<br/><br/>Perhaps if your players pick up sticks and ascribe magic talents (this stick makes me invulnerable or lets me fly through walls) you may also add your own facts not just to gimp them but to hopefully generate a more compelling story?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett" title="JLHBurnett"><img alt="JLHBurnett" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/722/nB1X4KGH4YFEW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JLHBurnett">JLHBurnett</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407062/#Comment_407062" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-23T23:21:07+00:00" title="February 23, 2013 11:21PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 24, 2013 1:17PM by JLHBurnett.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just bought OMT tonight, read through it, then read through this thread.

Gandalf makes a lore check "Ah... I know the secret speech of the Elder Pines and can whisper these pine cones into explosive fire!"<br/><br/>Gandalf and company are running from a Balrog. Gandalf makes his Lore roll with his "Keeper of the Secret Fire" ability. "Ah... a demon of the Outer Dark. I call upon the authority of Eru!
