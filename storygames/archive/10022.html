Basically, an anime take on various cultures, with a deep fantasy Vein.<br/><br/>I've promoted the idea of using art books (for video games, modern artists, etc) for game background material, but this is the first time my eyes did that "jump out of my head" thing; clammy hands, cold sweat, that feeling of "I *MUST* buy this".<br/><br/>So on a recent trip to Japan, my wife picked up some art books (CG design mags, game/manga art collections, etc) for an artist friend. One of them, my fave of the bunch is the Illustrated <b>Monster Hunter</b> book.<br/><br/><b>Monster Hunter</b> is the new hotness over in Japan. It was one of the first PS2 games to make use of the PS2 Internet interface that that system had. Huge amounts of subscribers, tons of content, for a game which amounts to an MMO where you team up with 1-3 strangers and shoot/kill monsters for loot. Since then, it came out for PS2 (again, several versions of escalating content), PSP, Wii even. It's now up there in the realm of "Killer Soft", like the Final Fantasies, Dragon Quests, Zeldas, etc.<br/><br/>So like many games that start with concept sketches, there's been a recent release of Monster Hunter illustrations in a fat book (a single set of 2 books actually; one color, one B&amp;W; the color one is better).<br/><br/>Basically, it's 240 pages long, and many of the pages (about 1/3?) is all character concept art. And well over half of those are high concept character art for african-themed, aztec-themed, inuit-themed, etc fantasy characters.<br/><br/>Here's the book review from Parkablogs:<br/><a href="http://parkablogs.com/content/book-review-monster-hunter-illustrations" rel="nofollow">http://parkablogs.com/content/book-review-monster-hunter-illustrations</a><br/><br/>Just a few samples:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3303/3423368776_b1496fec80.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3357/3422561631_1ef3891091.jpg"/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3569/3422562243_96539d000b.jpg"/><br/><br/>And here's a link to a flickr flip-through of the book:<br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/teohyc/3422556891/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/teohyc/3422556891/</a><br/><br/>Lots of Monsters (of course) and swords and stuff, but yeah fully 1/3 of that book is character sketches, most of them wildly multicultural, and cool while keeping a firm leg in that culture.<br/><br/>But yeah, I flipped through this book myself, and in just a few dozen pages saw about 20 mulicultural-themed characters that I Wanted To Be, Right Fucking Now. So, I guess this an endorsement?<br/><br/>I looked around for online stores, you might be able to find a cheaper place to buy it online, but here's one link (basically cost of $35, plus $20 for sea mail):<br/><a href="http://www.hlj.com/product/CAP33179" rel="nofollow">http://www.hlj.com/product/CAP33179</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222493/#Comment_222493" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T14:28:04+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  2:28PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Monster Hunter book is one of my favorites.  Awesome character art, Awesome armor, Awesome weapons, and Awesome dragons.  It's definitely something I reference a lot for fantasy games.<br/><br/>It's also a great co-op online game on the PS2, with short 15-1 hour missions, which is easier to get into as a busy person than massive quests.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_222498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222498/#Comment_222498" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T15:03:43+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  3:03PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's currently out-of-stock at HLJ, but they've ordered more. <a href="http://www.jlist.com/PRODUCT/PHS786" rel="nofollow">J-List</a> has two copies left, but it's $48 before shipping, from Japan.<br/><br/>Looking around for more places.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_222518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/222518/#Comment_222518" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-04T16:26:08+00:00" title="August  4, 2009  4:26PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Books Kinokuniya had copies both in Seattle and San Francisco, if you're ever out on the West Coast (I think they have a store in New York too...)<br/><br/>Jade Cocoon and Mark of the Kri were two other games that had distinctive non-Euro fantasy art, though I don't know if either ended up with art books.
