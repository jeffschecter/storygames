Let us know how it goes! My suggestions:<br/><br/>- 3-4 players (not including GM) is an ideal size. Allow for 1 hour of play time for every player (not including GM).<br/><br/>- Split the party. More than 2 Dogs in a conflict is almost a guarantee win. Have Relationships ask to speak to a PC alone. Have an NPC seduce someone. Have an NPC ask to confess their sins in private. Have obvious problems explode at the same time in different parts of town... a mob over there... a fire over here... a gunshot down there... a hanging up there! <br/><br/>- If the Dogs gang up on someone who is obviously going to lose, Give and keep your highest unused die for a followup conflict. Be clear about what you are doing and why. Lead by example and encourage the players to do the same. <br/><br/>- Populate the Town with the PC's Relationships or have the PCs pick Relationships from a list of predetermined NPCs or have them leave most of their Relationships undefined. Encourage PCs to share Relationships.<br/><br/>- A Raise is something the defender can't easily ignore. It's not enough to just push dice forward. I like to illustrate this by including NPCs that are not of the faith. The Dogs often use Traits like "I'm a watchdog of the faith" but if they use that on NPCs not of the faith, I will be clear that they don't care and they will need to Raise with something else. Be strict but remember this works both ways. Anyone can say "I don't buy that", even to you.<br/><br/>- Taking The Blow maters in the fiction, not just in Fallout. Tell the person Taking The Blow to show us how. How does it hurt them? How does it change them? Show us. Some people slip into describing Taking The Blow like any other See. It's not. And if the person doesn't actually want to Take The Blow... tell them to bring in more Traits, Give, or Escalate. Don't let them off the hook. <br/><br/>- What is at Stake in Dogs conflicts doesn't work like Stakes in other games. Side don't have Stakes. There is just what is at Stake in the conflict. Whoever wins gets to say what happens with what is at Stake. And even if a side wins, if you want different things to happen you can keep fighting each other to decide an ultimate winner. <br/><br/>- What happens inside a conflict matters. Individual Raises can put something small at Stake related to the overall conflict. If what is at Stake overall is "does Jack kill Bob" then a mini Stake of a Raise could be "do I take Jack's gun". Raises and Sees aren't just about pushing dice around. Make the fiction matter so when someone eventually wins the conflict, everything that happened before informs the resolution of what is at Stake. In many ways, even if you lose a conflict, the individual Raises you won could be small concessions or compromises. <br/><br/>- Just like Raises is something the defender can't easily ignore, Raises should also be something that helps you win what is at Stake in the conflict. Ask yourself... will this help me win this specific conflict? If not, revise. <br/><br/>- Tie Fallout to the fiction. Players have a lot of Fallout options and it's tempting to take the easy way out. If the easy way out is appropriate... great! If not, ask the players to explain their choices. Why did you take a new d4 Relationships that may never come into play instead of changing the die size of an existing trait or lowering a stat? Ask them to make it relevant to the blows they took. I'll make recommendations... if you use a Trait, Gear, Relationship or Stat in a conflict, it's a good choice for being changed by Fallout. <br/> <br/>- I like to give players the option to rewrite Traits when they change their Trait dice due to Fallout to account for fictional changes. "Qucikdraw" could become "Quickdraw except when my family watches." <br/><br/>- I like to go all the way to murder for the first town and avoid anything obviously supernatural. <br/><br/>- Don't skip Initiations. I also love to reincorporate ideas, moments, and characters from the initiation scenes later on. <br/><br/>- Dogs love to blame the Steward! When making your town, use this!<br/><br/>- I like to make the Steward especially difficult to judge but not overly cooperative. "After your gone, I'm the one that has to pick up the pieces." "Are you 100% sure they're to blame? Because if you shoot them... they will be 100% dead." <br/><br/>- In Dogs your job is to judge not to find clues. In a clue finding game, you make it fun by hiding clues behind dangers, puzzles, and more clues. How do you make a game about judgment fun and challenging? First make it clear that among the Faith, what the Dogs say goes. But if 2 Dogs disagree... who is right? I like to bring this up a lot and point out how Dogs disagreeing is common. Second I fill the town with good people doing bad things for good reasons or bad people doing good things for bad reasons. Twist it! Make judgment hard and then get out of the way!<br/><br/>- Related to making judgment hard, I like to make the main bad guys reactions to the real problems... not the cause!<br/><br/>- Give players responsibility. Have the Steward quit and declare one of the Dogs the new Steward. Have a dying parent ask the Dogs to take care of their children. Have someone ask the Dogs to forgive them. Have someone give the Dogs power of attorney over their crucial business deals that affect the entire town. Have someone ask the Dogs to marry them. Give the Dogs responsibilities and tie them to the town's fate!<br/><br/>- If the Dogs are too calm and you want to stir something up... have someone question the faith or the Dog's authority. Have someone claim they can do a better job than the Dogs. Have someone with a gun claim the only thing that separates them from the Dogs is their pretty coats. <br/><br/>Rock,<br/>John                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277277/#Comment_277277" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T08:52:50+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  8:52AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If my one time GMing Dogs can help, don't choose a topic to which you have deep seated personal beliefs on (e.g. women's rights).

I remembered another thing.<br/><br/>The game doesn't really care that much about things that happened to the Dogs before they became Dogs. Having a complex backstory for your character and a whole bunch of unresolved issues doesn't often pay off the way it does in other games. It's totally fine to say "I'm playing just a regular guy from a regular town." Small things go a long way, like I played a character once who was from a really small town with a very loving and supportive family. He loved the faith, and really believed that love and compassion could solve any problem. That's all I really knew about him. Two towns in he was shooting people to death. It was awesome!<br/><br/>Sometimes I see people starting play with these carefully constructed characters with heaps of backstory and complicated issues and unresolved problems, and I think that they're going to be unsatisfied with how that turns out in play. Your character is going to change, probably fast, and oftentimes in ways you don't expect. Sometimes all that backstory will feel irrelevant or cumbersome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277446/#Comment_277446" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T07:18:37+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  7:18AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roy</cite>Wow...thanks everyone, especially jenskot for your advice.

Just one or two defining characteristics for each is fine (even if it's "I carry a big gun")--you don't need to overthink this or worry about it. They'll develop in play plenty!<br/>* Make your NPCs, as often as possible, not rational, collected people, but passionate, desperate folks on the edge of despair, madness, torn by love--and the Dogs are their only remaining hope. Escalate early and escalate often--just do it and see where it leads!<br/><br/>The main thing I find important about Dogs is this:<br/><br/>Establish as early as you can that the game is not an adversarial one. What I mean is: yeah, the characters are at each other's throats, for sure, but you, as the GM, should make it as clear as possible that you're not "against" the players, and vice-versa. Show it to them in play, all the time:<br/><br/>* Your NPC just made some strong, strong move? Lean over to the player, look at their dice, and give them some ideas on what they could do that might be cool. Help them do what they want to do. Every time you do this, it reminds them that, while there's all this intense conflict going on in the game, as players and people you are all working together.<br/>* Cheer them on when they succeed or do something cool! Also cheer them on when they fail in cool ways. How do I mean? The best way is to show them, first:<br/>* Take advantage of your opportunities to Take the Blow. Each time you do, it's an opportunity to do something cool and dramatic. On top of that, you're showing them how their actions have impact. Don't hold back. For instance, if a Dog throws a punch in the middle of the conversation, describe how their opponent falls through the window and out into the street. <br/>* Same with Fallout: lead by example. After a conflict, declare you're using the Fallout to give the NPC a relationship with the Dog: "She's taking a d4 relationship with you. She's pissed, steaming, but as she turns to leave, you're pretty sure her cheeks are red from blushing, not just anger. She's never been talked down like that before!"<br/><br/>I feel it's important for the players do realize that, despite all the conflict in the game, the *players* and the GM are not adversaries to each other--you're making this cool fiction together. And that encourages them to have fun with Taking the Blow, losing conflicts, and showing how Fallout changes their character. At first, they might be scared of "losing", and use their Experience to increase their Stats, but they'll quickly see how much more fun it is to create little complication or express things we didn't know about your character, instead.<br/><br/>(If you want to simplify the rules for yourself as the GM, also, I recommend using <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=294" rel="nofollow">these</a> simplified NPC rules.

How to handle relationships/how to make them work. <br/><br/>I always feel like I need to come up with some way to make these go before we play: John (jenskot) makes little pictures of the NPCs in the upcoming Town and then has players assign relationships to them, I've had players write up NPCs first as relationships, and then used them to create Towns...<br/><br/>Many people want to write relationships as Traits: "Steward Harger taught my how to shoot" -- and then roll those dice in a shooting conflict.<br/><br/>2. How to deal with larger conflicts, either with many PCs or with many NPCs.<br/><br/>Do you roll dice for multiple NPCs within a conflict? (Vincent says no, and I agree, but I'm pretty sure it's not specified in the book.)<br/><br/>How do you balance conflicts, to make sure they remain interesting, when you can have a range from one PC versus the NPC dice to four PCs acting in concert against the same dice? (John has told me that he usually preps his players by telling them something like: "This game won't be terribly fun or interesting if you all act together and agree on everything.")<br/><br/>In a larger conflict, how do you handle elements of escalation, or people wanting to join a conflict under way? (For instance, in a larger situation, like a bunch of Dogs against a mob, keeping track of arenas is tricky: in my most recent game, we had a gunfight within which a Dog cornered an NPC without a gun and told him to stand down--is that an escalation to talking? If you have four NPCs with guns, do you roll dice for four guns, or just for one, as a possession of the group NPC? Etc.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277474">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277474/#Comment_277474" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T08:57:59+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  8:57AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roy,<br/>\n  One thing I have had trouble with is selling it as "wild west Mormonism that never was."

Use this book to play on player's newly minted hypocrisy and mine the book [of life] for plot ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283718/#Comment_283718" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-30T12:00:00+00:00" title="July 30, 2010 12:00PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>Regarding player knowledge of the religion, remember that what the players say is always true.  One gimmick might be to find a book and remove its dust jacket.  Then tuck a sheet of blank paper in between the pages in the middle of the book.
