I particularly enjoyed shaping the system to the requirements of the game...<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, each of the 16 pre-gens had a 'Folly': this was a personalised replacement for the cliches, so that each character had at least one tremendously stupid action they could perform that earned them a Survival point. These included things like stealing something important, telling a stupid lie, inciting someone to violence and starting an argument with the partner you depend on.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, when a group of characters ventured out together into a dangerous situation, it was predetermined that there would be some real danger. So, I asked for a player to volunteer to make a rol, such as Escape or Defend; if they failed, they lost a Survival point, but if they succeeded, they got to narrate the circumstances by which anyone in the group lost a point! It was amazing how often they were nice to each other and didn't pick on the most vulnerable PC...<br/>\n<br/>\nThird, in the finale, when some of the PCs had escaped and some had remained behind, I took in all the character sheets, marked all those who escaped with an 'E' in the corner, then shuffled them and had someone pick one at random. They were told that the group who survived were the ones who were not picked; as it happened, an 'E' character was drawn, so all the escaped PCs were given a oda in which they died, but all the ones who stayed in Tesco's lived to see the Mist lifting!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
