From Initial D, and Rush, to even Mad Max - I'm always finding myself needing a solid and fun racing system. Not too technical, but enough where your car matters, and something that can emulate that intense feeling of high speed driving. Anyone have any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436130/#Comment_436130" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T17:50:33+00:00" title="July 31, 2014  5:50PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2014 4:05AM by AsIf.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the "700 Horsepower" campaign run by Alexander Williams aka <a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">@SquidLord</a> we played "<a href="http://www.twohourwargames.com/maderainwa.html" rel="nofollow">Machinas</a>" from TwoHourWargames.

What I have done is to use the abstracted speed as a modifier to rolls. I have used it in few different systems like GURPS, Savage Worlds and a Polish RPG - Neuroshima. Any system where you can apply modifiers works for that.<br/><br/>You choose your speed rating, let's say 4. If you need to avoid obstacle, take a tight turn or shoot the traffic lights you take a -4 to your rolls. It also means that if someone wants to shoot at you or ram you they also take a -4 roll. At the end of the turn you get a number of points equal to your speed (or some number (vechicle grade or something) + your speed). Race to let's say 40 points (or get over 15 points against the other guy to loose him).<br/><br/>I kinda improvised the rest. Like drawn cards for each "leg" of the race to see if there is any obstacle etc.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
