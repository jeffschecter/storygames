I was thinking <i>Lady Blackbird</i>, at first, and I put the word out via Twitter.  At first, it was looking like I'd only have two players, so I switched plans to <i>GHOST/ECHO</i> (I just really want a full cast for <i>Lady Blackbird</i>).  As it turned out, by the time we were ready to get going, I had five players anyway.  Everybody was digging the idea of <i>GHOST/ECHO</i>, so we stuck with that.<br/><br/>Much to my surprise, our take on the setting ended up disregarding the sci-fi/paranormal themes of the game document completely.  Instead, we played in an early-1980s retrofuture dystopian British surveillance state, inspired by the likes of <i>1984</i> and <i>Brazil</i>.  No really crazy technology was in evidence, beyond mini-zeppelin UAVs and compressed-air guns that fired capsules of unpleasant substances.<br/><br/>Our Ghost World was just the parts of the city that weren't covered by surveillance devices--the slums, the lawless rookeries, the maintenance tunnels beneath everything--as well as the criminal underworld that lived in those places.  Wraiths, naturally, were the paramilitary security teams--all jackboots and gas masks--who invaded the Ghost World to keep the have-nots in line (Dogs being the rank-and-file footsoldier Wraiths, with notably snout-like masks).  Paper was defined as identity documentation, needed to pass from one sector of the city to another (or, more specifically, the blank certificates one could use to forge such documentation).  Stones were mostly theorized to be some kind of drug, while Metal was probably weapons or other illegal hardware, but this heist was about Paper.<br/><br/>We never defined Echoes.  They just never came up, which I'm totally fine with.<br/><br/>Coil was a rather principled Indian wrestler, tattooed with a constrictor snake.  Demon was a drug-fueled maniac with metal teeth and poor impulse control.  Hull was an 18-year-old girl who hacked security systems.  Grip was an androgynous (but probably male) sneak thief with a penchant for flowery Victorian overcoats.  And Vixen was a weasely ex-corporate with an unfortunate surname who fell into the Ghost World when his coworkers out-backstabbed him.<br/><br/>And, man, the whole game ran beautifully.  I resisted the urge to start drifting it by allowing multiple advantage dice, and it turned out that it was all calibrated just about perfectly the way it was.  There was a great tension to every roll, which rose steadily as the characters accumulated injuries and dangers.  I just sat back and conducted the situation in the most obvious of directions, while the dice and the players' wonderful danger suggestions ensured things got complicated and interesting very quickly.  In the end, the Crew escaped the Wraiths, battered and bleeding and covered in filth, and with just half the Loot.  In my book, that's an ideal "pilot episode"-type ending, and all the players are looking forward to more.<br/><br/>Fantastic work, John Harper!  I hope we'll get to try out <i>Lady Blackbird</i>, soon.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_293259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293259/#Comment_293259" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-13T16:28:33+00:00" title="September 13, 2010  4:28PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.
