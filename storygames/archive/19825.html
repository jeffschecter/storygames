The game suggests that the game master should tell the players which skills to pick to match the adventure and, at the end of the book, the game master got a sheet for checking off the player's investigator skills.<br/><br/>So it's merely an adventure building tool dressed up as skills.<br/><br/>Again, another reason why I don't understand the spends in Gumshoe.\n<blockquote>(A side project for me is creating a really diceless version of Gumshoe, but I'm finding some issues with granularity--I mean, the first thing to do is put Investigative and General skills on the same scale, but then you get into some "how to differentiate stuff" at that coarse a grain.)</blockquote>\nDo you need to have General skills?

Given that the central mechanic of Gumshoe is resource management, and the default mode of play is somewhat pulpy, then yes--I think there's a place to track the ability of the PCs to overcome rather conventional opposition, like the guy coming in the door with a gun.<br/><br/>My main theory on how to build the diceless version was to start with the assumption that any General spend less than 3 points is suboptimal and use that to put General and Investigative skills on the same scale. That would only be the start; I think there's a need to prune the skill list a bit, and there's some question as to what the granularity of the system would look like once that's done, especially combat. But I think it's got some legs.<br/><br/>The other thing I'd probably do the next time I run Gumshoe even if I use the conventional rules is dump the idea of Stability tests and just charge a flat rate. ("You were in a gunfight; everyone knock off a point of Stability.") It's my experience that players tend to get annoyed when they're asked to make the roll, and there's a long pause as people try to calculate the optimal spend. (It's an expected payoff calculation and usually straightforward but it can get a bit hairy on Mythos tests.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439823/#Comment_439823" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-30T21:40:21+00:00" title="October 30, 2014  9:40PM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 31, 2014 1:41PM by Rickard.">edited October 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If I remember correctly, that skill list thing works in both directions.

It taste good because I use the ingredients as they should be used to create totally new dishes.\n<blockquote>My main theory on how to build the diceless version was to start with the assumption that any General spend less than 3 points is suboptimal and use that to put General and Investigative skills on the same scale. That would only be the start; I think there's a need to prune the skill list a bit, and there's some question as to what the granularity of the system would look like once that's done, especially combat. But I think it's got some legs.</blockquote>\nI believe you need to think from a different perspective. Right now, you're really focused on obstacles in roleplaying games. I made and played a pulp game that is basically diceless, and where the characters succeed all the time. What was interesting in that game during conflicts where the consequences of their actions.<br/><br/>It feels like you're trying to use fake chicken instead of other ingredients the right way. You can't just remove something and try to replace it with something else. It will in 98 % of the times taste bad. Try other ingredients instead and use them as they are intended to.<br/><br/>That's my experience anyway. Both in cooking and in game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439828/#Comment_439828" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-10-31T01:51:48+00:00" title="October 31, 2014  1:51AM">October 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just throwing this in there: in my observation (from reading various GUMSHOE games), Investigative abilities are there to establish information and facts.

I've often considered letting the Investigative Ability uses guide me in improvising the way forward, but I've never actually tried it.  If I did, I probably wouldn't bother with the spine and core clues at all; I'd just have some vague idea of the monsters and forces and schemes in play, and follow the players' lead.  I'm not sure how to mix the two, and if I did what I just described, I'd encounter the usual dangers of things not adding up or making sense at some point (dangers I can avoid, but not without some strain that I don't often enjoy).  So I'm really curious to know what you did and how it turned out.<br/><br/>Separately, I've been wondering if I've been assuming and encouraging the wrong player attitude for this genre all along.  In Lovecraft stories, the protagonists don't make meaningful decisions.  They follow the horrors as far as they can until they're ultimately presented with a solution or an escape or a grim demise, and then that's what happens.  A GM simply putting on a show for the audience is not a bad model for this, as long as the audience chimes in with reactions from skepticism -&gt; curiosity -&gt; obsession -&gt; horror -&gt;madness.  In this respect, tracking Sanity mechanically actually takes the key player decisions -- namely, those of portrayal -- out of the players' hands somewhat.<br/><br/>I think it's this tension between "watch a performance that's like reading a Lovecraft story" and "play a solid game that has Lovecraft color but is really nothing at all like reading a Lovecraft story" that makes the genre such endless fodder for reinterpretation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439844">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/arscott" title="arscott"><img alt="arscott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/arscott">arscott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439844/#Comment_439844" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-01T01:22:06+00:00" title="November  1, 2014  1:22AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David:  That's an absolutely fantastic observation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439880/#Comment_439880" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-04T04:04:57+00:00" title="November  4, 2014  4:04AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It is a fantastic observation, and I think it goes well beyond Cthulhu.

(OK, sometimes they ask me to spell out what a clue means. But generally I try to make spends create something new.)<br/><br/>My current method for avoiding lack of consistency in the scenario is to prepare a minimal set of facts or pieces of evidence (I organise them by attaching them to specific NPCs and locations) that the GM has a veto over. <br/>"Ah, I recognise this as the kind of pottery made in Alexandria!" "Memphis, actually." "I mean Memphis!"\u3000<br/>The danger is then that anything I <i>don't</i> retain control over is seen as inessential to the plot - so it's important to work the facts the players create into an advantage or, as you suggest, a new lead to as-yet unrevealed information. <br/><br/>This works most seamlessly player and GM meet one another halfway. <br/>E.g. The investigators find the pottery. Instead of making a straight-out declaration about it, the player declares their PC knows how to get the answer - "I'm more of a Mesopotamian pottery expert, but my colleague Doctor Herz will be able to tell us more."/"I have just the book to consult about this, at home on my desk."<br/><br/><br/>FWIW, I agree with Rickard's comment regarding guessing. Despite the creators' repeated assertions that spending points before a roll creates tension (and that doing so afterwards, or knowing the target number, doesn't), that simply isn't true, in isolation. You need other information - without knowing the risks, it's not tension but helplessness.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_439957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Addicted2aa" title="Addicted2aa"><img alt="Addicted2aa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Addicted2aa">Addicted2aa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439957/#Comment_439957" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-05T15:59:53+00:00" title="November  5, 2014  3:59PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> You need other information - without knowing the risks, it's not tension but helplessness.<br/></blockquote>\nSo I don't think I follow you. You have some information about why you're rolling. Perhaps you know exactly what your are rolling against or perhaps you just have the all the game prior up to this roll, but that's still information.<br/><br/>I see it as poker. The majority of the time you know the probability that a card will come up to help you, but not the probability a card will come that will actually let you beat your opponent, because you don't know what they have. You have some information, but not all information. Furthermore, you don't know what effect your action will have on your opponent.<br/><br/>That's not a helpless situation. It's not a situation without meaningful choice. It's definitely a tense moment, when deciding whether to call, bet, check, whatever.<br/><br/>Even when a player goes all in pre-flop, in texas holdem, you still have some information. Your choice to call or not is a tense moment.<br/><br/>How is that different from a GM telling you to roll, whether for a specific known action, or even as a reaction without telling you what you are reacting to? Yes, you don't know the exact number you need, but you have a clue, based on everything that's happened up to this point and how the difficulty system in the game works. You even know generally what's at stake, your ability to continue the story without obstacle. It seems to me that it is still a way of creating tension.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439977/#Comment_439977" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-06T00:42:05+00:00" title="November  6, 2014 12:42AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my long experience of playing and running GUMSHOE, the tension seems to be pretty much the same whether you tell players the difficulty level of a check or not, especially after a bit of play.

The tension comes from the fiction. <br/></blockquote>\nThat's my experience too. <br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Addicted2aa">@Addicted2aa</a>: I'm not sure what you're disagreeing with. <br/><br/>The authors of GUMSHOE have claimed on their podcast and elsewhere that spending before the roll and not knowing the target number create tension <i>in themselves</i>. I don't think that's true, and it seems you agree. <br/><br/>I'm not saying that hidden target numbers and pre-roll spending <i>diminish</i> tension - they don't. Just that if you don't have a meaningful choice, for whatever reason, then it's not tense.* As you point out, generally speaking, you do have that information - at least a rough idea. If you literally have no idea, there's no tension. <br/><br/>There are (at least) two kinds of non-tense decision: arbitrary and no-brainer. <br/>I was once a player in a military SF game where we were given the momentous decision of whether to take the path that went up the ridge or away into the hills. We pressed the GM for more details. There were none in this barren landscape. We asked if our military training suggested one as better than the other. He said no. We picked the ridge (I think). It was arbitrary. The game was awful. <br/><br/>The no-brainer appears in a complaint often levelled at the boardgame <i>Talisman</i>. As fun as the game can be because of its flavour, the gameplay is boring because you always have two options and one of them is almost always obviously better than the other. (This is the critique I remember; it's been ages since I played the game so I can't say how fair it is - I'm just using it as an example.)<br/><br/>So to set up an interesting General Ability roll in GUMSHOE, you need to hit somewhere in the middle ground between those two. <br/>If you <b>know</b> that you'll never have to roll Athletics again in this adventure, you might as well blow all your points on this roll. Too easy. <br/>If you genuinely have no idea whether you'll need Athletics again later, nor what will happen if you fail this one roll, then it's arbitrary. Pick a number at random. (This situation is much rarer in GUMSHOE - as you say, you usually have a general feel for where things are going.)<br/>You need to be between the two: if you suspect another Athletics roll later might be more important, or if you feel this roll is vital (to avoid a falling block of masonry, say), <i>then</i> it's tense. <br/><br/><br/>"You even know generally what's at stake, your ability to continue the story without obstacle. It seems to me that it is still a way of creating tension."<br/>This knowledge of the need for the story to go on is one reason I am broadly in favour of post-roll spending for General Abilities in GUMSHOE, at least in pulp-style games. The decision then becomes "do I accept a setback now, or will it be worse to fail later?"<br/>Philip Marlowe tends to get sapped early on but start winning fights later. <br/><br/>*This is one reason I don't like dream sequences in <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> scenarios, incidentally.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_439996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/439996/#Comment_439996" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-06T10:42:17+00:00" title="November  6, 2014 10:42AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most tense GUMSHOE game is NBA.
