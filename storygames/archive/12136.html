There are a few D10 and 2D10 thrown in for good measure, but the system is very manageable (all of combat can be summarized on a spreadsheet one page large). The ease of the system ties in with the world, so that you are not confined by the rules, but rather it acts like an interface between you (player) and you (character). For instance there is a system to help you check what your character might know of a "world subject" ("What exactly is a XXX-creature anyway?") or remember, as he/she is he/she all the time, and you only play once a week and forget about stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing about the game can be bulleted into three.<br/>\n1. Everyone and anyone can do magic.<br/>\nIn a fantasy setting where it is "a magical world" (like Tolkien's LotR, D&amp;D; or any of those) it is so strange that only a handful of people actually DO magic, and they are all in robes and have silly hats. This is a world where magic is taught as part of your professional training, as it is as much a part of the world as any tool you can carry in your bag.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. There are living gods.<br/>\nNot empty churches with monks and priests, and not big monster-gods you can kill to get a lot of loot, but real caring deities that pay attention to your actions, and while they will not punish or reward you directly, they will grant your prayers depending on how well you follow their commandments and how much you pay attention. 9 religions are outlined in the Core rulebook along with its system and a "bible"-text to explain them each.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Humans make better badguys.<br/>\nWe've seen Willow. and Bond for that matter. Humans are just as good as badguys as monsters, and easier to relate to than "The thing from outer space". The game therefore puts a focus on the human races of the Second People, leaving the other races and the big monsters to later publications (so the trolls and some big snakes snuck into the core rules when we were not looking, but the principal is still maintained).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271801/#Comment_271801" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-18T06:32:25+00:00" title="May 18, 2010  6:32AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, the setting seems interesting, but honestly, it sounds like I can play it with many of the other systems on my shelf.

I know it sounds like a cliche, but that is the feedback the system has gotten.<br/>\nThe world is evolved, rich and detailed, and while only a part of that information is in the Core rulebook (due to constrains on space, noone wants a 1200-page rulebook for a new game) it is enough to start the journey. The focus is heavy on the human races of the Second People, leaving the others in obscurity to peek out at later dates, when you are more settled in this new world.<br/>\nThe rule-system supports this, acting as an interface between your character and the player behind it, and is not separate from the world. This is something that a lot of other games suffer for; trying to be generic enough to be adaptable to other worlds and other settings, and thus making it equally bad at everything. This system is for this world, this setting, and works really well for it. That's what it is here to do, after all, not handle space-mutants.<br/>\nThe system handles actions, combat and experience the best, allowing for fast-paced combat where a single die decides fate, while at the same time being balanced enough to keep you interested regardless of the odds.<br/>\nUnique aspects of this game is its dual magic-system (Lower and Higher), along with its rules for religions, prayers and faith, which I have not seen done well in any major game. These systems work, they are part of the world and telling in how a story goes.<br/>\nEach adventure we bring out brings not only the story itself, but a miniature expansion in itself, providing more background material, new rules and new settings, not just for that adventure, but to be incorporated in your future play. Another key point to this is that there is nothing in the adventures that the NPCs can do that the players cannot do. No more "he casts a spell you don't know, can't match and can't counter because he is the main NPC badguy". If the NPCs can do it - so can the characters. It is only fair that the world not operate on different rules depending on who you are, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271952/#Comment_271952" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T04:15:24+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  4:15AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mean Dungeons of Dragons, for fantasy systems, no?

Certainly some more than others, but that's what happens when you grow to be popular I guess; people emulate you.<br/>\nThis game is not am emulation of the D&amp;D; system. If anything it draws inspiration from the Basic Roleplaying system (which was popular in the late 70s and early 80s). However, during playtesting several refinements have been made to make this system run as smoothly as possible, with as few breaking rules as possible. 14 versions later and we are at a point where the game runs really really well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jprussell" title="jprussell"><img alt="jprussell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jprussell">jprussell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271961/#Comment_271961" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T05:45:11+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  5:45AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not to be a jerk, but I'd say it's a <i>bit</i> of an overstatement to say that every single fantasy setting is a copy of LoTR.

Limitations in system breeds either inaccuracies in the game ("Hm... but the stories say I should be able to do this...") or discrepancies in progression.<br/>\nI do appreciate the veiled "we don't take kindly to that kind of talk around here, mister"-reference though.<br/>\n<br/>\njprussell - I think that a few of the games I played using BRP had sort of the right "feel" for it. I mean, the rules are, in my opinion, not to be crucial part of the game, they are there to aid the story and resolve things that can't be RPed easily. That's what the rules are there for I think.<br/>\nThese rules will cover the things that you as a gamemaster will most likely need help to keep consistent and fair; combat, movement, damage, experience, magic and divinity. The system covers a few special situations like falling, drowning, fire, poisons and so on, so that you don't have to re-invent the wheel each time someone gets bit by a poisoned snake, gets choked by a muscular snake or falls off a really big snake.<br/>\nRules cannot cover everything of course, but the current system seems to be holding up under "normal" gaming, and provides solutions for when it does not cover it as well. The system itself, being based on a single roll (D100) is easy to learn, remember and "wing" if you get into trouble, unlike say WoD-systems where any "winging" quickly turns into a "but last time he got so-and-so, I want that roll too!"-whines.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272160/#Comment_272160" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-20T01:24:11+00:00" title="May 20, 2010  1:24AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the reason I asked for which systems you're well-versed in, well, partially is what was mentioned above: Which systems informed your design.

What is your game about?**<br/>\nLost Roads of Lociam is about living in the world. There is no pre-determined arc of the story, I leave that up to the gamemaster. There are certainly themes, like order vs chaos, first people vs second people, living vs undead, but you don\u2019t HAVE to get involved in any of these. You could just as well play fishermen. It is all up to the gamemaster<br/>\n<br/>\n2.) What do the characters do?**<br/>\nSee 1. I do not determine what the gamemaster puts before the character. It might be epic plots of courtly intrigue, classic dungeon-crawling or wilderness-survival, doing good deeds for the local village, I would not know. It is up the gamemaster. I merely provide a ruleaset to allow for these situations to be resolved, and a setting in which they can take them happen.<br/>\n<br/>\n3.) What do the players (including the GM if there is one) do?**<br/>\nIt is a very flaky question to be honest. The players play their characters, interacting with eachother and the world, which the gamemaster provides them.<br/>\n<br/>\n4.) How does your setting (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?<br/>\nThe rules are tied to the setting, and they reinforce eachother. There is nothing in the world that is not covered in one way or another by a rule on the core rulebook. No, it is not micro-management, just a try to be comprehensive. The gamemaster can of course decide not to use any/all rules, and just use the setting, or vice versa. Again, not my call as a designer. I just make the thing and people can use it as they see fit. \uf04a<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n5.) How does the Character Creation of your game reinforce what your game is about?<br/>\nThis, again, comes down to the gamemaster. If you use the standard creation process then you can be pretty much anything; a stone-age (technology-vise) hunter/gatherer, a noble (brother to the king no less) of a powerful kingdom, a knight, a magician, a priest in one of the churches, or anything in between. Using dice to determine a lot of outset factors, and then choice to determine the rest, a group can be highly eclectic, which of course makes it interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n6.) What types of behaviors/styles of play does your game reward (and punish if necessary)?<br/>\nActive play is encouraged. The adventures are geared towards proactive play, rather than reactive, at least as far as completing tasks and getting experience is concerned.<br/>\n<br/>\n7.) How are behaviors and styles of play rewarded or punished in your game?<br/>\nMaking good plans, roleplaying and competing tasks are rewarded by experience-points, both general points that can be distributed freely, and also those tied to specific skills. There is no \u201cnegative\u201d version of experience, so at least you can\u2019t get \u201cworse\u201d.<br/>\nIf you follow the tenets of your faith you will rise in the eye of your deity, which is a good thing. If you continually snub your nose at the commandments of your chose deity then eventually he/she/it will turns his/her/its back to you and not listen to you anymore. I guess that\u2019s a punishment, but it also allows for a character to \u201cswitch\u201d faith.<br/>\n<br/>\n8.) How are the responsibilities of narration and credibility divided in your game?<br/>\nThere is no mechanic for this in the game. If a gamemaster wants the players to dictate narrative flow then eh/she is free to do so, and if he/she wants to handfeed the players with everything except a yes/no input as to \u201cwant to enter the door?\u201d then he is free to do so too. The game itself does not dictate this one way or the other.<br/>\n<br/>\n9.) What does your game do to command the players' attention, engagement, and participation? (i.e. What does the game do to make them care?)<br/>\nNo, that\u2019s, again, the gamemaster\u2019s job. The game only provides a setting for fun and adventure. If the gamemaster wants the character to sit around being bored he/she can of course do so.<br/>\n<br/>\n10.) What are the resolution mechanics of your game like?<br/>\nThey are based on the D100 Basic roleplay system, where tasks have a chance to succeed towards which you roll 1D100 to see if you manage it or not. It is straightforward and consistent throughout the entire system.<br/>\n<br/>\n11.) How do the resolution mechanics reinforce what your game is about?<br/>\nSince the system is internally consistent and affect player characters and non-player characters in exactly the same way and under the exact same circumstances, it reinforces that you are part of a world, not a tourist (like you are in D&amp;D; where the mechanics for player characters and monsters are WILDLY different).<br/>\n<br/>\n12.) Do characters in your game advance? If so, how?<br/>\nCharacters advance through experience-point either general ones to be distributed freely (as given as general rewards for completing tasks and good roleplaying and such) but also specific ones for skills. If you use a skill you get better at it, just like in real life.<br/>\nYou can also gain in favour in the eyes of your god if you fulfil the commandments and do good deeds.<br/>\n<br/>\n13.) How does the character advancement (or lack thereof) reinforce what your game is about?<br/>\nJust like in life; knowledge is power, and experience makes you better. Characters who play and adventure can undertake more difficult tasks. Such it is in real life, and so it is in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n14.) What sort of product or effect do you want your game to produce in or for the players?<br/>\nIf they can feel they are experiencing and interact with a new and novel world then my work is done. A lot of work has gone into making the world \u201cfeel\u201d special, and not just Tolkien in a new hat.<br/>\n<br/>\n15.) What areas of your game receive extra attention and color? Why?<br/>\nEmphasis has been placed on areas where Lost Roads of Lociam differ substantially from a lot of other fantasy adventure game; its rules on magic and the chapter on religions. These two set a lot of tone and therefore get a bit more space.<br/>\n<br/>\n16.) Which part of your game are you most excited about or interested in? Why?<br/>\nSee 15.<br/>\n<br/>\n17.) Where does your game take the players that other games can\u2019t, don\u2019t, or won\u2019t?<br/>\nLost Roads of Lociam is a new world, something new to discover and experience, and has not been seen before. The challenges are different, the tools for completing those tasks are at the same time familiar and new, and the world in which you travel lends itself to exploration and learning.<br/>\n<br/>\n18.) What are your publishing goals for your game?<br/>\nNone. I just want people to enjoy it. If one person plays it once and has a good time it would be more than enough.<br/>\n<br/>\n19.) Who is your target audience?<br/>\nI wrote this game because it is the game I would like to buy and play. I just hope others find it enjoyable, or at least use it as a base for further exploration. I have not targeted anyone specifically, but I guess it caters more to the roleplayer than tabletop-player, and more to the adventurer than the \u201cmood-player\u201d (if they even exist anymore, maybe that was just the early 90s).<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that\u2019s those 19.<br/>\nI hope they answer some of your questions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_282293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282293/#Comment_282293" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-22T04:10:33+00:00" title="July 22, 2010  4:10AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Rasmus, that was really helpful for me.  <br><br>Could you expand on how magic is handled?

The effects are suitably bigger, of course. Fireballs and the likes.<br/>\nMechanically lower magic is truly very simple, with a straight chance and that decreases if you are hurt, and if you are attempting things that are truly \u201cbeyond\u201d your natural magical talent.<br/>\nHigher magic is a bit more complicated, but then allows for a bit more \u201cfun stuff\u201d like cheating, speeding things up, conserving power, storing effects and so on and so forth.<br/>\n<br/>\n2.\tPrayers are handled through a roll + modification to beat a difficulty (to make it slightly different from skills). The modifications are things like your standing with the god, how much time you spent on your prayer, your offering (if any), pledges, and so on. If you beat the difficulty you get your prayer come true, and if you don\u2019t then\u2026 well. Gods are fickle things it seems.<br/>\n3.\tThat all depends on the religion of course. Some are lax about that sort of thing, while others have more stringent rules to adhere to. Most religions in the core rulebook are very benign, community-buildings things, so \u201ccherish your community, fight chaos and decay of soul, protect the weak\u201d and such commandments are more common than \u201ckill all read-hired people, eat babies on the Sabbath\u201d and things like that. If the characters adhere to the \u201ccommandments\u201d then they will steadily rise in favour with their god. If they don\u2019t then they will most likely remain where they are, or slide down.<br/>\n4.\tGods do not clash with gods. Followers clash, but no, making rules for what a god cold do to another god would be out of scope for this game I think. This isn\u2019t D&amp;D; 6: Immortal (remember the golden box?)<br/>\n<br/>\nI got the coupons by the way, so to those that messaged me I will send you those codes, and if anyone else is interested, there are still some to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
