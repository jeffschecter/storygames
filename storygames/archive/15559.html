The Instant Set-up Fiasco Super Hack<br/><br/>1. Assemble your brave souls (3-6 players) and distribute many tiny slips of paper or little index cards.<br/>2. Discuss the setting you're playing in. Keep it vague or make it precise, ain't no thing (i.e. a contemporary gaming convention; a college town in the 1920s US; a shady forest grove inhabited by graceful, sentient badgers).<br/>3. Demand that each player write at least 2 (in a 3-player game we did 3 -JF) relationships, object, locations, and needs (one per card or slip of paper please). Fold and place said pieces of paper in four different (labeled) cups, one for each type. Keep these at the precise level in Fiasco, for example instead of listing something as 'sexual object' write instead 'furry costume' or instead of 'rivals' say 'internet rivals who haven't met IRL.' (I stole ideas from existing playsets and just tweaked them a bit. "Need to get laid by hot elf." etc. -JF)<br/>4. Draw cards by rotating around the table one at a time, and place them between two players. If you get one that sucks, suck it up and roll with it. (We did a draw-two choose-one thing in our game. I see the appeal of both ways. -JF) Make sure you draw at least one location, object, and need. Once that minimum has been met, feel free to mix the locations, objects, and needs into a stylish hat to randomize the final selection(s). <br/>5. Play as normal, with two white and two black dice for each player in the center. The epilogues and tilt work as normal, just use the preset ones in the book.<br/>6. Have a Freeasco!<br/><br/>It's that simple, and ideal if there's a setting you want to play that somehow hasn't had a playset made for it yet. <br/><br/>A couple AP:<br/><a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/13501841?thread=13501841" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/13501841?thread=13501841</a><br/><a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/18866182/0#62725252" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/18866182/0#62725252</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352671/#Comment_352671" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T21:57:55+00:00" title="December 28, 2011  9:57PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Caroline is wicked clever.<br/><br/>I told Jason about this after GPNW and he screamed "achhh!

Although for some reason I wrote really boring things on my allotment of cards? Anyway, we looked around at what we had and discarded the least interesting, rather than "sucking it up". I think the only reason you can discard a card should be because it is boring. <br/><br/>Also, it didn't take longer than the normal set up, which I found surprising. I think some time savings occurs when you are simply drawing instead of choosing, so I am wary of Jamie's "draw two, pick one" approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352729/#Comment_352729" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-29T11:51:43+00:00" title="December 29, 2011 11:51AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I forgot to mention, for the hell of it with our Bad Santa Photographer game we gave every relationship two details (need &amp; object, etc) so there were two of each type of detial and they all got play - put a little more meat on a three player game.<br/><br/>Even with draw-2-pick-1 our setup went very quick - the slowest part was writing the elements in the first place.
