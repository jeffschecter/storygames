So when I heard about <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1448841122/kingdom-a-pen-and-paper-space-exploration-rpg" rel="nofollow">Kingdom: A Pen &amp; Paper Space Exploration RPG</a>, my interest was instantly drawn.<br/><br/>This was in a post by someone who thought the idea of a space ferret rpg was a good one. After looking at the kickstarter for this project, I didn't think it seemed that great...just another sci-fi heartbreaker. Since it wasn't what I was expecting, I made what I had hoped it would have been.<br/><br/>I've been playing with the idea of Pocketmod games for the last couple of months and decided to make something with some modern sensibilities, and a couple of fun twists that reflect the way we know ferrets to be. They're playful, adventurous, often fearless, very sociable creatures, but their often misunderstood by the wider community. The perfect animal subjects for a game.<br/><br/>The game play is pretty standard, d10 based and is designed to be simple enough for kids to pick up pretty easily (or for the mechanisms to blend into the background while gamers get into telling some good stories). Roll under attribute and the effect succeeds, roll over and some kind of fallout happens. Every die roll produces some kind of story effect. But Ferrets are moody creatures, sometimes loving, sometimes confrontational, sometimes free-wheeling anarchists, and at other times carefully cunning. The innovation in the game comes from the reflection of these moods on the rolls. If a ferret is in an instinctive frame of mind, they'll gain a bonus to running around and performing crazy stunts, but they'll suffer a penalty when they try to carefully do something. I basically pulled the idea from Michtim, and tweaked it into something that works in a pocketmod game.<br/><br/>Because I believe in the cause, 50% of the games profits will be sent to the <a href="http://www.ferret.org.au/" rel="nofollow">NSW Ferret Welfare Society</a> (which my wife and I are both members of). I'm pretty happy that the game has sat in the top 10 over on RPGNow since it was released, the first donation to the society will be made shortly.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/109516/Tooth-and-Claw" rel="nofollow">Have a look at it, it's only a dollar. </a><br/><br/>If you have any questions, I'm happy to answer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_406498">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zydake" title="zydake"><img alt="zydake" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nAK5WMQP5MDFD.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zydake">zydake</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406498/#Comment_406498" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-18T06:00:03+00:00" title="February 18, 2013  6:00AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Always nice to see people can be inspired by other games!
