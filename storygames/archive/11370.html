It's a game I've returned in my thoughts right through the year (and in here, sorry about that <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>. Something ticked; all the players knew what the game was about, the discussions were lively after the games. And now I'm thinking if this could be a pattern that I could try to reproduce.<br/><br/>There are many global news stories capturing the attention of the global population each year. Last year it was the Gaza, the downturn of the economy, Obama, Afghanistan was and is still in the limelight, the climate talks in Copenhagen etc.<br/><br/>For me <b>playing story games about these news stories would be a way to understand and to explore viewpoints of the narrative that we consume through media</b>. I personally often have hard time grasping the systemic view of these kinds of events through news. Instead I feel some kind of anxiety and frustration and the need to go on with other things. But I think something valuable could be learned by exploring these news events through story games.<br/><br/>So I ask you: <b>What recent news events would you want to play a game about?</b> What would you like to explore?<br/><br/>Or <b>you can suggest a game to use for a game about a recent news event</b>. How would you set it up?<br/><br/>Any general thoughts on story games about news events are also welcome. We can branch out if this thread becomes a mess.<br/><br/><i>Ps.

The people living in a mined area trying to lead their lives while surrounded with these deadly hidden things, the soldiers who mined the area, demining efforts etc. Maybe it would be interesting to center the narrative around a single field and zoom on different people connected to it.<br/><br/>How are you thinking of using Zombie Cinema for this, Jason?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252862/#Comment_252862" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T11:27:09+00:00" title="January 26, 2010 11:27AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My thoughts: You center the game on people with strong ties to a village in a conflict zone. They could be soldiers, civilians, peacekeepers, children, whatever. This is all guided by card draws that give you a set of three attributes, just like the original game.<br/><br/>Zombies are replaced with the broader conflict, specifically mining. Each "step forward" brings the dangers closer to home. Initially the conflict is intense fighting in the village itself - sort of a reversal of Zombie Cinema's creeping doom. After that, as the danger continues to escalate on the game board, it is all about emplaced mines and left-over ordinance creating threats to livestock, children, and so forth. The point is not to focus on the actual conflict but rather its residue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252935/#Comment_252935" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T15:04:51+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  3:04PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a supplement in the 80s for the game Top Secret SI which was called something like Brushfire Wars(?) It was "ripped from the headlines" scenarios for military operations and counter-terrorism. <br/><br/>The cool thing about the supplement is how now it really shows what people thought of as "military" action in the 80s. Most of the scenarios involved the taking of hostages (like on an airplane or in an airport) in a location or small unit infiltration of a foriegn country (usually a jungle). If that supplement were being written today, I imagine it would paint a much different image of military action and the kinds of scenarios we read about in the news. <br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252938/#Comment_252938" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T15:06:28+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  3:06PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "So I ask you:<b>What recent news events would you want to play a game about?</b>What would you like to explore?"<br/><br/>I'd want to do a game of Best Friends set at the Grammy Awards.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252982/#Comment_252982" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T19:02:53+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  7:02PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Zombies are replaced with the broader conflict, specifically mining.
