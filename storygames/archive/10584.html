The players describe their intended course of action.<br/>2. My random knowledge database, which is filled with all sorts of shit because I am an incorrigible information sponge, may kick out some data that is relevant to what the players said.<br/>3. I check to see if I can incorporate said data into the game <i>in a way that develops conflict</i>.<br/>4. If I can, then I quickly explain the data to the players, tell them whether or not their characters understand it, and find a way to factor it into resolution.<br/><br/>You know how, like, Stephen Hunter or Tom Clancy novels will give you asides about technical shit? And then the details mentioned in those asides become (later or immediately) relevant to the conflict, making them not just randomly amusing technical details, but an engrossing piece of the actual story? (Stephen Hunter's a lot better about doing this consistently than Tom Clancy, in my experience, but I don't think he's as widely read)<br/>It's like that. Me explaining the stuff to the players is like the aside you get from the narrator.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234760/#Comment_234760" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T16:29:30+00:00" title="September 29, 2009  4:29PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So as a player I don't have to know shit?

It's ok, bro. We've all been wrong before. (^.^)<br/><br/>Anyway, from the original thread, and Marshall's example, I do this a lot too.<br/><br/>I personally hate deep research in my RPGs. As GM, I don't want to feel that I have to read books I may or may not be interested just to get into a character and the like. BUT, I *do* expose myself to media: Wikipedia knowledge-blurbs, youtube vids on the subject, and so on. This results in... well, I wouldn't call it "developing conflict", but it factors into both narration (description) and resolution factors (rules bonuses for "a good/plausible idea" etc).<br/><br/>The place where this happens the most is when I run or play in a cyberpunk-style game (We've been doing Shadowrun on and off for a few years now in one of my weekend groups). About 3 people in the group work with computers in real life: I manage large enterprise computer storage systems, so know all sorts of things about storage hardware, encryption/security, networking, protocols, hacks and the like. My friend Alan doesn't know jack about hardware, but he is a programmer by trade, usually application focused or theoretical (he is employed by the W3C). Beth is a C+ programmer, and also has a master's degree in Psychology.  When we get to a scene involving hacking, *we go fucking nuts with description*. We add in little pieces of information (and don't get into arguments; it's just a game), little embelishments from our real world brought over into a futuristic setting that really *places* what we're trying to do in character, and gets some of that capital I-Immersion with the other players. When Alan describes some fictional hacking protocol, then Beth jumps in for a sec dropping little snippets about coding, then I drop some scene describing how some network security thingy was overwritten... well, it looks like those "jazz ensemble" metaphors Ron E drops in the Sorcerer book.<br/><br/>(cont)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_234790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234790/#Comment_234790" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T20:40:30+00:00" title="September 29, 2009  8:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            However, note that this is us bringing in stuff from our real work lives into the game.<br/><br/>To a degree, I try to do this about things that I don't know about in real life as well, but I strike a balance. Say for example, I want to play an Elizabethan Era character (which I will, next week, in our Castle Falkenstein game). I'm going to read a little Wikipedia about the era, for say 10-15 minutes total. I'll maybe look up a youtube clip on dress or manners from the era (I'm a visual learner: Picking up a book and digging in just doesn't work for me). I am not looking for things to memorize, I'm looking for little baubles of information that I can use to spice up the narration in things my character does. Some might enhance complications/conflicts ("my maid tied the knots in my bodice; I want to have a tryst; can I relace without her knowing?" etc), but a lot of it will just become fodder for bringing into scenes, or aiding in giving flavor to what is happening in the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_234791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/234791/#Comment_234791" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-29T20:43:24+00:00" title="September 29, 2009  8:43PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interestingly enough, this is one of the reasons why I think La Comme Il Faut is one of the best sourcebooks for ANY RPG, ever.

This sort of accuracy does not define RtD, and it does not mean that RtD is occurring -- <i>just as</i> the sort of narrative authority you get in Uni does not define Story Now, and does not mean that Story Now is occurring (you get that same sort of full-tilt director stance content authority in <i>Super Action Now!</i>).<br/><br/>Furthermore, "doesn't actually contribute to the game" has many different forms. It depends on the game. With any game, you have to look at it and pinpoint, <i>what exactly is fun about this game?</i> It's a big, usually complicated answer -- it's never just one thing, and you can never just point out a Creative Agenda and leave it at that. You gotta get specific. Anything that supports that something, that's what can "actually contribute to the game."<br/><br/>So, sometimes I'll ignore accuracy in RtD play because it fucks over the thing we're emulating/appreciating. Sometimes I'll use it because it gets us deeper into it, lets us appreciate it more.<br/>Sometimes I'll ignore accuracy in Story Now play because it jumps conflict or is completely irrelevant to the conflict. Sometimes I'll use it because it develops and/or complicates a conflict. (This "conflict" in the lit-crit sense, not in the sense of "conflict resolution")<br/>Sometimes I'll ignore accuracy in Step on Up play because it obviates tactics, or makes gameable rules into nonsense. Sometimes I'll use it because it can be gamed itself -- as long as you have a language for it in your System, it's always fun to say, "This and this and this are true; do you have what it takes to take advantage of this rather than let it shut you down?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235025/#Comment_235025" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T10:51:15+00:00" title="October  1, 2009 10:51AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (NEVER use Big Model terms, David, dammit!)<br/><br/>OK, I think I follow you, in that all the detail augments you sense of verisimilitude... but only when it augments; it's disregarded if it becomes niggling or tedious.<br/><br/>Makes sense. Not sure that such a balance requires a particularly detailed understanding of 17th C sailing or differences between rifled barrels and smoothbore or how to fold a calling card during about a 50-year period in history. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> After all, if everyone at the table is ignorant, you can fake it and no one's the wiser (except you, as faker--and so what?); meanwhile, if someone DOES have detailed info about FOO... then why not given them the authority to narrate such details? It's a fun (though sometimes disarming) technique to just toss the Talking Stick to your table's authority on [whatever] and let him or her fill in the blanks of details about mizzenmasts and hawsers.<br/><br/>I guess I'm sort of missing out on the need for rigor. Personal predilection, I'm thinking: it's part of your "lonely fun" in game prep. Obviously, it's not a part of everyone's (and some folks find its utility downright unbelievable; viz this thread's origin).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235082/#Comment_235082" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-01T13:06:57+00:00" title="October  1, 2009  1:06PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It feeds on itself.

Have you tried any other approaches?<br/><br/>Mind you, I'm asking for entirely selfish reasons. I like historical setting games, and have been wanting to do even just a one-shot or two set in WW2 France for ages. I wouldn't be as concerned with technical stuff, but there's a ton to know about political and cultural environment that I'm going to be assuming players are unlikely to know, and that stuff could make a huge difference in how the game plays out.<br/><br/>Right now, the only particularly clever idea I've had (IMO) for this is "idea sheets". Basically, I write down in short form all kinds of stuff I think might be relevent to understanding on 3 x 5 index cards. Then, I take the cards and whatever images I can find online and create sheets with that info more or less randomly distributed on them and hand them around to the players. These sheets would be almost like collages, with 6-8 squares of info per side. There could be more sheets than players.<br/><br/>The players can freely hand these sheets around. The info is actually supposed to be a bit disjointed and random to encourage cross-table comparison and conversation.<br/><br/>Mind you, this is all hypothetical. I have no idea how it might work in practice. The closest I've seen to this was a mystery game I played as a kid in school.<br/><br/>One other thing I've seen that might have an application is the "canon keeper" concept from Archipelago. In that game, each player has an area of the setting/game universe  that they have  say over. It isn't generally a literal geographic area, but more of a concept area, like religion, technology, magic, whatever. For that specific area, the player can veto or ask for better info or whatever, with some final say in it when it comes up in play. The overall affect on play is to split up responsibilty for keeping a consistent vision among all the players, rather than just one person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235369/#Comment_235369" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-03T09:23:51+00:00" title="October  3, 2009  9:23AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, I've never tried spreading it around. But then again, it's not like I'm explicitly the loremaster or anything; just by default. If any of the players got it into their heads to go research shit, I'd be all for it.<br/><br/>As for explaining the stuff...<br/>What I did was, read a lot of William S. Burroughs, and then get recordings of him reading his stuff, and learned to mimic his cadence of speech (although I do it faster) and style of explanation. When he explains things, it's never boring.<br/>You could probably do Hunter S. Thompson instead, if you don't have the stomach for WSB. And probably a bunch of other people too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
