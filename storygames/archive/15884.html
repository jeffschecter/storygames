I think my pitch is quite different, though.  And I've posted this on a few other forums st this point...<br/>\n<br/>\nSo this is the idea I'm pitching for a V20 chronicle, which I think could be awesome if I can pull it off. I'm looking for feedback and suggestions. I'm looking at it taking place in two different time periods: the 1989s, where the characters' Embraces will happen, and the 2060s, where the world is a vastly different place. I see the future segments as having the traditional Vampire feel, but with a flavoring of Blade-Runner-esque cyberpunk. I've posted my basic IC pitch below...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThe year is 2062, and the world has changed. Things have advanced quite a bit since I was a young man. Then again, it's been a long time since I was a "man" at all...<br/>\nThe future is here, and although it's not all like science fiction predicted (no flying cars, f'rex), things are still pretty sweet. Supercomputers can be, and are, held in one hand. Long-distance communication is more visual now, using holograms and the like. And my personal favorite: paper money is dead, all currency is digital and universal now.<br/>\nWhen you have over 150 years of accumulation, being able to have it all in one form of currency and easily keep track of it is a godsend. Not that I've had anything to do with God since...<br/>\nBut I digress. The largest source of energy is now solar power -- which, fortunately, does not contain the same properties as actual sunlight. Thankful for small favors, believe you me.<br/>\nThe biggest change of all, though, is one that much of the world isn't even aware of. We are, because it affects us. But the Kine? They have no idea, none whatsoever, that the centuries-old conflict ( I hesitate to call it a war, it was hardly ever that overt) between the Camarilla and the Sabbat has apparently drawn to close.<br/>\nOh, don't get me wrong, it isn't like we're all best buddies all of a sudden. But we're also not all trying to give each other the Final Death every chance we get. Well, most of us aren't, anyways. There are always dissidents, pockets of resistance, ya know? But on the whole, things are a lot calmer now that we have a truce (albeit an uneasy one).<br/>\nLike I said, it's a whole new world.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360834/#Comment_360834" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T12:30:41+00:00" title="February 20, 2012 12:30PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Why not shift the dates slightly?<br/><br/>From 1989 to 1985..and from 2062 to 2061.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>Because then you can link to a cyclical astronomical event, the passing of Halley's Comet.<br/><br/>This could have some kind of esoteric significance to elders, or it might even be linked to some kind of dark ritual.<br/><br/>Just an idea.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_360845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Surfmonkey01" title="Surfmonkey01"><img alt="Surfmonkey01" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Surfmonkey01">Surfmonkey01</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360845/#Comment_360845" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T12:51:04+00:00" title="February 20, 2012 12:51PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vulpinoid, that's awesome.

This can range from character (PC and NPC) immortality because they have to survive the next 75 years, to decisions ("No, you can't burn down the historic library because that's my base in the future!"), and everything in between.<br/><br/>That could be fun, but it's asking for a disaster with a system like Storyteller (with no benefits to compensate).<br/><br/>I played in a game that sounds similar to this in some ways. We started in 1999, but all the PCs were elders by that point (with origins ranging from the Roman era Greece to 18th century England) and we moved ahead at a fast clip, skipping years.  We also did flash backs into the long histories of these characters. One particular flashback, resulted in exactly one of these retcons.  It turned out, one of the two anti-tribue Sabbat characters was a Sabbat member since the 15th century.  The revelation of this information resulted in the PC needing to be taken out because this game was not about humanizing the Sabbat.  Aside from flashbacks, time moved forward, so things like that were rare occurrences. It also fit the vibe we were going for. Huge, massive, mysteries that get revealed suddenly, and changes the course of events in surprising ways.<br/><br/>If you are switching between the 80s and the 60s, that will be happening a lot.  In some cases that could be cool, like characters who exist only in the past - what happened to them, are they going to die?  But it sounds like walking through a minefield. You should expect many, many out of character conversations about the repercussions of players establishing this fact or that fact.<br/><br/>A system that grants more narrative mechanics (esp. rewards) to the players for managing this stuff seems like a better fit if your goal is to have this narrative framework.<br/><br/>It sounds to me that the most interesting part is the future era (from your IC pitch).  If that's so, I'd focus on that and flash back to the 80s only on occasion, and with very specific set ups (e.g. "This is the time where Leonard killed a Sabbat Bishop and watched his wife die.")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_360915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Surfmonkey01" title="Surfmonkey01"><img alt="Surfmonkey01" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Surfmonkey01">Surfmonkey01</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/360915/#Comment_360915" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-20T17:05:48+00:00" title="February 20, 2012  5:05PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As the idea has evolved, I've adjusted the percentages to roughly 80/20, favoring the future.

They were interesting, but they were very Cyberpunk focused. That might be great for your Bladerunner-esque future. I thought it was cool, but circa mid 90's cyberpunk cool is almost certainly a much different metric than I'd apply now.<br/><br/>I got two of the issues. If I recall, the third issue focused mostly on rules stuff. I had gotten them because I ran a cyberpunk Werewolf game. I didn't really need rules for Vampires, so for whatever reason I didn't bother tracking down the third issue.  It might be helpful. Again, it's very much inspired by Cyberpunk of the era, particularly Cyberpunk 2020.

You'll likely only reveal your secret by whispering it in someone's ear, and only if you're killing them (NB: that's a rule).  Otherwise, you'll become scandalized and vulnerable \u2013 oh, shock and horror!<br/>\u2022 Your Edges are what keeps your character alive in this harsh world. They signify four general types of cachet: Physical/Combat, Hacking, Investigation and Social Influence. They are left fairly general so that you can interpret specifically what they mean in a given situation. You may deploy Edges to try to gain the upper hand (i.e. a total victory) in a conflict by convincing the party you're trying to defeat of your Edge's decisive power. Each Edge may be deployed up to three times in a game of BloodNet, but these deployments can be exhausted (through conflict) and regenerated (through medical care, purchases and such) over the course of the larp.<br/>\u2022 Your Ends are what your character's general goals are in the short-term, medium-term and long-term. You may deploy Ends to try to gain the upper hand in a conflict by convincing the other party that winning this conflict would directly help you achieve it. When you deploy an End, it is exhausted for the entire game.<br/>\u2022 Your Angst is what you're generally brooding about. There are no happy people in BloodNet.<br/>\u2022 Your Vulnerability is your character\u2019s weak spot; something that will cause you to take the Fall or an Owe pretty much no matter what. Other characters can investigate you and discover this.<br/>\u2022 Your Questions Unanswered are aspects of your character even you don't know about. Don't know the answer until it comes up in play. Other players can play Fall cards to answer them for you, or answer them in the debriefing at the end of the game.<br/>\u2022 Your Connections are the direct relationships your character has with other players and organizations in Manhattan 2094. If you ever feel stuck or isolated, hit up one of your friends, enemies or frenemies for something. Adventure awaits you in your social network.<br/>\u2022 Your What You Know about the Vampires paragraph is exactly how much knowledge your character possesses about the vampires now plaguing Manhattan 2094. This is important in that not all the characters have the same level of knowledge.<br/>\u2022 Your Q&amp;A should look familiar to you. These are the questions you answered for us earlier. This is the closest thing your character has to a written "back-story" (the rest you make up as you go along!) so read it over as a refresher.<br/>\u2022 Your Additional Information is anything that you deserve to know about, usually based on something the GMs or the other PCs have decided about your character. These aspects are all true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365853/#Comment_365853" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T03:29:08+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  3:29AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And all you need to know about the game rules:<br/><br/>BloodNet follows three principles, namely<br/>1. The game is only as good as the description we as the GMs and PCs supply about any given plot point.<br/>2. Invest yourself in your character not only as a unique (selfish) individual, but also as a component of a larger story.<br/>3. Your play should enhance how awesome all the other characters are, and their play yours.<br/><br/>This means in practice that, if you're going to do something, you should show us with your body or narrate with your lips how you're doing it, what the air smells like as you're doing it, etc. Make it real for the other players without crossing any boundaries. That being said, BloodNet contains some meta-game components (Fall cards, Owe lists, Questions Unanswered) that force you to think outside of your character. These are not so much intent on breaking your immersion in your character as they are insurance that, whatever your character does, it WILL be interesting and arouse the interest of the other players. These other players are in turn your lifeline for the evening, even if you're all backstabbing, lying to and killing each other. The solutions you arrive at by talking it out are far preferable than the ones the GM's can conjure up for you, and you will have a far better game experience should you choose to support your fellow players' opportunities to role-play and act rather than scheme and look for loopholes in the rules to get your way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365854/#Comment_365854" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T03:29:47+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  3:29AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 3:30AM by Evan_Torner.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * About the World:<br/><br/>Manhattan 2094 - The BloodNet world is an information tyranny ruled by megacorporation TransTechnicals. TransTechnicals designed, programmed and now controls the areas of cyberspace you traverse. New York meanwhile teems with people who illicitly surf the edge in the quest for information freedom: the underground. BloodNet is about the ongoing war for access between TransTech and the Underground. But it\u2019s also about vampires: apparently, they\u2019re now running amok on the streets and add an additional dimension of horror to everyone\u2019s everyday lives.<br/><br/>In practical terms, your characters are the "cool" kids of an otherwise bleak and oppressive future. While not wealthy, you have managed to strike out an existence in the margins of society that has led you to social cred, technological savvy and maybe even a little money. Business is generally done with credits: 1,000 is about a good week's pay, 10,000 is a large sum, 100,000 is a fortune, though it probably comes at a steep price.  Most of your characters (except for Melissa van Helsing) start off with a good 800 credits in the bank account, and are likely looking for the next job. The 'Net is a virtual consciousness space and can be accessed only through TransTechnicals (an unlikely possibility) or the hacker bar Caf\xe9 Voltaire. It contains a vast wealth of information, but is monitored and patrolled by TransTech's hacker minions and programs. Jacking into cyberspace involves lying down in Caf\xe9 Voltaire and plugging yourself through your cyberdeck (it's rumored that a wireless cyberdeck exists somewhere in town). No one has cell phones (sorry!) \u2013 stationary video phones are the order of the day. Guns come in a variety of forms: lasers, EMP focalizers, and regular kinetic handguns and shotguns are ubiquitous among street folk, making even casual altercations often deadly.  You wear armor when you leave the house, and hire toughs to stand over you while you're jacked in the 'Net. Drugs are also rampant among the populace: everyone knows an addict, and many of you may be rehabilitating yourselves slowly.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, as of a week ago, suddenly vampires (and the supernatural) have come out of hiding and begun to feed on the populace. That's probably the first thing on your character's mind right about now.<br/><br/>The topography of Manhattan 2094 will be crudely laid out on the floor of the playspace with a combination of A) masking tape, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> folders and C) furniture to delineate locations. Space is not equivocal and has an effect on your character's experience of the world.  When you as a PC wander into a space for the first time, pick up the folder there and read the location description. Then follow any additional instructions the location may have.  There may be clues or dramatic prompts available for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365855/#Comment_365855" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T03:30:40+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  3:30AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            * About Doing Things in the World:<br/><br/>Your characters are competent. Most of the time when you want to do something, you can do it.<br/>If you describe your action to a nearby GM and it is A) well-described, <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> cool and cyberpunk, C) fitting for your character, and D) non-disruptive to another character or the game's major fictions or functions, you can likely accomplish it.<br/><br/>Example:  The PC playing Ransom wants to pick the lock at the LUNA facility. He leans over and makes a lock-picking-like gesture.  Then he motions for a GM to come over. PC: "I'm breaking into the LUNA facility."  GM: "How are you doing that?"  PC: "Well, I won this electronic multitool in a card game that turns out to have a keypad-recall function. Now I've got it hooked into this keypad and am pulling up the recent memory of all the numbers entered. The code's the repeated number." GM: "OK. You tap your way through it and get into the door."  PC: "What do I see?"  GM: ...<br/><br/>If you have an investigation-type skill, you may also approach a GM and pursue some kind of query, like "What's Tempered Steele's Vulnerability?" or "How do I get access to the Doom Pilots' secret device?" The GM will then ask for a description of how they're going about to find that information. If the information has to do with major plot points or other players' Vulnerabilities and Secrets, you may be sent on a little quest.<br/><br/>If you have a hacking skill, you can enter the 'Net at Caf\xe9 Voltaire, at TransTech, or with a mythical wireless cyberdeck. In any case, once logged in, it\u2019s presumed you\u2019ve got your body in Caf\xe9 Voltaire or wherever while your mind is in the \u2018Net.  Then you can spend some of their hacking skill to delve in and find information while braving some dangers. You may be asked to write a rudimentary 'program', or go on a quest for the information, particularly if it involves another character or a major plot point.<br/><br/>* Conflict<br/><br/>The easiest way to solve all conflict is to talk it out amongst yourselves.  Decide through narration who wins, the loser gets a Fall card, and the winner describes how they win (with some minor concession to the loser) and writes the character's name on their personal Owe list for the end of the game.<br/><br/>Example: Melissa van Helsing wants to seduce Ransom Stark a second time. Melissa [moving into position to do so]: "I place my hand on yours and lick my lips. You're going to want to come away with me." Ransom: "Not so fast. I remember what you did to me last time. Ransom backs away." Melissa: "I'm concerned about you, Ransom. I want to keep you safe. If I promise to keep you safe, will you give me what... I want?" Ransom: "Oh, fine. I give in. [takes Fall card; Melissa writes Ransom's name on her nametag]" Melissa: "We go back to my apartment, and this time I turn off all the cameras they might be using to keep an eye on us..."<br/><br/>Sometimes it's not so simple.  If your conflict is physical, and if its stakes are life and death, naturally you may want a more formal system of resolution.  In that case, summon a GM, and he/she'll walk you through the following steps.<br/><br/>1. If two or more PCs are in conflict, the different sides must make themselves clear: all conflict will boil down to one individual/group pitted against another individual/group ... meaning a 3rd party must either temporarily pick a side (they can always flee) or stay on the sidelines until a new conflict can be initiated. Each side selects a leader, and they are the one who announces the actions for the group. These leaders may shift over time as different people seize the initiative.<br/><br/>2. Once the sides are clear, everyone assumes their awesome fighting pose. The Attacker begins by vividly describing their environment and their opening move.  Leaders of groups can incorporate their groups\u2019 strengths into the fight, but they are the ones speaking. The Defender then counters with a partial success: the Attackers\u2019 attack partially succeeds, but partially fails. This could be a \u201cYes, but\u201d or \u201cNo, but\u201d statement in or against the Attackers\u2019 favor.  Then the Defender gets a counter-attack, which can also be responded with a partial success.  In groups greater than two, the leader of either can choose to disperse the negative consequences throughout the group.<br/><br/>3. If either side deploys an Edge or an End, then they can make a bid for a full victory.  An Edge can be used once per hour for every hour of the game, and usage in a conflict \u201cexhausts\u201d the Edge for that hour (it can, however, be recovered in the hospital, etc.) An End can be used to make a bid only once for the entire length of the game \u2013 use it wisely.  If you use an Edge on an opponent, the opponent now has several options:<br/><br/>-Lose (\u201ctake the Fall\u201d). The opponent get a \u201cFall\u201d card, which is like a free Edge or End deployment in the future, and the victor writes down the loser\u2019s name on their Owe list. That means\u2013come game end\u2013the victor will have to exalt the loser\u2019s reputation in 2-3 sentences of praise. In the meantime, the victor can give the loser a choice of two bad options (including "damage" like the loss of up to 3 Edge uses), and they have to pick one of the two and describe how it happens.<br/><br/>-Counter. They use an Edge or an End, describe how that counters the Edge/End, and mark it off on their sheet. They could also use a Fall card in response. Now they may choose to exhaust one of their own Edges to try and force a full victory on the winner, or make their escape.  This could result in another stalemate, however. Note that only the leader can use their Edges to do this. Others can step up to become the leader who haven't exhausted their Edges.<br/><br/>-Pass off the damage to a party member. Yep, you can wound a party member for 3 Edge slots and keep going.<br/><br/>-Kill. Either party at this point can choose to deploy 2 Edges/Ends or Fall cards AND whisper either your vulnerability or your secret in the ear of the one to be killed. They describe their own death.  If they play 3 Fall cards, however, they can kill you too \u2013 immediately and in a manner of their choosing.<br/><br/>4. If it stalemates, a GM comes in and sees which party is more vulnerable in the situation.  Then they choose the victor based on what they feel like.<br/><br/>5. If a player dies as a result of a fight, they\u2019ve got three options:<br/>-Their body's dead, but their soul becomes a program in the Net. This allows a player to still circulate and provide information after they\u2019re dead.\u2028<br/>-They're not quite dead, and a cyber-doc can bring them back at a heavy cost (i.e. some Edges/Ends capacities)\u2028<br/>-They\u2019re dead dead. Go to a GM and get an NPC for a faction of your choice. This PC cannot get Fall cards, but functions otherwise like any PC.<br/><br/>* Fall Cards and Owe List<br/>As stated above, Fall cards are basically future rewards your character gets for losing the present conflict.  With Fall cards, you can do any of the following activities:<br/>- Expend 1 (i.e., give 1 to the nearby GM) to answer a Question Unanswered on a character's name card<br/>- Expend 1 to push for a full victory in a conflict<br/>- Expend 1 (if you're a vampire) to bite someone<br/>- Expend 2 and whisper your character's secret in your opponent's ear to kill them.<br/>- Expend 3 to kill a character who is killing you<br/>- Expend X to overcome/bypass a task, where X is an amount between 1 and 3 named by a nearby GM<br/>Note: Players can only have up to 3 Fall cards at a time.<br/><br/>The Owe List is a special meta-game mechanic that spills over to the debriefing after the game.  You write down the names of people who take Fall cards in conflicts with you. At the end, when prompted, you will be invited to tell a street legend (in-character or out-of-character) about their character.  Any Questions Unanswered should be answered here and now. The idea is that even if you lose a lot of conflicts in the game, you are nevertheless certainly the badass everyone knows you are when all is said and done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365890/#Comment_365890" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T06:35:50+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  6:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very cool!  Thanks for sharing!<br/><br/>I have limited (read: no) experience with LARPing, so it's interesting to me to see how mechanics interact with play.  I guess it's not too terribly different from what we do around the table, except one's entire body gets in on the act.<br/><br/>The setting is also cool.  Can't beat cyberpunk in my book and vampires are just a plus.  I like that cell phones are not a thing, since they had not broken out into everyone's pocket back in the heyday of c-punk, and so we were still attached to the idea of the pay phone.  It's a little thing, but it builds the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
