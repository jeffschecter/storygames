I would suggest:<br/><br/>- Keep GM turns short.<br/><br/>- Aim to get 2 GM and 2 Player turns in 4 hours.<br/><br/>- Don't worry about explaining Traits and earning checks in detail till you start playing. Often players don't get why checks are important till they've suffered conditions and played 1 GM and 1 Player turn.<br/><br/>- People love the map. Put it in the middle of the table and show it off. If you have the comics, it can be fun to leave them on the table open to a particularly cool scene.<br/><br/>- I like to tempt people to use their Traits against themselves. I see you want to work with this mouse who may say is untrustworthy and you have the Skeptical Trait, you know if you roleplay that out and subtract a single die, you get to earn checks!<br/><br/>- Remember, helping each other is great, but if someone fails a roll and gain a Condition, the people who helped also gain a lesser Condition.<br/><br/>- I like to deal out Conditions in the first GM turn (makes the GM turn shorter, gives players Conditions to work off in the Player Turn) and Twists in the second GM turn.<br/><br/>- The conflict cards are great! Definitely use them. If players seem confused by the Conflict system, tell them it is like Rock Paper Scissors. At the start using Attack and Maneuver is pretty safe. Defend is great if you are hurt. Feint is the most risky maneuver (great when used successfully, disastrous if not). If they are nervous, tell them to hold on using Feint till they understand the game more. <br/><br/>- Remember, you roll your Skill and can help yourself with 1 Wise, 1 Gear, and 1 Trait. You can't use your other Skills to help yourself and you can't use multiple Wises, Gear, or Traits. Each other player can only give you 1 Helping die each. <br/><br/>- Helping can get out of hand if we get lazy with roleplaying. Helping doesn't equal free dice for no work. My general rule is if it takes you more than 10 seconds to think of how you can Help, you probably can't Help. And all Help must be roleplayed. Also don't forget, Help has consequences so sometimes not helping is ok. <br/><br/>That all said, it's a great game. Let yourself make mistakes. Have fun!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353847">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353847/#Comment_353847" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T22:16:23+00:00" title="January 10, 2012 10:16PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2012 11:26PM by johnzo.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and one thing to add: if I were running a one-shot, I think I'd de-emphasize Conflict.

In the rest of the game, you're hustling for opportunities to earn checks and to generate helper dice and figuring out how to push your mouse's personal agenda, but in Conflict, you're making tactical guesses that can have sudden, unforgiving and definitive outcomes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353848/#Comment_353848" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T22:29:09+00:00" title="January 10, 2012 10:29PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you hit them too hard with Conditions, the players drain their whole turn healing, not initiating stuff they find interesting.

Usually 1 GM turn is all it takes. <br/><br/>Ultimately it depends on the players, their tastes, and experience. My friends who love the The Fury of Dracula boardgame were used to Rock Paper Scissor mechanics and they were comfortable starting with a conflict right away. <br/><br/>I would reserve conflicts for situations where:<br/><br/>1. Multiple players are involved.<br/>2. Both sides want something different. <br/><br/>To elaborate on "want something different". "I kill you" vs. "no you don't" can work but it's more fun to have "I kill you" vs. "I show everyone watching how weak you are."\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Robbins</cite>If you hit them too hard with Conditions, the players drain their whole turn healing, not initiating stuff they find interesting. That can take away a lot of the fun of the game..</blockquote>\n+1<br/><br/>Great point!<br/><br/>You can probably load players up with the Hungry, Angry, and Tired conditions without too much trouble. They only give you a penalty in conflicts and they don't stack. So if 2 people are Angry in a conflict, only 1 Angry counts. Also if you have access to family, they can heal your Hungry and Tired conditions for free (no checks needed).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353890/#Comment_353890" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T08:14:50+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  8:14AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Felan</cite>Thanks everyone!

But could you elaborate?

You can also mine the suggested "Player Turn" section for ideas. And use failed rolls to create Twists that you need to deal with in the second GM Turn. Also follow closely what the players do on their turn. Player Turns are great for inspiring future GM Turns.<br/><br/>Some players have difficulty with the Player Turn. They are used to the GM driving the plot or just don't have any ideas. It can be helpful to inspire them with examples. On the Player Turn you can:<br/><br/>- Use Resources to buy things.<br/>- Use Circles to make friends or find mice.<br/>- Use Skills to build things.<br/>- Practice your Skills.<br/>- Go after your Enemies! <br/>- Your family can heal your Hungry or Tired conditions for free.<br/>- Your Friends and Senior Artisans can provide help and tools.<br/>- Your Mentor will only help in times of great danger.<br/>- Recover from conditions.<br/><br/>Also remember, after the Player Turn, you have a chance to earn Fate and Persona points. <br/><br/>Look at your Belief, Goal, and Instinct. Did you play them yet? If not, how can you use your Player Turn to play these so you can earn Fate and Persona points after the Player Turn is done.<br/><br/>Also, give everyone a chance to rewrite their Belief and Instinct at the start of the game and after the first Player Turn.<br/><br/>For new Goals, it helps to play out a very quick scene where you lay down the mission for the GM Turn, then create Goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353892/#Comment_353892" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T08:27:31+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  8:27AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Felan</cite>Any tips on when exactly to pause and begin the Players' turn?

Time is running out... will you sacrifice your own interests to rush back to Lockhaven to save it from war or will you follow your heart and risk leaving Lockhaven to its fate? I suggest not doing this until you've played the game for a while.<br/><br/>I would also play with time loosely in the Player Turn. Jump back and forward as is appropriate. <br/><br/>Some players have a hard time understanding checks. Sometimes I will refer to them as "scenes" or "spotlight".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353894/#Comment_353894" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-11T08:43:22+00:00" title="January 11, 2012  8:43AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just played a little Mouse Guard for the first time and I was flabbergasted about what I couldn't do as a player during the GM's turn.

Let me explain.<br/><br/>What failed tests actually are, more often than not, is a confrontation with reality where nothing ever is perfect. A successful test in Mouseguard generally means things go according to the plan and no external influences manifest to get in your way. If you think about it, is that common in real life? Not really. One of the eyeballing rules when estimating software project deadlines is: estimate the time reallistically, then multiply it by two because there will be unforeseen interference. In other words: SNAFU.<br/><br/>Now, a rose by any other name does not smell as sweet. If you hear that your hero "fails" constantly, this doesn't feel very heroic. Conversely, when your hero "encounters opposition", that sounds better, doesn't it? Battling opposition is what heroes do all the time.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what a better terminology would be for failure, just throwing this out there <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/halski" title="halski"><img alt="halski" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/halski">halski</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354047/#Comment_354047" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T07:33:22+00:00" title="January 12, 2012  7:33AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jane, thanks for throwing it out!

For me, really lengthy explanatory texts like Mouse Guard and Apocalypse World can be fun to read, but I wish they were more accessible, because they can be really intimidating to approach and contain so many nuggets of brilliance and important things to remember that I wish there were better short summaries that succinctly presented the most important bits, because it can be hard to digest all at once.  Apocalypse World does that nice thing by having memorably named principles and moves that are easy to reference and the new Mouse Guard GM sheets/screen are hugely helpful, but I feel like it would be useful to have short chapter summaries or some place where all the necessary bits were listed in a few pages.  That would make it easier for folks like me to understand the big picture rather than trying to absorb it piece by piece, after heavy investment.  Sometimes, you don't even know whether a game is "your thing" or not until you've invested many hours in attempting to understand it, and it would be nice to be able to jump right in and have some sense of what it's about and how it does those things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354134/#Comment_354134" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T01:27:02+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  1:27AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's a great point, Jonathan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354143/#Comment_354143" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T06:52:52+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  6:52AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this an issue that could be solved with some high quality, double-sided, player aids?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354153/#Comment_354153" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-13T08:23:55+00:00" title="January 13, 2012  8:23AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's sort of what the character sheets are.

I played Mouse Guard tonight at last. We had a really good time, bumps and all. A big part of that is the people I play with - my group kicks ass, even when confronted with an unfamiliar system.<br/><br/>Spent the first hour or so running through the character sheet and the rules bit by bit (except for the conflict rules). It seems daunting at first but once you've they had it all laid out I think it was beginning to make sense. I talked them through Gwendolyn assigning the mission and the first two cities on the mail route pretty quickly, and then threw in the Pathfinder test. The impetuous tenderpaw took the lead to impress his mentor and (naturally) failed - they're forced to shelter in a hollowed-out stump, and a raven swoops in to steal the mailbag! (I tried to avoid having a conflict in the first GM turn, but I couldn't really see a way around it). The rest of the session was spent fighting the raven, and I can see how much fun the conflict system can be (I would love to play a large scale military conflict). The patrol divided into two teams of two, one with the goal of distracting and scaring off the Raven, and one with the goal of retrieving the mailbag. Team Mailbag took a medium compromise, retrieving half of the mail and sitting out the rest of the conflict while Team Distraction took the raven down to zero disposition and retrieved the rest of the mail - they also ended up with a medium compromise, and so I said they ended up angry (the tenderfoot was trying but failing to impress, the mentor was disappointed). We were running out of time, so rather than pressing on to the next down, I decided to give them a player turn in the hollowed out log, so they spent their checks trying (and failing) to get less angry, trying (and failing) to fashion a new, more durable mailbag, trying (and succeeding!) at carving a wooden flute, and accurately predicting the weather. Then we did the rewards (a bit pointless for a one-shot, but I wanted to see how it went) and called it a night.<br/><br/>I would love, love, love to play a longer campaign after this experience, and I think the players were intrigued too - maybe somewhere down the line, or just as an occasional thing. One thing that I noticed (and sort of discerned from the rules) is that it really demands and encourages a LOT of flavour and colour on the part of the GM and players, otherwise it just becomes a series of tests. This isn't a bad thing really, but you need to keep in mind that unlike other games, where you present some flavour and then the players react, as a GM you really need to narrate extended sequences in between tests, presumably with help from the players (for example, describing the uneventful journey delivering mail to the first two towns). But it's not going to be, "Okay, you're in Sprucetuck, WHAT DO YOU DO?" in the D&amp;D sense, it's more, "Okay, as you're distributing the mail in Sprucetuck, do you say hello to anyone in passing?" or something along those lines (because, after all, they're mice on a mission with no time to spare). The map and the mouse tokens from the boxed set, as well as the artwork on all the game materials, help with this a lot.<br/><br/>I have a few questions about rules we didn't quite grok that I'll be looking up, but I'll post 'em here too in case any other first-time players are interested:<br/><br/>- Do helpers mark down a pass or fail? If I help a Pathfinder test with my Scout skill and it succeeds, to I mark a pass for Scout?<br/>- Can you help with the same skill? Can I help a Pathfinder test with my Pathfinder skill, or does it have to be something different?<br/>- Can you use Instructor to help the person you're instructing do something? If my tenderfoot is fighting a raven, can I use Instruct to help by calling out advice?<br/>- When a team's disposition is reduced to zero but the other team keeps on fighting, can they give helper dice to the other team? And if they can, do they do so as a team or individually?<br/>- I think I may have screwed up the outcome for Team Distraction. Team Mailbag partially achieved their goal of retrieving the mail - but once they're out of the fight, Team Distraction doesn't get a new goal, so when they win the fight their compromise should only concern their original goal of "distract or scare away the raven." So, I don't think I should have let them take back the rest of the mail in their compromise, since that wasn't stated on their original goal. Or is that okay in this situation? It just seems weird that once one team is out of the fight, the other team's goal might be rendered moot.<br/>- We were a bit confused by the "Charge a trait" thing. First, can you charge a trait from 1 to 2 if it's been exhausted? Second, how long does the "charge" last? It says "until the end of the session," but that doesn't seem to make sense if the players' turn is often going to be at the end of the session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355079/#Comment_355079" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T05:34:57+00:00" title="January 20, 2012  5:34AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the write up!\n<blockquote>- Do helpers mark down a pass or fail?

But they do suffer a lesser Condition if the test is failed and Conditions are awarded. \n<blockquote>- Can you help with the same skill? Can I help a Pathfinder test with my Pathfinder skill, or does it have to be something different?</blockquote>\nIt may depend on the situation but generally yes. The skill chapter I believe (don't have the book in front of me) lists some example skills you can also help with. \n<blockquote>- Can you use Instructor to help the person you're instructing do something? If my tenderfoot is fighting a raven, can I use Instruct to help by calling out advice?</blockquote>\nI don't believe so, although that sounds like a cool scene. You could describe a regular Instructor skill test as the tenderpaw learning to fight an animal.\n<blockquote>- When a team's disposition is reduced to zero but the other team keeps on fighting, can they give helper dice to the other team? And if they can, do they do so as a team or individually?</blockquote>\nThat's a good question. It first would depend on the situation. In the story, is the other team in a position to help? My guess would be that they no longer count as a team (especially if the teams had separate goals and objectives) and the normal helping rules apply if the situation in the story makes sense. But I could be very wrong here. I would suggest asking on the Mouse Guard forums: <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?41-Mouse-Guard-RPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/forumdisplay.php?41-Mouse-Guard-RPG</a>\n<blockquote>- I think I may have screwed up the outcome for Team Distraction.

I would say in general, when you have 2 simultaneous teams, their goals should be distinct so that the success and failure of each team is independent. A lot is also going to depend on the story specifics. \n<blockquote>- We were a bit confused by the "Charge a trait" thing. First, can you charge a trait from 1 to 2 if it's been exhausted?

Mainly because there is a different check cost for re-using exhausted Traits. End of the session probably means end of the GM and Player Turn. But the book might say otherwise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355084/#Comment_355084" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T06:56:57+00:00" title="January 20, 2012  6:56AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Felan,<br/><br/>Looks like you had a great time!

Very helpful. I'll bring some of the more difficult ones over the MG forums.<br/><br/>Thor: I think you're right in saying that I shouldn't have allowed Team Distraction to retrieve any of the mail, but it makes the rest of the combat seem unnecessary - the patrol's overall goal is to retrieve the mail, so if that goal is no longer possible, why is the other team still fighting the raven? Shouldn't they just run away before risking any more losses (which isn't an option so far as I can see in Mouse Guard, once you're in a conflict, you're in for the duration)? I suppose their continued fight could be rationalized within the fiction as the raven continuing to harass the patrol, and the remaining team needing to scare it off before it does any more damage.<br/><br/>Noclue: I flubbed that one a bit too, but not as badly. The mouse who was weaving the new mailbag was already angry, so I gave him a choice, Dungeon World style: either he fails to complete the bag completely, or he stays up all night to finish the bag and ends up tired. The player chose complete failure, which meant that there was neither a twist nor a condition due to the failure. What I should have done is just <i>told</i> him that he stayed up all night to finish the bag, and imposed the Tired condition. (Alternatively, I could have used a weather twist and said he fails to make the bag because it starts to rain.)

The text probably could have been slightly clearer on this issue.<br/><br/>I'm assuming the Raven's goal was "Steal the mailbag!" One of the mice teams had a perfectly valid goal: "Distract and drive off the raven." The other team's goal was the somewhat problematic one because it was the direct inverse of the raven's goal: "Retrieve the mailbag."<br/><br/>When you engage with the conflict system, you are by default assumed to be in opposition to your opponent's goal. So the first team's goal could actually have been written as so: "Stop the raven from stealing the mailbag AND distract and drive off the raven."<br/><br/>In effect, the second team didn't have its own goal. It simply wanted to oppose the raven's goal. In such a case, I would encourage the second team to come up with its own goal--injure the raven, trap it, track it to its nest, etc. If they simply couldn't think of a second goal, I'd encourage them to form a single team with the first team instead.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I don't know how well we got this across in the text, but ravens are HUGE. Up to a five foot wing span and 4.5 lbs. And they prey on rodents in addition to their scavenging activities.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355124/#Comment_355124" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-20T11:45:33+00:00" title="January 20, 2012 11:45AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, that does make sense actually.

Maybe Gwendolyn starts giving the patrol cheesy milk-run missions because she doesn't want to tax the old guardmouse.  Anyone who is hungry for honor and glory will resent this.

I know it's the most complicated thing I've played since Pathfinder.<br/><br/>I was hoping to avoid conflict but somehow ended up with 3 - also did the mail run, and managed to nerf the raven conflict into just an obstacle - ("He's trying to get your mail bag, what do you do?") - but when I got to the guy convincing them to go past the scent border I was like, "Crap, this is an argument, I wanted to stay away from this," and one of my players was like, "Well, you gotta do it now, let's go." So we puzzled our way through. <br/><br/>Then in the player turn it actually got pretty awesome. I reminded them about the checks plenty, so they each had the free one and an earned one, and the tenderpaw went to convince his enemy NPC, recently promoted to guardmouse, to go get the carpenter's wedding present. So I turned it back on him "Okay, but he's trying to convince *you* that you should be the one who goes." - and they ended up knocking each other's disposition to 0 simultaneously. So they're both going together! Awesome!<br/><br/>(Is that the way Arguments really work, by the way? If you lose an Argument are you honor-bound to role-play it?)<br/><br/>So then the patrol leader had to convince them not to go, and yet a third argument ensued. The patrol leader had adage-wise, so he made up this adage for the extra die: "When you face a cat to save your family, you're labeled a hero. When you face a cat to get some cheese, you're labeled a fool." He won handily, and that ended the player turn, so they all got a beer together.<br/><br/><br/>Conflicts ... are weird. Seems like it's not much of an advantage to be on a team - you can add ~1/2 a point to your team's disposition? And a helper die each action? Is that it? <br/>Is the reason you team up simply because the rules require it?<br/><br/>We didn't use the advancement rules. (One of our players nearly got an aneurysm from the burning wheel advancement rules, so he didn't want to touch these.)  I gather that means you don't advance at all? Or is there another rules-lite way to advance? (Pick a skill at the end of the mission and advance it or something like that?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_363691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timonkey" title="timonkey"><img alt="timonkey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timonkey">timonkey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/363691/#Comment_363691" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-28T23:42:58+00:00" title="February 28, 2012 11:42PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can do arguments with versus tests, not just with the conflict system.<br/><br/>I don't think both of them going was the only compromise option, but you are bound to whatever compromise you negotiate.<br/><br/>Why did the patrol leader not just participate in the first argument?

Is it dirty pool for me to have a persuasive NPC initiate a persuade vs. test on a PC? I could use some stronger guidelines on 'when to use conflict' and 'when to use a vs test'</blockquote>\nI think you use conflict when:<br/>1) You want to engage more "game"<br/>2) It's really important to player(s)' BIGs<br/>3) You want to be able to compromise<br/><br/>(1) is really just about preference, and how much you like trying to outsmart the other guy, possibly to a better outcome than your numbers alone can afford<br/>(2) can go either way too.  You use it to make a scene longer and more important.  You can also do that by simply roleplaying more, but the mechanics enforce it a bit.<br/>(3) is the biggest difference in terms of the fiction I think.  If you have a versus test, then there are only two "failure" outcomes: success with a condition, and a twist.  You can get a lot more nuance and surprising results out of compromises in conflicts.<br/><br/>This is where I'm a little less clear.  If Martin is trying to convince you to go past the scent border to get his chair, is having him convince you a valid Twist?  It doesn't feel right, since that seems like straight-up failure (although not a stop-the-action failure).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

Gwendolyn suggest to this character that he retire.
