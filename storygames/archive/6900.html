First, remember all that flack about people not playtesting their games enough or releasing first editions that were not really playable as written?  I honestly think that has affected people's output.  There are a lot of cool games currently in development that are taking a longer development route than ones have in the past, which necessarily means there will be fewer hot new games out at any given moment.  Also, realize that, at least in the US, this is the calm before the GenCon storm.  Everybody's knuckling up to try to finish ashcans or final version of stuff before August.<br/><br/>Stuff I know is coming from folks (because I've seen them being playtested at JiffyCon and other places) includes:<br/><br/>- Julia Ellingboe's <i>The Fisherman's Wife</i> and <i>Murder Ballad Blackjack</i><br/>- Emily Care Boss's <i>Sign in Stranger</i> and <i>Under My Skin</i><br/>- Nathan Paoletta's <i>Annaliese</i><br/>- Shreyas Sampat's <i>Mist-Robed Gate</i><br/>- Elizabeth Shoemaker's <i>It's Complicated</i><br/>- Brennan Taylor's <i>How We Came to Live Here</i><br/>- Kevin Allen Jr.'s <i>Sweet Agatha</i><br/>- Judd Karlman's <i>1st Quest</i><br/>- Jeff Lower's <i>Giants</i><br/>- Anna Kreider's <i>Thou Art But a Warrior</i><br/>- and my game, <i>Geiger Counter</i><br/><br/>Almost all of these are currently (or have previously been or will soon be) available in ashcan form, which is a marked difference from development patterns of the past and a clear sign of the influence the Ashcan Front and other folks have had on the small press game development model.  Honestly, I'm really excited that people aren't rushing to get these games out and are taking the time to make sure they kick as much ass as possible.  I think that's a positive move for indie games overall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153666/#Comment_153666" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T08:36:08+00:00" title="June 29, 2008  8:36AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2008 8:36AM by ndp.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clint Krause's <i>Bizenghast Adventure Game</i> just came out, and <i>Empires of Dust</i> should be at Gen Con.<br/><br/>Gregor Huttons <i><a href="http://boxninja.livejournal.com/133949.html" rel="nofollow">3:16</a></i> just came out.<br/><br/><i><a href="http://imaginationsweatshop.com/" rel="nofollow">Trial &amp; Terror: Supernatural Investigation Unit</a></i> is a free PDF that was developed, designed, written and playtested in one week by the Imagination Sweatshop.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153667/#Comment_153667" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T08:58:40+00:00" title="June 29, 2008  8:58AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2008 8:59AM by Thunder_God.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, the amount of games, once the current slew complete their longer gestation, should remain unchanged:<br/>If you have games taking 20 months, or 2 months, after a while it should be the same amount of games released every month, if people begin working on the same number of games each month.<br/><br/>It is merely that until the first cycle is complete, there'll be more waiting.<br/><br/>Graham, what about Houses of the Blooded?<br/><br/>Nathan, thanks for the note on 3:16.

Aside from folks like Luke, who've built up an entire crew of talented people that help him playtest and release one product a year, I think people are going to be releasing a single product every 2-3 years, or maybe even less frequently.  That doesn't take into account the rising number of people being involved in producing games (my list above includes 4-5 first time publishers), but I think that's a significant force in slowing the speed of publishing.  Also, from talking a lot with members of the post-Forge crowd and seeing all the local play conventions sprouting up (JiffyCon, GoPlayNW, etc.), I get the sense that the indie roleplaying community is much more connected, person-to-person, than it used to be and, partially as a result, a sizable percentage of folks are spending more of their time happily playing other people's games instead of always playtesting something that they're working on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153677/#Comment_153677" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T09:50:00+00:00" title="June 29, 2008  9:50AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think 3:16 has been mentioned on these boards, I just stalk Gregor.<br/><br/>Also, I think we're at an interesting point in development where not only are designers taking longer to work on their games, but also there are enough functional games out there that people are happy to tweak or hack them, as opposed to write an entirely new game. ALSO, I think that many people are still playing the games that came out in the last year or two, and having more time to play before new hotness comes out is a very good thing. I know I still have two or three games on my shelf that haven't yet hit the table, and that sucks. I like feeling like I have time to experience games before another rockin' one comes along and distracts me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153679/#Comment_153679" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T10:04:05+00:00" title="June 29, 2008 10:04AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, more time to play games <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153681">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153681/#Comment_153681" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T10:32:18+00:00" title="June 29, 2008 10:32AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here's something I was thinking about today:<br/><br/>One of my favorite Japanese RPG tool/sites is "<a href="http://www.ps-hiroshima.com/rpg/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Playspace Hiroshima</a>", officially the name of a store out in Hiroshima, but they have the most up-to-date release catalog of upcoming RPGs, period.<br/><br/>I'm thinking of perhaps creating an ongoing list (maybe on the Wiki?) of RPGs/"Story Games" as they are released, or with their intended release date (or perhaps when they come out).  It would be kind of a catalog of everything, with no arguing over what qualifies or not. If Matt from Mongoose wants to drop his release schedule in there with the dirty hippie 1-page free RPGs that exist only on Blogs, then he's free to.<br/><br/>It would be like a focused "sonar" version of John Kim's site, basically. What's coming, what Just came out, etc.<br/><br/>I love the new hotness. Even if I don't buy/play it all, I like to know what's going on out there, on the off chance that there's something cool going on that might appeal to me, even if it's 1 in some 20 games. I only knew about 3 games listed in this thread, so for my own benefit I'm thinking of starting something like that.  <br/><br/>The Wiki would be the obvious place for it. I'm wondering if there's some other sort of software tool that I could implement to be a better mousetrap to log/organize releases... hmmm...<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153683/#Comment_153683" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T10:39:12+00:00" title="June 29, 2008 10:39AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 29, 2008 10:42AM by Graham.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you split the discussions off into separate threads?

Negotiation as conflict resolution.<br/><br/>My Life With Master. Fixed endgame. Very specific story structure. Epilogues. More Than Human and Less Than Human. The way the game addresses player empowerment. The slave/rebellion narrative, as opposed to the hero narrative. Group badguy creation. This is all brilliant and original.<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures. Simplicity, elegance, focused-yet-flexible. Primetime Adventures is a great game.<br/><br/>Shock: Social Science Fiction (alternately titled: how to facestab an alien who surrogated your child). Shock has cool pre-game stuff. Mutually inclusive stakes-setting is a brilliant and paradigm-shifting (for me) thought, and yet its such a small tweak to gaming-as-we-know-it. The interesting dynamic that appears over time, where Shock's dice seem to feel more and more like freeform, and less like die mechanics (ask me about it, if you'd like).<br/><br/>Beast Hunters. The fact that it's a combat game where actually striking the opponent is rare. The salute in and out. The way collaborative competition is addressed in the game. The fact that it is designed as a two player game.<br/><br/>Jason Morningstar's games in general. Lazer-focused. Often historical. Set scenes. Set characters. Constraint heavy. Focus on how you do something, instead of what you do (in my mind).<br/><br/>Breaking the Ice. GMless with singularly fixed roles. A game where both "sides" want the same thing. A game about romance. A two player game. Simple brilliance.<br/><br/>Those are, for my money, amazing and groundbreaking and original games. Though I might say that groundbreaking originality is often stale. There are a lot of games that feel strained to be groundbreaking, because that's the cool thing that kids to do impress Mr. Walmsley. I admit to doing that sometimes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153713/#Comment_153713" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-29T13:19:45+00:00" title="June 29, 2008  1:19PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: M Eryesen</cite>When there are times where there are not a lot of crazy new releases, I like taking the opportunity to revisit some from the past.

It's stretching out the entire process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153842/#Comment_153842" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T10:33:53+00:00" title="June 30, 2008 10:33AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert Bohl's "Misspent Youth" ought to be out by GenCon, and it's fucking hot.

Be sure to check this one out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
