My experience is pretty much limited to Engle Matrix Games, Universalis, and Blood Red Sands (and story-telling parts of FATE, PDQ, F# and the like).  So I'm familiar with the idea of using an "economy" as an "arbiter" in shared-GMing games like Universalis and BRS, since there's no central authority.  The economies I'm familiar with have some serious overlaps with money.  I was thinking about this with Blood Red Sands and came up with this thumbnail analysis:<br/><br/><b>BRS Is All About Power And Money</b>\n<ul>\n<li>Players have liquid assets (Dice Horde) and investments (traits and components)<br/></li><li>The current Chronicler can give other players some of his own liquid assets (Dice Horde) or the bank's (Boneyard) in exchange for depleting their investments<br/></li><li>A player can resist this by gambling with the Chronicler for control of the position using his own liquid assets (Dice Horde).  The loser gets the other's risked assets, unless the loser was the Chronicler and he was using assets from the bank, in which case the risked assets go to the bank.<br/></li><li>Players can use their investments to endanger other players' investments and may gain money (dice from battering) or power (victory points from devastating)<br/></li><li>Power feeds back into the system to create more money for Hero players and allow them more diversification (more traits)<br/></li><li>Investments with higher values are more effective than investments with lower values<br/></li><li>Chroniclers may pay players to refrain from using their investments (staying out of a scene)<br/></li></ul>\nI don't have a background in finance, but I'm guessing there may be deeper or at least better analogies.  I do wonder though if you could make a financial board game by separating the BRS mechanics from story telling.  There's a definite combat feel to just the mechanics, but I'm wondering if you could make a financial game that isn't TOO abstract.<br/><br/>Likewise, I'm wondering if you could graft story telling onto game mechanics from a financial game.<br/><br/>Do most or all shared-GMing games work by using an economy that's fairly close to money and investing or do a lot of them do more "egalitarian" things like just having players take turns, or is there some other way of regulating how players interact with the story?  For instance, I think FATE's economy supports exchanges (when you compel another character's aspect, you give them your fate point), but I don't think it really has an idea of "investing" to help get more money.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268873/#Comment_268873" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-25T14:33:46+00:00" title="April 25, 2010  2:33PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 25, 2010 2:34PM by wburdick.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess a more concise summary of BRS' economics is:\n<ul>\n<li>You have liquid assets and investments<br/></li><li>Liquid assets can be transfered between players<br/></li><li>Investments can be lost (devastated)<br/></li><li>You can use investments to get more money (battering) and also stuff (devastating for victory points) and higher value investments are more effective<br/></li></ul>\nThis seems pretty close to money to me.

The rules give a loose structure that gently guides everyone past the problems with freeform and points the group in the direction of what the game's about.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my reading of Grey Ranks, it looks kind of like structured freeform also. Haven't played it yet though.<br/>\n<br/>\nedit: Although now I've posted this, I'm wondering if I'm not flagrantly misusing the term 'structured freeform'...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
