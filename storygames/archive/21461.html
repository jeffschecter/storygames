Something that seems of real-world significance, like whether a criminal can juggle their competing efforts to get revenge and to get out of their life of crime.  (As opposed to the "Bill, the Time-Traveling Stegosaurus!" sort of compelling idea.)<br/><br/>Now let's say you want to feel, as much as you can, that you <i>discovered</i> the answer, as opposed to <i>invented</i> the answer.\n<ul><li>I can sit here right now and say something like, "I declare that he does get revenge, but it was always going to be tough to leave the life of crime, and the revenge thing blows any chance he might have had.  So in the end he's only briefly satisfied, and then it's back to the life of crime."  I answered the question I posed, but I didn't find that exercise very satisfying.</li>\n<li>I can also go through some sort of exercise to test the character and the situation, to see what emerges from a sequence of character decisions.  If this tells me something I wouldn't have simply mapped out from the beginning, I can find that very satisfying.</li></ul>\nSupposing that you feel similarly, what's your favorite way to go about it, in terms of your relationship to your character?<br/><br/>Do you like to act primarily as an author, scripting your character's next actions as you're inspired by the unfolding narrative?  Do you like to immerse so deeply into your character that you feel like you're there, experiencing events as them?  A mix of both at the right times?  Somewhere in between?

As I said there, I favor "author stance", overwhelmingly.<br/><br/>But first, a disclaimer: the way I understand "stance" accords with old-school Forge stuff, where stance was postulated to be fluid. Even when I say I "overwhelmingly" favor one, I'm of course still likely to use, like, all of them over a given session of play, probably switching every few minutes, even every few seconds - whenever I make a move, I can make it from any one stance, irrespective of the stance I made my previous moves from.<br/><br/>That said, when exploring a premise, when looking for <i>meaning</i> in a role-playing game (which really is my favorite thing to look for) I often make my moves from what they used to call "author stance" on the Forge - I try to put my character/s on a collision course with those moments of play that will actually highlight the premise, be those critically hard choices or merely tense one-to-one conversations.<br/>(Almost) in your words, I "like to act primarily as an author, scripting [my] character's next <b>action</b> as you're inspired by the unfolding narrative".<br/><br/>While I favor taking my time, and a slow build is very much to my taste, ultimately one has to trim the really "useless" parts, such as scenes where nothing happens that is even remotely relevant to the premise (I'm using "happens" in the broadest possible sense, as changes in a character's internal state are often as important to me as outwardly apparent events, if not more).<br/>In order to trim those useless parts and drive toward the real "meat" of the game, I'm very much OK taking action first, then looking for a-posteriori fictional, in-character causes (justifications) for those actions later. As long as the end excuses the means, so to speak, means to a preferred end can always be found.<br/><br/>Now, when quoting you two paragraphs ago I substituted "next action", singular, for "next actions", plural. My point being: I generally avoid thinking ahead, and focus on being in the moment, allowing myself to be surprised by what comes next. If a premise is a question, I really want to find out the answer, as opposed to bringing my own preexistent answer to the table! I want uncertainty.<br/>Luckily, in a RPG I have constant access to at least one very powerful source of uncertainty: the other players! The game's designer has probably provided some additional layers of uncertainty on top of that.<br/>As long as I only advance a step at a time, then I let all other players and the game's components and rules make their moves, I can never be certain where I will end up next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469694/#Comment_469694" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T00:32:51+00:00" title="February  7, 2018 12:32AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2018 12:33AM by Paul_T.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favoured approach is to set up as much of the character's interests/cares/passions ahead of time - thinking as an author! - so that I can simply play the character moment-to-moment within the actual scene or situation, as purely as possible.<br/><br/>However, as an additional wrinkle, I sometimes feel the character's emotions or interests keenly and intensely, but as an observer.

So no setting me a working quota, some question that I need to explicitly answer. Those things can be embedded into the situation my character experiences, without me having to care about them directly. "This character should express bravery" is no good, while "this character is threatened by things X and Y" is fine.<br/><br/>Second, the ideal in this regard is the moment of discovery, when my understanding of the character "comes together" into an intuitive whole and I understand naturally, without a conscious choice, what the character wants. This often requires us to play for  while; at the beginning you're just deducing your character's moves ("my character sheet says that I care about thing X, so I guess I'll make some choices to reflect that"), but at some point your hindbrain has enough to work with, and it constructs a "model of the mind" for the character. Once that happens you can understand on an intuitive level what the character wants, without having to make an authorship decision on it - you just know what "feels right" and sensible in the context of foregone events and what we know about the character.<br/><br/>(What I just wrote overlaps badly with all sorts of immersion theory. I'd prefer no assumptions about that, though, as I am undecided myself about whether I'm talking about immersion as understood in Nordic theory, or something else.)<br/><br/>In technical terms I've found that the stance that best facilitates this goal of achieving an intuitive understanding is the "advocation" stance, so named by myself because I wasn't quite happy with the traditional Forgite classification of stances. I suppose it's basically actor stance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469707/#Comment_469707" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T04:00:39+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  4:00AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 7, 2018 4:19AM by David_Berg.">edited February 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>at some point your hindbrain has enough to work with, and it constructs a "model of the mind" for the character.

I don't "go deep" in a way that would require other people to address me by my character's name (so as to not "break immersion") or anything like that, and I don't dwell on the subjective experience of "being my character" for lengths of time. It's more typical for me to jump up and vehemently deliver my momentary understanding of what my character wants, and then continue building on that realization in an intellectual way. It's a joyful moment of realization more than a continuous altered state of consciousness.<br/><br/>For example, years ago we were playing <i>Dust Devils</i> - this would have been in 2005, I think. My character was the only son of a farmer, but he was also an artist of some sort - painter, I think. A B-plot emerged during play about my character being pressured by filial piety on one hand, and his need for artistic self-expression on the other. The session was made memorable for me by the fact that in what was essentially the climatic scene of the scenario, I suddenly realized intuitively what my character wanted, why he wanted it, and what drove those feelings of his. (Specifically, part of why he hesitated to leave the farm was that he feared to "make the call" on his art and find out if he really has what it takes to become an artist. It is not an unfamiliar psychology for me personally, obviously.) This was directly brought about by the GM putting pressure on him, too - I was forced to choose what the character would do, right here, right now.<br/><br/>My reaction to that moment in play was to call for silence and explain to the other players exactly what I'd realized, and how my character needed to act towards his father. I also complimented the other players for the compelling scenario, and how vivacious and relevant it felt to me in that moment.

My character was the only son of a farmer, but he was also an artist of some sort - painter, I think. A B-plot emerged during play about my character being pressured by filial piety on one hand, and his need for artistic self-expression on the other. The session was made memorable for me by the fact that in what was essentially the climatic scene of the scenario, I suddenly realized intuitively what my character wanted, why he wanted it, and what drove those feelings of his. (Specifically, part of why he hesitated to leave the farm was that he feared to "make the call" on his art and find out if he really has what it takes to become an artist. It is not an unfamiliar psychology for me personally, obviously.) This was directly brought about by the GM putting pressure on him, too - I was forced to choose what the character would do, right here, right now.<br/><br/>My reaction to that moment in play was to call for silence and explain to the other players exactly what I'd realized, and how my character needed to act towards his father. I also complimented the other players for the compelling scenario, and how vivacious and relevant it felt to me in that moment. Then we continued play, me armed with a deeper understanding and appreciation of what my character was going through, exactly.<br/><br/>I often think of this kind of "character advocation" as a sort of externalized immersion experience: instead of the player "dropping off" into immersion at the moment of insight, he instead puts the experience into words for the benefit of the whole table.</p></div></blockquote>\nThis resonates with me as a great example of what I meant when I spoke about "looking for meaning" in RPGs!<br/><small>In case anybody's wondering (but I guess you aren't) this is the word "meaning" as used in the Process Model of Role-playing, a nice piece of ecumenic and straightforward Nordic (was it Finnish, perhaps?) theory-thought from the late 00s.</small><br/>I look forward to moments like that - both experiencing them and provoking them - as both a treat and a staple of successful (can I say) <i>story now</i> role-playing. Sometimes these also involve "bleed out" - that is, the realization had while playing comes with attached applicability to my current situation IRL and does affect the way I end up dealing with it.<br/><br/>I expect your vocalizing your insight to have enriched the experience of play for all other players - part of me thinks it's sad when people don't, but rather keep it all to themselves (although sometimes, with bleed involved, the very valid reason to keep it to yourself is that you feel it's something too personal to share in a gaming context). Notably, for forms of role-playing where we aren't supposed to break character - such as larp - I expect this sort of commentary to surface during the debriefing. In fact, when hosting a larp, I make a point of always including a debriefing phase, mainly because of this!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469722/#Comment_469722" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T14:34:09+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  2:34PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also love to mix debriefing with my immersive play.

Yeah, it makes sense, sure. It allows players to have more input overall (scene framing, scene content, events, etc) as opposed to let everything to the GM while the players only react. It can certainly help with addressing premise (not that I consciously care about that). But I'd still emphasise that it's essential that the players play their characters consistently in accord with their personalities and make choices that are logical for their characters.

Yeah, it makes sense, sure. It allows players to have more input overall (scene framing, scene content, events, etc) as opposed to let everything to the GM while the players only react.

But I'd still emphasise that it's essential that the players play their characters consistently in accord with their personalities and make choices that are logical for their characters.

I would like to add though that even if you take decisions for your character based on what you (as a player) know would be great for addressing the premise, that may spring your imagination so that you can retroactively motivate why the character did what they did. In that way you still make the character's behaviour consistent but the decisions can be more strategic (in order to address the premise).

Can't really help you there, I think. Fictional situations described verbally are quite different from being there in reality, so sometimes there's some "murk" regarding what exactly is going on and how that may affect a character in a given situation. This may be a bit worse if you also haven't really nailed down the character's personality yet.

I can make anything <i>look</i> "consistent", but if it isn't coming from some sort of emotional center, it doesn't mean much to me.  <br/><br/>Controlling a character to not be utterly nonsensical?  I think that's easy.<br/><br/>Making character decisions which emerge authentically from the situation?  I think that's only easy (or even possible) if approached the right way.<br/><br/>For me, that "right approach" is easiest in actor stance.  But what I'm reading in this thread indicates that the stance itself is probably not the largest part of this.  For example:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/APM" rel="nofollow">APM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It's just that sometimes I feel as if when I'm making decisions from my character's point of view, I'm unable to wrap my head around it. I mean I don't know what to do.</p></div></blockquote>My take is that if you are "in character" and your <i>character</i> doesn't know what to do, then they should follow through on that indecision and pay the consequences for it.  They fret, dither, avoid, hide, or distract themselves, and the GM (or whoever) describes how the situation gets worse while they're doing that.<br/><br/>But if it's simply that <i>you the player</i> don't know what your character would do, then clearly the attempt to get into character POV has failed.  "Let's use actor stance" doesn't magically get every player into the state where their gut takes over with authentic character reactions to every situation.<br/><br/>And if you do forge that intuitive embodiment of your character, apparently not everyone needs to be in actor stance when they make the resulting character choices.  (Or maybe they do, but only very briefly, and then they pop right back into author/director stance?)<br/><br/>Interesting stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
