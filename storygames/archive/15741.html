People who are knowledgeable about certain topics? Say JDCorely with Super Heroes, Vampire, Detective/Mystery Games? Or someone who drew/wrote/published something I enjoy? Someone who taught me something? Something else? All of the above? <br/><br/>When I read the forum threads, I don't read everything, and filter as much as possible. One of my filters is people whose opinions I respect over certain subjects. General if a thread is about something I care about, sounds interesting, has a lot of replies, or is by someone I know tends to say interesting things... I'll read it. Everything else depends on how much time I have. <br/><br/>On the front page, I've read 37 out of the 100 threads available. <br/><br/>The different background part is tough because in many cases I don't know what someone's background is online. But I do pay more attention to people who are different from me (age, gender, sexuality, location, culture, belief system) because different in many cases means something new. I feel the more perspectives I have in life, the better. That's why I like forums. Looking at the threads I generally read, this observation seems to hold up. <br/><br/>Regarding someone whose name I can hardly remember, that definitely makes it less likely I'll read a thread. There are after all 63 threads I haven't read on the front page. But there are also threads I've read from people I don't recognize because the topic is interesting. Sometimes I'll read a thread by someone I don't know, assuming they may be new to Story Games, to see what they have to say, and if I can contribute anything, to do so to help make them feel welcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357630/#Comment_357630" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T13:43:25+00:00" title="February  3, 2012  1:43PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will sometimes read a thread because I see someone's name whose comments I tend to like or agree with or find insightful.

Often it is earned.<br/><br/>But I'm *way* more likely to read a thread because I like the game it's about, or because the thread title is catchy or interesting. (I do email marketing as part of my job, and there is a vast chasm of stats and data and arguments about the value of subject lines).<br/><br/>Also, if I'm being honest, I'll sometimes read a thread that looks like it might contain fussing and conflict.

I don't know who anyone is or from what background they're approaching a topic and most other people don't have that information about me. I have to figure out what people are up to and how they think so I can express myself clearly and fit in (due to aforementioned status monkey behaviour.) Since I have been posting for a total of two days, I use a system of clumsy generalisations to read into what is going on, which I will now list as best I can for the interest value of the general public.<br/>\n<br/>\nThings That Are Cool:<br/>\n- Apocalypse World System<br/>\n- Being creative<br/>\n- Structure mirrors story<br/>\n- Being relaxed<br/>\n- Using standard punctuation<br/>\n- Being nice<br/>\n<br/>\nThings That Are Uncool:<br/>\n- Being belligerent<br/>\n- Aggression<br/>\n- Spoiling others' fun<br/>\n<br/>\nAuthorities (in my social model / gross generalisation) are people who post a lot, and people whose posts frequently receive positive replies. Basically, any regular is an authority. Other people typically fit into three categories: lurkers who occasionally post, unidentifiable new people (who have no grounding in the forum's social world), and 'cool new people' who probably know a regular or have a tangible link to something on the forum's Things That Are Cool list. (Fyi I don't compile these models. I am telling a folk story about what I think my brain is up to.)<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the moment, my thread-reading behaviour is driven largely by whether or not I think I will learn things about the community from the thread, or whether I will be able to participate in it. Both of these things increase my socialization to the community and allow me to accumulate cultural capital (at the risk of losing a lot of cultural capital if I do something Uncool.) Even presently, I am assessing whether this post is excessively weird or if I'm meant to post in  this thread. It's pretty strange analysing it as I do it. <br/>\n<br/>\nReading what's interesting definitely plays a big part, because if I didn't think that what people post here is interesting and valuable then I would have no reason to be status monkeying, and I just proved to myself that I am doing so. o.0                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biggles" title="biggles"><img alt="biggles" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biggles">biggles</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357713/#Comment_357713" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T00:23:46+00:00" title="February  4, 2012 12:23AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mean, immediately after posting that, I went "was that post too long?"

At the Forge I pick the threads I read on the basis of who's posting as well as the subject matter, while here it's all about the topic. This is probably because I'm here at SG just to shoot the breeze, and therefore just care about saying my piece on anything that seems interesting. At the Forge I read purposefully, because it's about work and goals and ambition. I couldn't have told you that Vanilla even shows you the thread starter before checking it out just now. And I certainly couldn't tell you who it was that wrote something in particular here, all the ideas and opinions just jumble together after a while; for some reason the people participating in the discussion aren't so important to me here, apparently.<br/><br/>Or actually, another theory of why I care more about the author at the Forge could simply be that the forum layout makes the author's name more prominent there. Having it in a separate column makes it as easy to skim the new threads by author name as by title.

I respect their ideas, and have been inspired by them; I think they're great game designers and theorists. At the same time, it is not possible for me to engage with them in the same way I engage with others on fora - there are huge issues of asymmetry, in that I have read and played a lot of their games, and know a lot about their thoughts (even their personal relationships, for chrissakes), while I'm pretty sure they only have a vague idea what I design and think. Also, as mentioned, I have authority issues, and it's hard to see what's real and what's not sometimes when talking to people I perceive as authorities.<br/><br/>McDaldno, thanks for being honest. I have a gender bias myself; I'm often interested in reading the thoughts of women, and assume they will listen more if I try to talk with them on S-G, but I do not see them as part of the "pecking order"/status hierarchy in the same way I see men (usually), which is sometimes a benefit and sometimes not. I believe this is true for many men, and I need to be conscious about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357907/#Comment_357907" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T14:48:08+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  2:48PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 5, 2012 2:48PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The first gate:</b> Am I interested in this topic?<br/><br/>Yes: I click in to read it, and only then do I see who wrote it.<br/>No: I move on without checking to see who wrote it.<br/>Maybe: Okay, now it really matters who wrote it.

What will convince me?<br/><br/>- Having said interesting things in the past, obviously.<br/><br/>- Having tangibly succeeded at the topic in question.  Even if you suck at explaining stuff, I'm still game to hear you try, because you've found a way to do something I want to do!<br/><br/>- Claiming success at the topic in question.  "Everyone loves my GMing," for instance.  I tend to believe such claims initially.  But if you don't then say anything interesting, I will gradually get un-convinced.<br/><br/>I, uh, am afraid I can't really tell what part of all that counts as authority.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357912">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357912/#Comment_357912" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T15:25:12+00:00" title="February  5, 2012  3:25PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ivan</cite>Detecting bias is great but..<br/><br/><b>Can we design to overcome bias?</b></blockquote>\nShould we?<br/>(Not a rhetorical question.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357955/#Comment_357955" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-05T23:21:36+00:00" title="February  5, 2012 11:21PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/rafu">@rafu</a><br/><br/>Authority bias can make sense.
