Character creation is always a hard one to explain. In claiming to be small-time rule-vendors, there also seems to be an expectation that we are The Source of Knowledge to anyone playtesting with respect to what to tell new players about how to put characters together and flesh them out. I feel like I'm somewhat experienced now and can get into character easily enough, but it's much harder to explain to other people what's going on in my brain. What made me decide that my mathematician should rationalise an alternate story for the whole campaign to protect himself from the idea that supernatural forces were raising the dead? How did my friend play his deeply insane cohort without realising that the character was mad? (We had to talk about it out-of-game for it to click with him.) Some of it sits in the hands of the GM, but the players are storytellers too, especially when it comes to their characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis thread is two-pronged:<br/>\n   1. What do you do to develop characters and get into their heads?<br/>\n   2. What do you tell people you're doing when they ask?<br/>\n<br/>\nThey seem like the same question, but what you say to someone to send them in the right direction isn't necessarily the whole truth.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy thoughts so far are pretty simple. I am a simple man.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Play characters with traits you don't like. Characters with mannerisms and beliefs that you are annoyed by or disagree with can easily gain a bit of emotional depth because of the conflict between player and character. People often do dislike things about themselves that they nevertheless accept. In tense or mucky situations, these conflicts can make for interesting character development as your goals for the character interact with their sense of identity.<br/>\n- Figure out how your character sees him/herself. People's ideas about what they're up to aren't the absolute truth, but they do have a close relationship with how they act. You probably see your character differently to how your character sees itself, much as if you encountered any other person.<br/>\n- Figure out what your character thinks they're doing. This is not their sense of identity, but their sense of place in the game-world. Fitting them into the game-world involves their explanations of what their motives are. As with identity, the character's perceptions of their motives might be quite different to your ideas about their motives and goals. This also serves to explain how their relationships with other people in the game-world play out. Especially strangers. History comes in here too but I have a habit of adding character history when it is convenient to me or I feel inspired.<br/>\n- If the rules have a character model, translate your character into a character sheet.<br/>\n- Favourite food: omelets.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is my approach (or at least what I think my approach is) but I bet that other people do completely different and probably better things. I want to hear about them!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357707/#Comment_357707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-03T22:51:42+00:00" title="February  3, 2012 10:51PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I start new players with Zombie Cinema.<br/><br/>I hand them some random cards and ask them to tell me about the character they see in the them.

It was a coincidence in that I had picked to write a tutorial module with a very lose description of what I thought was a cartoonish zombie game and the chap that ran it fleshed it out beyond my wildest expectations. We started with pretty basic, somewhat selfish characters, but the circumstances made them come to life. The first-timer was playing an uncaring, inwards banker who shot me to clear out zombies. That led to some really fruitful interactions. Then we all died. He did a lot better than I did when I started on DnD 3.5. Maybe zombie games work well for newbies because they're relatively simple and high-tension?

I play with people new to roleplaying pretty often and my preference is low handling time games with simple characters and some built in situation. <br/><br/>"You are a border drug dealer who owes Los Zetas some money"<br/>"You are a princess about to enter an arranged marriage to a man you hate" <br/>"You are a wizard seeking out a mysterious treasure"<br/><br/>Then give them lots of room and little guidance.

I guess you could use them to generate NPCs quickly in planning too.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhile people typically understand the notion of character, I don't think they typically understand the notion of roleplaying game characters. In drama, the character and their actions are typically already known. In improvisational drama, (as has been pointed out to me) the other 'players' must accept any offer you make. Character creation is either a matter of interpreting facts and actions, or entirely free-flowing. Typical roleplaying games impose structure in terms of the setting and the facts of the world, which are in the hands of the GM, but omit plot structure and the pre-planned character developments that come with it because of its nature as collective storytelling. Similarly, when character shows up in video games, the one you inhabit is the primary hero. That was my biggest issue when I started - not necessarily being central to the world. In video games, even time flows around your actions, but relationships and things going well are built into the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nThese preconceptions definitely form a notion of character, but it's not yet flowered with the nuances that let it interface with the pen and paper roleplaying game. I certainly don't think I had it right to start with. I think if I went back in time and told myself what I wrote in the OP, I would have done a slightly better job. Playing yourself is cool, but wearing a t-shirt in the middle ages gets awkward fast.  (The t-shirt is a metaphor for your enculturation.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357787">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357787/#Comment_357787" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T14:34:24+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  2:34PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, the more important thing to coach on is narration boundaries. New players are often tripped up by the fact that (in most games) they can't invent an NPC, narrate that NPC's responses, and play out both sides of a dialogue with that NPC.<br/><br/>It's important to communicate not only "you can't do that," but also "here's why doing it a different way is going to be more fun."<br/><br/>You can say something like, "The reason why this story is going to be fun is that it's going to be a mutual effort, at every step of the way. It's the back-and-forth nature of roleplaying that helps us create things bigger than what we could create on our own. To that end, whenever your character strikes up a conversation with another character - even one we just invented for this scene! - someone else is going to be in charge of narrating all the reactions and dialogue for that character. You'll be in charge of your half, someone else in charge of the other half. This helps make the story big, interactive, and unexpected. Those are our goals!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357791/#Comment_357791" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-04T15:14:18+00:00" title="February  4, 2012  3:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good point, Joe, and I hate it when a new player is "corrected" on what they are allowed to do and say. It breaks my heart, because their impulse is 100% correct - they are taking interest and ownership in a natural way that ought to be encouraged if re-directed.<br/><br/>I take a different approach to new players overstepping traditional (and, as you point out, often productive) boundaries. Typically I'll completely agree, go along with their author stance or whatever, and then strongly model optimal behavior for that game. Unless the person is totally oblivious to social cues they'll soon understand the appropriate boundaries without being called out, corrected, embarrassed. As people new to the activity they are actually <i>looking</i> for those cues.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
