The game contains a little introduction with the basics of a fantasy setting (of course, they're just an inspiration and not mechanically tied into the game).<br/><br/>You can have a look at the preview files here:<br/>- <a href="http://www.daimongames.com/foh/download/FOH-0-Introduction-v01.pdf" rel="nofollow">Introduction</a><br/>- the <a href="http://www.daimongames.com/foh/download/FOH-3a-The-Hero-v01.pdf" rel="nofollow">Hero playbook</a><br/>- the <a href="http://www.daimongames.com/foh/download/FOH-3e-The-Ranger-v01.pdf" rel="nofollow">Ranger playbook</a><br/><br/>The feedback I am looking for, at the moment, is about the advancements system built-in in the playbooks and the character creation system which is also contained in the playbooks.<br/><br/><b>If someone would like to see more, please write me</b> here in story-games or in mail ( davide.pignedoli@gmail.com ) and I'll be happy to share more with you (the full set of characters and additional instructions on running the game).<br/><br/>I don't need people to be 'FATE-gurus' to comment, but I am not posting -yet- the full package. I'd rather give it to 10 people and receive 5 comments than have 100 downloads and maybe 1 response :-) <br/><br/>Of course, feel free to comment on whatever is posted here if that's enough to tickle your curiosity! (I hope so...)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_444273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/444273/#Comment_444273" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-19T06:54:11+00:00" title="March 19, 2015  6:54AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If anyone is interested in having a look at the game, the beta material (in full: introduction and setting, rules and GMing Guide, plus playbooks) is up <a href="http://www.daimongames.com/fateofheroes.html" rel="nofollow">on my website</a> <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/146156/FATE-of-Heroes" rel="nofollow">and on RPGnow</a>, as PWYW.<br/>Any feedback is most welcome!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
