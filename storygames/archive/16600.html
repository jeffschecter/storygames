William, Keith, Will and Michael playing Within My Clutches, with me introducing the game and providing occasional guidance and rules clarifications.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 1, SCENE 1<br/><br/>King Orziman of Vorania (played by William) had set his sights on winning the adoration of Captain Metropolis (played by Michael), a famous American superheroine.  To prove his own heroism, he planned to save Captain Metropolis's home city from a falling meteor.  On schedule, the meteor arrived (thanks to Orziman's lackeys), and Orziman raced to meet it, only to be passed by Captain Metropolis herself!  Captain Metropolis couldn't stop the meteor completely, however, giving Orziman time to catch up and ready a mighty punch.<br/><br/>William rolled well, but not well enough to avoid a cost to his victory.  5 successes left him one shy of the required 6, leaving him to chose between the following for his 1-die Distraction:<br/><br/>1. Compromised achievement: Captain Metropolis will adore Orziman -- as her new sidekick.<br/>2. Tenuous achievement: Captain Metropolis notices the Voranian technology on the back of the meteor, and will only adore Orziman if he convincingly blames and purges his country's "corrupt" officials.<br/><br/>William chose the latter.  High maintenance and hanging by a thread was clearly the lesser evil -- King Orziman is no one's sidekick.  He also took some glee in blaming the various crimes of his tyrannical rule on bureacrats, generals, secretaries, and other underlings, and promising to weed out all who were corrupt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 1, SCENE 2<br/><br/>U.S. Secretary of Education Lawrence Steadman assumed his supervillain identity of Fugue (played by Keith) and attended the 80th birthday party of telekinetic arch-villain Dr. Omega (played by William).  The "party" was actually a queue of villains lined up in the throne room of Asteroid O to give gifts to the big man.  The stakes and standards were quickly established as high, when Dr. Omega scornfully replied to a gift by saying, "Only ONE velociraptor?" and activating the trap door beneath the well-wisher's feet, presumably sending him hurtling into space.<br/><br/>As Fugue approached the throne, he carried only an envelope.<br/><br/>When he reached Dr. Omega, he told him, quietly and nervously, respectfully and earnestly, that he could provide something no other villain could.  He would make a prediction come true.  The paper in the envelope simply said that star news reporter Mona Marks (a longtime critic of Omega) would be hit in the face with a pie on national TV tomorrow at 3:30pm.  Dr. Omega smiled and said, "We'll see."<br/><br/>The next day, Secretary Steadman appeared at the event he'd arranged, where Mona Marks read to a class of 3rd graders in support of Literacy Awareness, for a short news feature.  Steadman also made sure that the event's snacks included pie.  At 3:30, during Marks' reading, with the cameras rolling, Steadman (Fugue) focused his emotional manipulation powers on the child closest to the pie.  He turned the kid toward frustration and anger toward Marks, and then turned up the intensity until the kid had to lash out.  Boom, out of nowhere, pie to the face!<br/><br/>Back on Dr. Omega's asteroid, the giant dome had turned into a screen, on which the Doctor watched the pieing.  Keith rolled the dice, and got only two successes.  One Distraction option offered was that S.H.I.E.L.D. thought there was something odd about the pieing, was now investigating it, and spotted the nosebleed Steadman got from concentrating so hard on his power.  Keith was leery of buying 4 Distraction dice, but decided to go for it and accept the S.H.I.E.L.D. hunt.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 1, SCENE 3<br/><br/>Evil billionaire Robert "Coldblood" Mason (played by Will) sat by the pool on his yacht as his thugs escorted Mona Marks off a helicopter (Mona played by Keith, now that he wasn't playing another character sharing the stage with her).  Coldblood hoped to control the media coverage of his dealings so as to squash rumors of his criminality.  To this end, he offered Marks exclusive coverage of his corporation's humanitarian aid efforts in Africa, while keeping the intimidation subtle and unspoken.<br/><br/>Will rolled 3 successes, and opted for the 3-die Distraction that Mona would consider anything less than a billion a year as an insincere token gesture.  Coldblood agreed, but it was established that this cost would hamper his other operations.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 1, SCENE 4<br/><br/>Jared Bruckner, secretly Captain Fahrenheit (played by Michael) stood at the ATM, growing enraged as he learned his account was empty.  As he lost his temper, he accidentally melted the machine into slag.<br/><br/>Bruckner then proceeded to buy some flowers and head to his former home, where his estranged wife, Mona Marks, still lived. Fahrenheit thought he could win back her adoration with good old romantic wooing and promises to change, but Mona hated his villainy and blamed his powers.  She just wanted her Jared back, for them to be together they way they were before his powers interfered.  She mentioned a Dr. Blenheim, with a new treatment that could remove superpowers.<br/><br/>Michael rolled 3 successes.  He listened to his Distraction options, and chose the Tenuous option: Mona would take him back under the belief that he was getting his powers removed; but he wasn't, and if she ever found out, it'd be over.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 2, SCENE 1<br/><br/>Ha ha, King Orziman has won the adoration of Captain Metropolis!  Time to revel!  He took her on a tour of the "cleaned up" pieces of the country, showing how he'd punted his latest corrupt official (i.e. scapegoat).  Metropolis showed some hesitation and insistence for continued reform, but by the end of the scene was expressing how much she admired how much Orziman had changed.  Mwahaha.  Quick cuts to dinner in Italy, dessert in Prague, and the couple heading for some privacy in the Fortress of Solitude.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 2, SCENE 2<br/><br/>Fugue chose to deal with his 4-point distraction of being hunted by S.H.I.E.L.D.  He met with Nick Fury and demanded an investigation into the real culprit behind the pie throwing, deflecting attention off himself. He blamed a robot/cyborg infiltrator among the children and used his secretary rank to order Fury to search both 3rd graders and 1st graders.  Fury obeyed and wound up looking like an idiot to his superiors, who replaced him with Corporal Mick Rage, effectively putting Fugue outside Fury's reach.  <br/><br/>Keith rolled well, lowering his distraction down from 4 dice to 1.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 2, SCENE 3<br/><br/>Coldblood also decided to deal with his distraction, deciding to recoup parts of his billion-dollar investment by recruiting the warlords of the African nations he was aiding, thus bringing revenue and formidable manpower into his criminal empire.<br/><br/>Will only rolled one success, bumping the distraction down from 3 to 2.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 2, SCENE 4<br/><br/>Captain Fahrenheit had conceived a plan to hold the world for ransom by threatening to cook it, if only he could boost his powers.  He needed Dr. Omega's wealth to fund a power-enhancer.  Fahrenheit boldly entered Asteroid O, and there was some quality posturing and power-use on both sides.<br/><br/>Captain Fahrenheit (trying to bring up the problem of global warming): "What I'm trying to say is: What is the greatest threat facing the world today?"<br/><br/>Doctor Omega: "Me."<br/><br/>Keith also jumped in to play Dr. Omega's accountant-like lackey.  "This guy's not on the rolls, boss."<br/><br/>Michael rolled only 1 success.<br/><br/>William proposed the Compromised option: "Dr. Omega values your power, but wants it at his command, by keeping you in a box."  The Risky option was no better, and Michael was staring down 5 Distraction dice, so the Goal went un-acheived.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379901">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379901/#Comment_379901" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T04:15:13+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  4:15AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2012 4:24AM by David_Berg.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ROUND 3, SCENE 1<br/><br/>King Orziman went to a general assembly of the United Nations, seeking to gain control over his country's international trade by ending a U.N. embargo.  Vorania had ostensibly gone legit and the King demanded that they lift the blockade.<br/><br/>William rolled 6 successes and achieved his goal with no Distraction.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 3, SCENE 2<br/><br/>Fugue attempted to ally with The Web so they would keep his money safe and secret.  The Web asked Fugue to cause problems for the family of one of the school children, a 1st grader whose father was the Senator of Iowa, and someone The Web wanted to remove or control.  No cyborgs had been found in the 3rd grade population, so Fugue demanded that the probe be expanded to 1st graders.  Fugue instructed Corporal Rage to particularly investigate the Senator's child. <br/><br/>The Distraction that Fugue wound up with was that Rage himself came under investigation for messing with the Senator, with this investigation threatening to expose Fugue's involvement in Piegate.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 3, SCENE 3<br/><br/>In order to stop Captain Metropolis' history of disrespectful taunting, Coldblood decided to confront her with inescapable proof of the true length of his reach. He pulled some strings and arranged to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his African relief efforts and for the award presenter to be Captain Metropolis herself.<br/><br/>Will rolled poorly, but opted for the 6-point distraction nonetheless, with the caveat that Coldblood will need to be extra cautious to stay one step ahead of Captain Metropolis, who's now watching him closer than ever.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 3, SCENE 4<br/><br/>Captain Fahrenheit attempted to deal with his distraction, telling Mona all about how he cared about her social justice causes and would have happily used his powers to combat global warming. He was hoping to set her up to eventually reveal that he hadn't taken the treatment so that he could get away with that.<br/><br/>This scene had a great intro, with Mona nestled under a blanket in an under-heated apartment waiting for the hot water to boil for her tea, and Fahrenheit subtly mentioning, "Y'know, this didn't used to be an issue..."<br/><br/>Alas, poor Michael rolled 0 successes, leaving the 3-point distraction undiminished.<br/><br/><br/><br/>MASTER PLAN SCENES<br/><br/>I can't remember when exactly each of these were called for and played out.  I think there were a bunch around the end of Round 3 and the beginning of Round 4, so I'll list them here.  Michael was racking up the "good GMing" points and called for 3 scenes, while I think everyone else got 1.  Keith also earned a bonus Master Plan scene of his own by tallying 5 "fan points" for Fugue.<br/><br/>What we saw of the master plans:<br/><br/>2 Plans Conceived<br/>3 Plans Advanced<br/>1 Plan Hitting a snag<br/>1 Plan Hindered by Distraction<br/>Possibly more that I lost the cards for<br/><br/>What I remember:<br/><br/>- Orziman sitting on his throne deciding he needs an heir.<br/><br/>- Coldblood having enough money to live forever, and ambitions to match, but lamenting that he's probably only got 50 years left.  Then he summons his top scientists.<br/><br/>- Fugue was shown smiling as the legislation digitizing all standardized testing passed.  Then we saw Fugue sitting in a room with a million ScanTron sheets, filling them out.<br/><br/>- Coldblood's lab, with displays of high tech and altered organic compounds.<br/><br/>- Fahrenheit connecting the dots between Mona's causes and his powers.<br/><br/>- It turned out that Nick Fury had been a sleeper agent for The Web and, in removing him from power, Fugue had inadvertently weakened The Web's power as an ally and their ability to keep S.H.I.E.L.D. off his back.<br/><br/>- Due to the Distraction of pursuing (fake) justice in Vorania, Orziman and Metropolis have not yet consumated their marriage.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 4, SCENE 1<br/><br/>King Orziman reveled in Vorania's newfound prosperity.  Great factories churned out robots that reduced human drudgery by doing crappy work for the tahnkful people of Vorania.  Captain Metropolis was delighted with the golden age that Orziman was ushering in.  William rolled 3 successes, earning 3 Moxy to take into his Final Roll.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 4, SCENE 2<br/><br/>Fugue attempted to deal with the Sgt. Rage investigation by telling S.H.I.E.L.D. Command that his ousting of Fury had merely been a gambit to fool the bad guys who thought Fury was working for them. Fury is actually a triple agent and must be reinstated to continue his work on the Pie investigation. <br/><br/>Keith rolled 2 successes, bumping his distraction down to 3.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 4, SCENE 3<br/><br/>Coldblood decided to deal with Captain Metropolis' scrutiny.  He had a conversation with her about his new employees from Africa.  I can't remember whether he was allaying her suspicions by claiming he was giving employment to the needy, or whether he was intimidating her with the extent of his power ("I got WARLORDS working for me!  Take that!").<br/><br/>Will rolled well, knocking the distraction down from 6 to 3.<br/><br/><br/><br/>ROUND 4, SCENE 4<br/><br/>With a 3-point distraction and only one turn left (thanks to our shortened session, we had 4 turns instead of 5), Michael had no choice but to go for his 2nd goal of gaining Dr. Omega's assistance for his big scheme.  We had to rush the scene, and went quickly to the roll.  Michael's poor luck continued: 2 successes, for the 4-point Distraction that he was now working for Dr. Omega. I don't think he was in the Box; I think he was just sort of "on call." <br/><br/><br/><br/>FINAL SCENE 1<br/><br/>Orziman took 3 Moxy into this final roll, with just 1 Distraction die. He couldn't lose. William narrated how Captain Metropolis gave birth to his heir, a golden glowing god child who by the age of 5 was leading Orziman's robot armies in world conquest. Poor Captain Metropolis was neutralized from interfering because, y'know, that's her son.<br/><br/><br/><br/>FINAL SCENE 2<br/><br/>Keith had a chance, with 1 moxy and 4 dice, to at least succeed in his Master Plan, though he'd probably lose a previous achievement. As it happened, he rolled well, losing only his connection to The Web to guard his money (I think.  Was there some thing about Fury being a triple-agent?).  Fugue achieved his Master Plan, which was to control the world's children.  It was decided that his place in the new world order would be as Orziman's Minister of Youth (positioned to depose Orziman one day).<br/><br/><br/><br/>FINAL SCENE 3<br/><br/>Coldblood's research facility, which included radiation and genetic experimenting in an effort to produce a serum that would grant him immortality, wound up needing help due to budget cuts (billion-dollar African aid).  The help came from none other than Dr. Omega.  When the serum was completed, Coldblood prepared to drink it, but the dice did not go Will's way.  Dr. Omega arrived, telekinetically took the serum from Coldblood's hand, drank it himself, and shot Coldblood in the chest for good measure.<br/><br/><br/><br/>FINAL SCENE 4<br/><br/>Poor Michael had 7 dice and I think he'd spent all his moxy.  He needed a miracle and he didn't get it. He narrated how climbed to the top of a tall building and attempted to use his power to cool the earth and reverse global warming. This was his Master Plan, to both demonstrate his power as a hostage master villain and win Mona's heart for saving the world. Instead, he overextended his power and all he wound up freezing was himself. <br/><br/>With Captain Fahrenheit left as a frozen statue atop a mighty building, the game came to an end.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379902/#Comment_379902" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T04:32:02+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  4:32AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was a single session.

In the past, I've seen players pick the player who controls the relevant Guest Star to GM for them; or, I've seen them deliberately pick someone else, planning to pass GMing off to the Guest Star owner later.<br/><br/>At Nerdly, picking a GM seemed mostly based on giving play time to whoever'd had the least of it recently.  (Though when a scene obviously was going to start with a Guest Star on stage, that Guest Star's player did tend to get picked.)<br/><br/><b>Supporting characters:</b><br/>Keith jumped into a scene where he had no explicit role, portraying Dr. Omega's dorky assistant and really contributing a lot to bringing the scene to life.  The next time Omega was on screen, he brought that character back.<br/><br/>Doing this requires a good deal of self-control, to contribute to the scene without getting in the way of how the GM and spotlight player are progressing the scene forward and showing off the spotlight character.  None of my players back home have attempted this.<br/><br/><b>Sharing a Guest Star:</b><br/>In my home group, whenever a Guest Star was key to a scene's progress, the player elected to GM would play that Guest Star, regardless of whether they "owned" the Guest Star or not.  So if GMing moved around in a scene, so would who played the Guest Star.<br/><br/>At Nerdly, each Guest Star was portrayed only by the player who "owned" them (that is, had that Guest Star defined on their character sheet).  There was a significant upside to this, which was that 3 of 4 players were able to really invest in these characters: William, Keith and Michael had a lot of fun with Dr. Omega, Mona Marks and Captain Metropolis.  Will didn't get to do much with The Spider, agent of The Web, as he only appeared in one scene, being forgotten in another.<br/><br/>The downside of Guest Star ownership was that some GMs didn't get to GM much.  I believe William was called on to GM for Coldblood's scene with Mona, and he had fun setting the scene (yacht with a pool on it!), but then he didn't get to do anything once the two characters started talking to each other.  That's just one example; this happened other times.  <br/><br/>Accordingly, a lot of Story Points (aka "good GMing" points) were earned for good play of Guest Stars rather than for GM-style world narration.  This is not a problem at all, it's just worth noting that slightly different skills wind up being rewarded.  I wonder if that's a useful dial for different groups to set depending on their tastes and strengths?<br/><br/><b>Forgetting a Guest Star:</b><br/>How did the Spider get forgotten?  When I pre-generated the characters, the "Control" Goal I wrote for King Orziman was "wants to convince international puppet-master conspiracy The Web to end the United Nations blockade of Vorania."  William focused on the ends here, and just jumped to the most direct means: "I go to the U.N., show them my noble deeds from last scene, and demand they lift the blockade!"  So Will never got to play his Web character here, which was a bummer for him.<br/><br/>This may be a risk of pre-generated Goals.  I may need to remind players to make Goals their own and create reasons why the method listed is in fact the best way to get what they want.  During my intro, I encouraged players to customize their Goals if they wanted, but perhaps I should clarify that such rewrites must meet certain standards, and that this shouldn't be confused with "improv whatever you want".<br/><br/><b>Who gets the first shot to propose Risks and Compromises?</b><br/>My home group usually gave the first shot to the player who was currently in the GM role.<br/><br/>At Nerdly, that happened some (there were one or two "Who's GMing now?" moments in attempts at fairness), but much of the time the opportunity went to whoever had just been talking and roleplaying (so, the Guest Star player).<br/><br/>Proposing a Risk or Compromise is an opportunity to earn Story Points.  If you think of a good one, you get a point; if the spotlight player doesn't like yours, they can request another option from someone else.  It's not vital for this to be 100% equitable, but the more balanced the opportunities, the better.  A more aggressive player pouncing on opportunities at the expense of a less aggressive player would be a bummer.  I'm not sure whether an explicit system is needed here or whether it's fine to let this be a social issue.  This is related to the purpose of Story Points, which I'll touch on in a later post. <br/><br/><b>Passing GMing:</b><br/>In 16 scenes, there was only one moment where the active player felt stuck.  At that point, I reminded them of the "award a Story Point to pass GMing" rule, and it worked great.  But that option had utterly dropped off everyone's radar.<br/><br/>In my home group, players (spotlight players and GMs) hit snags and request new GMs all the time!  I think the Nerdly crew simply included more players with GM experience.  Or maybe I just explained the rationale for GMing better: your goal is to give the spotlight player an opportunity to achieve their Goal.<br/><br/><b>Reveling:</b><br/>Several times at Nerdly, a player included a Guest Star in their Reveling scene, and the Guest Star's player jumped into the role.  This tended to disrupt the pure revelry; the scene grew more detailed and vivid, but the clear tone of Moxy-building celebration became tenuous.<br/><br/><b>Dice:</b><br/>The luck of the dice is pretty swing-y.  Picking a strategy for when to Revel, Attempt, and Deal makes a difference, but in a short game that difference is somewhat drowned out by random chance.  There's not a ton of incentive to be strategic, but that's okay; it's an option for players who like that sort of thing, not a key to the play experience.  The key is really to go into a scene with an objective that makes for good supervillain fiction, and I think that's been achieved.<br/><br/>This are my main system observations.  I'm curious to see how it appeared to the players!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379957/#Comment_379957" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T12:18:00+00:00" title="May 28, 2012 12:18PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Michael Miller shared his thoughts <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=379810" rel="nofollow">here</a>:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Michael S. Miller</cite>I admit I was still a bit unclear as to what we were getting GMing tokens<i>for</i>and why being able to buy more cards was good. I also don't recall what we were getting villain tokens<i>for</i>, beyond a vague "entertaining the table." I certainly don't remember what we could spend the villain tokens on, because I only ever got a few, Captain Fahrenheit being the Charlie Brown of supervillains.<br/><br/>Maybe instead of squeezing the "How to GM" rules into a corner of the sheet, you have a half-sheet or card that has them on it. And one of the things you can get a token for while GMing is reincorporating a previous happening, or introducing one of the other villains. You can also simply say that villains that are guest-starring in scenes cannot earn villain tokens, but<i>may</i>earn GM tokens.<br/><br/>Also, I'd really suggest two colors of token. I found it confusing to keep track of villain tokens vs. GM tokens. Unless you put in a strict record-keeping phase at the end of every turn, it's going to get forgotten.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the game, though and am looking forward to seeing more of it.</blockquote>\n<b>Tokens:</b><br/>I'm trying to make this game as non-demanding as possible in terms of props -- no notecards, no token colors, one sheet per player -- but my Villain/GM Points did seem to trip people up.  My intent was that you keep your GM tokens (until you get 5, at which point, buy a card) and instantly return your Villain tokens (just marking them on the box on the sheet).  But there is a moment where you're in the middle of roleplay and don't feel like checking boxes and returning tokens, and in that moment a Villain token can get confused with a GM token.  Perhaps what I should do is just list solutions, so each group can pick whichever they prefer:<br/>1) 2 token colors<br/>2) GM tokens on your right, Villain tokens on your left<br/>3) check the boxes and return the tokens while you roleplay<br/><br/><b>Story points:</b><br/>As for the point of GM tokens, it's author power.  The more people dig your contributions (which is what gets you tokens), the more you get to dictate what the story covers.  Specifically, you get to call for Master Plan vignettes.  You were actually the biggest earner of GM points, and if I remember correctly, you called for some scenes that were very cool and well-timed.  So the token rules certainly seemed like they were working from my perspective.  Token-earning isn't really intended as a strong incentive in itself; more a means of recognition and a small bonus.  I think it also reinforces the collaborative goals of play beyond the "my guy winning" aspect.  Does that sound compatible with your experience?<br/><br/>Do you think that message might be confounded a bit by the fact that I codified a few types of contributions that <i>Dave</i> feels are valuable to the group (viable Distraction options, and opportunities to roll a Goal Attempt), so you <i>always</i> get GM points for contributing those?  I could ditch the auto-award and just instruct players "when someone offers you a good Distraction option, that's a perfect time to award them a token"...<br/><br/>Or, like you said, I could just lay it out better, so it isn't squeezed onto the bottom of the character sheet.  New layout is definitely needed in any case.  A list of auto-awards could definitely include things like integration or reincorporation.  As for bringing in other player characters, well, maybe, but see my concerns addressed to Wilhelm.<br/><br/><b>Fan Points:</b><br/>As for Villain points, the idea there is that it's a more specific type of authorial reward -- namely, "we like what you're doing <i>with this character</i>".  Accordingly, instead of spending points on other characters' Master Plan scenes, you can spend <i>these</i> on your <i>own</i>.  Plus you get Moxy to help you succeed in your Final Roll.  The name I use for these is actually "Fan Points", and I hope that reflects this concept.  The audience members are fans of this character, and want to see them more.  (There's an optional multi-story rule that says whoever has the most Fan Points gets to return for the next story, while everyone else must make new characters.)  <br/><br/>Right now you need 5 points to get anything, and maybe that's too many.  I'm thinking most people should get 1 master plan scene, with someone occasionally getting 2 or very occasionally 0.  An average of 7 points, perhaps.  Our group got 3,3,4,5... in rather rushed and abbreviated play.  So maybe it's about right after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CallMeWilliam" title="CallMeWilliam"><img alt="CallMeWilliam" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CallMeWilliam">CallMeWilliam</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379985/#Comment_379985" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-28T16:47:13+00:00" title="May 28, 2012  4:47PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 28, 2012 5:05PM by CallMeWilliam.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For those tuning in, I'm William the aforementioned player of King Orziman. I created an account to post on this thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think David mentioned the voting mechanic; the table votes on whether or not the scene seemed to work. This would grant +1d6 to the roll if a majority felt it should work.  This made it feel like the role playing and scene setting were important to the system.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, retrospectively, a single d6 didn't make a huge amount of difference. Maybe those should be more dice.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's what I've got for now. This was a lot of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
