Strange tastes and reactions from the servants and citizens.<br/><br/>However when anyone notices this and says it aloud the first reaction of any bystanders is to celebrate and applaud the fact that something new and unique is going on, adjudicate it to the unexpected talent of some servants at improvising new fun and mysterious experiences for the citizens and honestly congratulate the person who find out for their fine taste and sensibility. Denial at it's best.<br/><br/>-Odd smells, noises, textures and tastes, clouds of flies at the edge of perception; but whenever people focus on it they can't find anything wrong or out of place. It either disappears, changes or turns out to be something else.<br/><br/>-A servant opens their mouth and a cloud of butterflies pops out. Yes, those would be flies on the real world.<br/><br/>-Some servants may look like they are wearing costumes to make them appear as fake automata while sticking to their role. The illusion may make them appear as real automata when they fall to pieces. May work as a red herring.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila" title="PetteriHannila"><img alt="PetteriHannila" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila">PetteriHannila</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465195/#Comment_465195" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-31T17:48:23+00:00" title="July 31, 2017  5:48PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Who knows the real state of affairs before the player characters find out?<br/><br/>Perhaps just a small elite who controls everything.

And I like your take on the locals brushing off odd discrepancies as fun new diversions. <br/><br/>I plan on having the servants eat someone alive in front over everyone, with no one really knowing what is going on (including the person being eaten) or even really caring. Maybe it looks like they are disrobing in some strange performance, but the person has disappeared at the end of the 'show'...<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/PetteriHannila">@PetteriHannila</a> - I figure the citizens know that they live in a dream world but they try to keep it a secret from visitors (who are VERY rare). They are ashamed their city has fallen into ruin and use the drug to keep up appearances. Something bad happened in the city a few generations ago (blighted the city, killing off the peasantry and ruining the landscape) and they've had to use extreme measures to survive.<br/><br/>What they DON'T know is exactly how bad things have gotten in the City of Sorrows (the real world). There are supposed to be some bureaucrat-necromancers running the show back in the City of Sorrows and the undead servants are supposed to be mindless automata. Unfortunately the undead have 'evolved' (mutated?) and are openly defying the necromancers. <br/><br/>The Dreamers are too wrapped up in their galas and orgies to check in on the City of Sorrow and the Necromancers don't wanna admit they've lost control and so haven't bothered to tell the Dreamers anything is wrong.

Undead workforce creating food and keep the streets clean, etc. But the city was still in shambles and they didn't want to live in a ruin for the years it would take to rebuild so they created the Dream as a shared Utopian vision they could all live in while the Servants fixed everything up.<br/><br/>Over time the citizens became more and more invested / addicted to the Dream; it was SO much better than life ever was before the Disaster. They've pretty much abandoned the idea of ever turning it back off. A whole generation has grown up now in the Dream. Now the current Dreamers consider the City of Dreams to be 'more real' than the City of Sorrows (the real world). It's all just a mental cop out, really.<br/><br/>Meanwhile the Servants have gone off the freaking rails; they've started become self aware and they've stopped repairing the (real) City. And treating the Dreamers like cattle. Some of the Necromancers (that were put in charge of the city have fled into the Dream, others are desperately trying to get control back of the Servants and do their job, others have sided WITH the Servants.<br/><br/>The Necromancers aren't evil liches, they are more like low level civil servants who happen to know some basic necromancy, and are in way over their head in all this.<br/><br/>The Servants produce the food (gross slop they make in big alchemical vats, mix of vegetable waste and animal parts) and farm the flower that makes the drug. <br/><br/>The Necromancers actually distill the drug from the flowers (too complex for the Servants, but no more difficult than distilling alcohol, nothing magical about the process)<br/><br/>Both the alchemical food vats and the drug producing flower were invented by some local biomancers, whipped up in the early days after the Disaster. <br/><br/>None of this was supposed to be a permanent solution, in time the food production would totally break down anyway. The vats won't last forever. "Luckily" the city's population has been decreasing ever since the Disaster so it hasn't been a problem yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H" title="Tam_H"><img alt="Tam_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H">Tam_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465216/#Comment_465216" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-31T23:44:32+00:00" title="July 31, 2017 11:44PM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So... what if one of the sentient Servants decides to make a power play?

For example, the Servants might decide the best way to deal with it is to eat as many humans as possible, until there are so few that the remaining drug stockpile will be sufficient.<br/><br/>What kind of scene/encounter does that inspire?<br/><br/>The higher-ups, meanwhile, may attempt a different solution - how about creating a separate space where the Lucid (people who see reality) are taken? A part of the city which reveals its true nature, where only the Lucid live.<br/><br/>They can try to "sell" this reality to these "awakened" people by showing them that it's the truth - sure, it's horrible, but would you rather live in a fake dream world? Make them feel superior in their new knowledge.<br/><br/>Ultimately, like in the Matrix, it could be in the interests of the Administration (Necromancers, did you call them?) to set this up and make it LOOK like a rebellion or resistance movement. (Except it would make more sense than the Matrix!)<br/><br/>2. What are the effects of withdrawal from this drug?<br/><br/>If they are obvious, what do people going off the drug look like to those on it? How is this interpreted or rationalized? (Euphoria?)<br/><br/>Of course, those people always disappear shortly thereafter...<br/><br/>That's an odd detail to throw in there.<br/><br/>3. Imagine a few things which have to happen in the "real" city. Garbage collection? People dying of starvation? Buildings collapsing? People overdosing?<br/><br/>Try to figure out what they "look" like to those on the drug. Use that as a "weird" encounter or scene!<br/><br/>A dozen people wander down the street, which collapses under them, killing them all, and then someone comes to clean up the bodies. What does that all "look" like to those on the drug?!? How does the mind rationalize it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465233/#Comment_465233" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-01T15:25:01+00:00" title="August  1, 2017  3:25PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All good thoughts and it makes me think there' some serious campaign potential here. I THINK this is gonna end up being a short adventure though, so I dunno if I'm gonna flesh out 'what's really going on' and keep this a 'horror story'. Players won't be sticking around long enough to learn all the factions and long term consequences.<br/><br/>They PCs are gonna arrive in the city, get drugged up, attend some parties, see some weird stuff, see some horror stuff, slide into the creepy ruined city that lurks just under the skin of the world, and hopefully escape with their lives. If they like the setting I can leave it open for them to return (and in that case I'll build out the factions and the relationship web).<br/><br/><b>Things I'll definitely do:</b><br/><br/>Make the Servants alluring but off-putting (GOD I hope a PC tries to sleep with one of them)<br/><br/>Describe the citizens as disaffected elegant, decadent poet-kings and later as stumbling junkies wearing rags and muttering nonsense to themselves.<br/><br/>Describe the food as wondrous, and later show they were eating rotten garbage.<br/><br/>Have the Servants eat someone alive in front of the PCs. If I'm lucky one of the PCs will accidently join in.<br/><br/>Empty children's beds.<br/><br/>The city seems surprisingly underpopulated.<br/><br/>Some assault where someone throws something in a PCs face (and the world 'melts away' a bit, pulling them half out of the Dream)<br/><br/>Have the PCs find a way to shake off the Drug, quick adventure in the City of Sorrows: <br/><br/>Garbage fill streets, stagnant sewers, gaunt pale skinned 'Servants' feasting on a bloated corpse in the middle of a ruined dance floor, surrounded by swaying junkies), black robed Administrators lurking in the shadows, some helping, others attacking the party.<br/><br/>PCs find the mcguffin they were sent to get, and flee the city.<br/><br/>'The Matrix' meet 'The Congress' meets '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City_%26_the_City" rel="nofollow">The City and The City</a>' meets 'Silent Hill'                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H" title="Tam_H"><img alt="Tam_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tam_H">Tam_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465238/#Comment_465238" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-01T16:47:57+00:00" title="August  1, 2017  4:47PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 1, 2017 4:48PM by Tam_H.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jacob" rel="nofollow">Jacob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/><br/>Make the Servants alluring but off-putting (GOD I hope a PC tries to sleep with one of them)<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Have the Servants eat someone alive in front of the PCs.

My group would not be pleased at such trickery; I would be thrilled. Different strokes and all that.<br/><br/>Side thought; what if the person who can see the patchy illusion after being assaulted can share the effect, say, by touch? Then your other players can choose if they want to be free or not. It might be a nice mechanical challenge too; how do we do the things we do without letting go of Bob's hand?
