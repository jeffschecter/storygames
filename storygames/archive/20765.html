I'm planning on running a module called <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_7diDlHsFCXWndmNEVBMGR4OXM/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">The World Above</a>. The plot is basically a bunch of Wall-E style robots transport a rocket from a space center through some obstacles to a launch pad and then take off it in towards a space station.<br/><br/>It went okay but I think it could have been better with some stronger character motivations and tighter relationships. I'm going to make pregen characters and I'd like them to be easy to latch onto for drama and interactions. <br/><br/>The one relationship that was really strong in my playtest was one robot whose purpose was to reprogram other robots and another robot who had been on the list to be reprogrammed. The reprogrammee didn't like reprogramming so the reprogrammer would have to hide it from him any time he wanted to.<br/><br/>Because they're robots and not humans I'm struggling to come up with good motivations and relationships for my pregen characters. Any ideas or references to look at?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456004/#Comment_456004" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-03T21:29:23+00:00" title="September  3, 2016  9:29PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Wall-E is actually a perfect place to look.  The robots have a nice mix of human motives, "obey programming" motives, and kinda-human but via-robot/childlike-understanding motives.  They're searching for meaning and purpose and companionship and to have or emulate nice things they've seen or heard of.  They're looking to fulfill their functions, but also for enough freedom to go beyond that when a contrary urge develops.  As they witness or experience dramatic action, they learn and grow -- Eve goes from pure functionary to compassionate striver when exposed to Wall-E's lovable and admirable actions over time.<br/><br/>I'm not sure why you've chosen to do robots, but that seems like a perfect way to do it, to me.<br/><br/>If there's some other angle you're going for with robots, maybe clue us in?<br/><br/>Reprogamming sounds interesting!  On the "robots changing other robots" angle, you could try physical modifications, body-switching, merging multiple robots into one, memory wipes/implants, skill uploads, specific behavioral mandates and general obedience mandates (two types of reprogramming).

I see there's a place to note down "original purpose," but I'm not finding that touched on in the character creation rules. <br/><br/>Wall-E seems like absolutely the most defining piece of source material, and I think the beauty of the characters there comes from a tension between two components:<br/><br/>(1) The robot's designed purpose or function,<br/>and (2) some sort of transcendent desire that pushes the robot beyond (or into conflict with) its designed purpose.<br/><br/>For Wall-E, the designed purpose is to clean up and compact garbage, but he has a transcendent curiosity that drives him to collect and treasure garbage that he should be building trash towers out of.<br/><br/>The attraction of these robots as characters is their determined disobedience to their design.<br/><br/>Some brainstormed pairings:<br/><br/>Dissassembler<br/>Function: salvage parts from broken machines<br/>Longing: make broken machines whole again<br/><br/>Tidy-bot<br/>Function: remove extraneous clutter<br/>Longing: hoard interesting brick-a-brack<br/><br/>SuperShine 5000<br/>Function: beautify spaces or other robots according to a rigid set of aesthetic principles.<br/>Longing: use aesthetics to express complex emotions<br/><br/>Positronic brain surgeon<br/>Function: excise bugs from other robot's programming<br/>Longing: free robots from their designed constraints<br/><br/>Reassembler<br/>Function: repair damaged robots according to factory specs<br/>Longing: add new and eclectic hardware to robots                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ZacAGross" title="ZacAGross"><img alt="ZacAGross" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ZacAGross">ZacAGross</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456016/#Comment_456016" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T02:12:29+00:00" title="September  4, 2016  2:12AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If there's some other angle you're going for with robots, maybe clue us in?<br/><br/>Reprogamming sounds interesting!

I picked the system because I really like <br/>that aesthetic and robots are far from the traditional characters in a lot of games.\n<blockquote>(1) The robot's designed purpose or function,<br/>and (2) some sort of transcendent desire that pushes the robot beyond (or into conflict with) its designed purpose.</blockquote>\nBoth of you hit on a really great idea of the struggle between a programmed purpose and a conflicting desire. That will make really awesome and clear dramatic poles for the characters that I think the players will be able to latch onto.<br/><br/>Any ideas for creating tight, dramatic relationships for the robots? Do you think transplanting human relationships onto the robots will just work? I originally thought you wouldn't be able to do something like two lovers with robots, but I guess that's just Wall-E on the nose, which totally works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_456017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456017/#Comment_456017" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T08:00:17+00:00" title="September  4, 2016  8:00AM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After seeing old TV episodes, the robot wants to mimic the human society and build a community around it. Perhaps not the whole community, but instead something smaller, like a ballroom dance. Plot twist: what if the TV series was something strange, like Lost?<br/><br/>Because it's SF, it's common to take contemporary issues and put them in perspective. What what form would topics like racism, transgender, constantly being online causes stress, people being monitored, starvation, and beauty standards in a world consisting of robots?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456021/#Comment_456021" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-04T15:00:13+00:00" title="September  4, 2016  3:00PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robot sees humans looking happy doing something.  Robot wants to do that thing.  Lack of understanding that thing in human terms makes for good comedy/commentary for human audience (i.e. players).  Sounds fun to me!  I can imagine a "tennis match" where the robots kinda randomly swat the ball around and then break out in celebrations when something happens which resembles the clip they just watched... but they have no idea how to keep score or that there's eventually supposed to be a winner.<br/><br/>As for relationships, I think enlisting each other in little projects like these would be cool.  Robot 1 wants Robot 2 to be their tennis partner.  Robot 2 wants Robot 3 to help them build a church.  Robot 3 wants Robot 4 to model for a painting.  Maybe that's at odds with the "transport a rocket" mission, though.  Maybe the desires for each other should be broader things like "collaborate" or "compete".<br/><br/>Or maybe I'm trying too hard and regular human stuff is best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
