I guess you could say I'm a closet game theory guy. I just kind of cull what I need for my home brew and stay quiet.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecently I purchased a copy of Hell For Leather from Cobweb games.  In the name of full disclosure, I had play tested it and given the author my thoughts, and also kept a running e-mail dialog with him during the production. I am however not connected to the game professionally in any way.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst of I have to say the basic HFL game is great, I really enjoy it, I think others should give it a try. I make no bones about it that's the point of the post. The other point is that I would hate anyone to think HFL is only good for quick one offs, or that the  standard setting \u201cframe\u201d is the only way to use the game.<br/>\n<br/>\n During our last session, I had a thought. The game group I play in have a steady fantasy campaign that we have used from Basic Ad&amp;D through Advanced , 3.0 , 3.5 ect. We now use the same setting with our home brew game.<br/>\nHow about we run a game of Hell For leather , in that setting and any character who survives the game (not always easy) can become a recurring NPC is our regular game? This was initially to get our Fantasy game grognard to buy into HFL a bit more.<br/>\nHFL worked well for this. Primarily because you don't need a ton of prep to run the game. Secondly because the characters in HFL have plenty of room to be fleshed out.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat we ended up doing is organic creating characters who ended up tied into the main story arc of our long running game. The players pulled from their setting knowledge and used other known locations and NPC's as stepping off points and plot devices on their own.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe two surviving characters ended up being hired by a thieves guild to track down and eliminate the PC's from the main story. I did not do that as a GM , the players did it, them selves through play. So the whole idea has so much more weight to them then an NPC thieves guild member I pulled out of my note book ever could. In fact I was so impressed with creating the NPC's this way I am thinking about rewriting my character generation, as a rules light quick play version of my full game, so that PC's get generated in play.<br/>\nI just though I would share the experience here, because it really impressed me what a fast fun rules light game like HFL can do if used as tool to enhance player investment rather than as a stand alone one shot game.<br/>\n<br/>\nWell Back to lurking.<br/>\nSorry for the length<br/>\nThank you  for having me.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292979/#Comment_292979" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-11T03:54:36+00:00" title="September 11, 2010  3:54AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Mark,<br/><br/>Thanks for posting your feedback here on Story Games. I was impressed when you first suggested using HfL to add colour to an existing world, but I didn't know how it would work out, or whether or not it would debase the colour of your game world. That is, I wondered whether the freeform nature of HfL would contaminate your other game, maybe introducing elements that you'd be unhappy with later. Of course, I hadn't thought about it properly. On reflection, I'm guessing that a collaborative storytelling group will try (assuming they haven't got serious social issues) to make sure that their contributions are both acceptable <i>and </i>awesome. For a group of gamers used to inhabiting the fiction of a long term campaign, all the players should be fairly aware of the constraints and opportunities of acceptability. This fluency of the game world, coupled with collaboration, will probably tend players to create kosher stories. Dodgy narratives are more likely to be frowned upon and tossed aside, while acceptable narratives are more likely to excite the players and be developed during play.<br/><br/>From your email to me on the subject, I'm totally enthused that this sort of cross-platform story generation is something that I <i>must </i>try out myself in the future. I'd like to see the other games people have used to do the same. I'll start another thread on the subject.<br/><br/>Incidentally, when you said:\n<blockquote>At the end of the day it will make the main game feel more alive because these new NPC were played and have personalities. (Even if they are a bit depraved.)</blockquote>, I got very excited. Specifically, HfL delivered villains into your game world. Hell for Leather does tend to turn ordinary people into savages, and I'm excited that the choice of game (HfL in this case) can have influence over the types of NPCs created. Perhaps, if you hacked HfL to occlude Flaws, or you played a game of Fiasco or something, you would clearly get a very different bunch of characters. Is HfL a villain generator?<br/><br/>(Actually, it's probably just a scumbag generator)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_293345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mark2v" title="mark2v"><img alt="mark2v" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mark2v">mark2v</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/293345/#Comment_293345" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-14T11:56:26+00:00" title="September 14, 2010 11:56AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In our game it generated 2 sever scumbags.. I mean One  character gave his brother to the thieves guild to be tied up on a cross bow target and turned into a pin cushion.<br/>\nbut I digress.<br/>\nI think one thing that helped us along is that our home brew game is very narrative based. The base of it is roll for successes narrate what happens based on the number of successes you rolled. Basically the players roll to steal narrative control from each other  and from the story guide (GM). So we are used to keeping things coherent even if all the player have a ton of narrative freedom. I am not sure I could have used it as easily with say Gurps or D&amp;D 3.5 / pathfinder.. etc...<br/>\n(though i am drooling to try and make a Sorcerer character this way ...
