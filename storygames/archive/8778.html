I'll offer this as an example that hopefully other game designers can take to heart when they set about writing their texts.<br/>\n<br/>\nSummerlands mechanics are fairly straightforward and not at all hard to grasp the mechanical bits.  They don't fill me with glee and have me yearning to grab dice and start playing but they seem functional in that "rules light", "get out of the way" utilitarian kind of way that was big a few years ago.  But there are significant gaps in the instructions for how to apply them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll summarize the rules which start out with basic opposed stake setting which some people really have an issue with but that doesn't bother me:<br/>\n<br/>\n1) player states intent and what his character gets if he wins.  Player will narrate victory<br/>\n2) GM states consequences and what the character suffers if he loses.  GM will narrate failure (or if in conflict with another player the player's will have opposed intents)<br/>\n3) A score is calculated by determining appropriate attributes and tags and help<br/>\n4) GM determines difficulty which is the number of dice to roll trying  to get below the score.<br/>\n5) Player rolls<br/>\n6) Theres some damage type stuff (called distress) that happens on failure in addition to the stakes based on the difference in the rolls.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo here's the crucial parts that are not explicitly stated in the text.<br/>\n1) What is the allowable scale of the stakes?  I've found no text that directly addresses this.  The only place that even touches on it confuses things further by asserting that the entire conflict is resolved by a single roll.  Other parts of the text use fairly routine tasks as examples like "repair the car".  So 1 roll to repair the car and 1 roll to fight another dude are actually stated.  So is that also 1 roll to fight an entire feud between neighboring villages with stakes to destroy the losing village? Is it 1 roll to rebuild the entire village that's destroyed?  Rules as Written the player sets the intent.  So if the player say their intent is to rebuild one building its one building.  If they say the intent is the village its the village.  If they say its the entire world...its the entire world.  Neither the GM nor group consensus is given any explicit input or over ride authority over the player's stated intent.  Rules as Written player states ANYTHING THEY WANT as their intent and there is no authority other than non rules based social pressures to set standards.  There are some game designers that I would interpret the lack of any further process as meaning exactly what is written.  Player sets intent, no one else has any input into the player's choice whatsofuckingever.  I suspect,  based on the horde of indie games I've read and played (often with their designer) that there is actually a whole process that happens at Greg's table to decide stakes that just didn't make it into the rules.  If you mean for us to kibbitz and discuss before the player sets stakes and the GM to have final veto over stakes he doesn't think are appropriate...tell us that.  If you mean for the player to be able to do whatever he wants with no input from any body else and no recourse for anyone who doesn't like it...tell us that.  But for god's sake...tell us SOMETHING.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) The GM sets consequences.  Based on what?  Is the intent for the GM to set consequences that are in balance with the scale of the intent the player established?  Or is the intent for the GM to set consequences that are some degree (perhaps substantially so) harsher than the player's intent in a sort of "even now?" fashion.  Is this meant to be a dramatic dial that the GM can use to control the pacing of the game?  A later part of the rules mentions scripted scenarios as an acceptable way to GM this game...are the consequences meant to be the way the GM keeps things on script?  What...<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Can the player back out?  The GM sets both the price of failure AND the difficulty...specifically setting the difficulty AFTER seeing what the player's target number is.  So  if the intent is X and the consequence is Y and the difficulty is Z can the player say "Whoa, I'm not willing to risk paying Y to get X, especially not with difficulty Z...screw that, I'll do something else".  Rules as Written provide absolutely no provision for the player to back out once the process is started.  It may seem like an "of course players can choose not to roll once they see what's at stake" kind of thing but if that's the case fucking SAY THAT.  I can think of numerous cases where its just as valid (for an "in your face - suck it" kind of game to not allow that.  Which is it?<br/>\n<br/>\n4) What order to player's go in?  This is completely and utterly completely absent.  The conflict rules briefly touch on the idea of PCs being in conflict with each other...one would think then that who  gets to go first would be a rather important thing to know.  Does the GM just decide based on what's reasonable in the fiction and the descriptions of actions the players have given?  Then SAY THAT!  The only thing the rules mention is that there are only ever 2 sides to a conflict, a side consists of 1 character acting and at most 1 character helping, and that if there are more characters involved (in a "dramatically important way") to split the activity into several rolls.  Ok, on what basis, which order are they resolved in, and can the results of the earlier rolls influence the difficulty of the later rolls?  Do all the rolls have to be established and calculated before any of them are resolved or can you just figure out each roll as it comes up? Or what?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194089/#Comment_194089" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T08:52:47+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  8:52AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure...I'm an experienced GM and rules interpreter.  I can come up with "how I'd do it" for each of these things.  But I shouldn't fucking have to.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirstly, there's every likelihood the GM and the game designer come from different cultures of play.  "how I'd do it" might be totally different from how the designer did it.  The cultures may be compatable enough that the game works anyway, or might be so alien that the game totally fucking self destructs as I as GM bring in play paradigms destructive to those the game was designed for.  I can play successfully under a wide variety of play paradigms.  Fucking tell me which one to use to make your game work best.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecondly, I shouldn't fucking  have to.  Every single thing above is basic game design 101 type stuff.  If I've got to figure all that out for myself than I've essentially written half your game for you.  What the fuck did I just spend money on?  If I have to design the game myself anyway, I might as well just design my own damn game.  Or play one that doesn't require me to do the designers job for them.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nI am certain that every single one of the above items has answers when played around Greg's table.  I don't really mind what the answers are...they just should be explicitly stated in the text.  I will also say, that I've read through the book twice and flipped through it mulitple times trying to cross reference and look for answers, but I haven't done my full "I'm going to run this so I'll go over it ad naseum with a fine tooth comb routine".  So its possible that some of the answers to the above are in the text somewhere or implied in the text somewhere.  In which case, convert my rant into "don't imply, state.  And organize the text so I can freaking find the answers when I look them"<br/>\n<br/>\nThe color of this game is fascinating.  Its the color that sold me.  But the incomplete instructions on how to play will prevent me from even trying to run this.  With  so many games out there that I want to play, I really can't be bothered to fill in this many gaps for myself.  What's worse, every time I pay money for a game and wind up with something this incomplete makes me more wary of buying the next game.  I wish IPR lived up to its slogan that "some games are more equal than others" and did a better job of vetting titles before offering them for sale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194091/#Comment_194091" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T09:43:05+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  9:43AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, do you have similar problems with the words "Game Master" or "GM" not appearing in the entire text of <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>?  Because I think this is more than just "game design 101."  It sounds like you want specific things from a roleplaying text and are disappointed when they are not there. But people interact with game texts in different ways, right? Some texts are even intentionally vague to allow play groups to implement their own solutions or standard practices (as in the case of TSOY).<br><br>Even if Summerland is unintentionally vague, so what?  If you don't want to put in the work necessary to play it, don't play it.  I find the work necessary to start playing Burning Empires to be hugely intimidating, so I probably will never run it (though I'm running Mouse Guard right now).  Just because Burning Empires is explicitly, completely clear on the work needed to run it and Summerland is less clear about what is entailed, that does not necessarily make one easier to run than the other. Honestly, with my current play group, we'd be more likely to find success with Summerland.<br><br>To summarize: just because a game isn't written to be accessible to you or supportive of your chosen play style/preferences does not mean it is a bad game or even badly written.  Maybe it's just targeted at a different audience.  I'm not trying to criticize your rant here because I ranted about how Poison'd and In a Wicked Age were broken because I couldn't get them to work for me or the playstyle of the folks I was running them for.  But other folks seem to rock out to them, so there's clearly something else happen there, yeah?<br><br>I have not read or played Summerland but, to me, it sounds like a disconnect between you and the text and the assumptions of the author, not a game in which the play procedures were inadequately described, necessarily.  Is it going to work as an introductory text for people new to roleplaying, probably not, but not every game text has to walk players through everything.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194094/#Comment_194094" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T10:07:49+00:00" title="February 25, 2009 10:07AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its not a play style thing Jonathan.

Even "1 roll can resolve anything larger than clicking one tumbler in a lock, and anything smaller than a battle" is better than nothing.  It also sounds like a lot of your gripes could have been addressed by a play example showing, "Do this in this order," with a few notes on variations.

I agree completely that leaving out the "how" of your rules is unacceptable. People can differ on whether the "why" of the rules or additional strategic considerations must be included (I like seeing both myself), but not fleshing out your core procedures is a real problem, not a play style issue.<br><br>Since I'm allso a board game player, I tend to think of game texts in that manner. It would be unforgiveable for board game rules to leave out parts of the game you need to play. Describing how your game's system works (IIEE, stakes negotiation, etc.) is just as fundamental to our designs as the rules of a board game.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194114/#Comment_194114" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T10:47:41+00:00" title="February 25, 2009 10:47AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, Ralph, are you as angry about this as you sound in your post?  Just curious.<br><br>I broadly agree, though.  Too many game texts seem to leave many assumptions unstated, and I think most games (I'm tempted to say "all" but this may not be correct) would benefit from being very clear and very specific about everything that the game designer thinks should be happening at the table.  Maybe I agree with those procedures, maybe I don't, but I really hate it when I try out a game and I have a problem with and then, when I go asking around on the intarwebs to find out way, I'm told "Well, you should have done X, and not done Y" when neither of those rules/procedures/assumptions is made explicit in the text.<br><br>I will say I don't think it's necessarily bad <i>design</i>, however.  I think what it is is a failure to communicate the design in a clear and explicit manner.  Ideally, I think it would be a good idea if, near the end of the game design/text writing process someone who had never played the game or read any earlier version of the text sat down with the group and wrote down every single thing that they did throughout a session.  Realistically, this will probably never happen, but I think it's a good mindset to have.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194121/#Comment_194121" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T10:59:02+00:00" title="February 25, 2009 10:59AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, I still think is almost completely subjective, but I'm not sure what else I can say.

Sure...entirely different art forms but still skills that are translatable.<br/>\n<br/>\nBrian...angry?  Maybe.  I'd probably characterize it as aggressively disappointed, but that's perhaps slicing things too thin.  The book came out in 2008.  We should know better by now.

And that's Ass.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're going to design games that require a shared understanding generated through years of talking and playing together in order to play effectively, then don't publish them.  Play them at home with your group and share them with friends who share that understanding with you.  Don't make them available to a broader audience not familiar with your "shared understanding", don't distribute them through a public store front, and sure as hell don't charge money for them.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Question: At the start of a ship fight, which of these ranges do you use?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnswer: It depends on the narrative. Did you start by saying "We pursue that ship"? Then it's pursuit. Did you say "We lie in wait, then come out of the cove and engage them?". It's probably Broadside to Broadside.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nPerfectly fine answer.  One that should be in the text.  What I like about what Vincent's doing with Apocalypse World is that he's making a strong effort to figure out HOW to say that in the text.  I've got no problem with AW being essentially illusionist freeform and being particularly explicit about that and how to do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet me dismiss the unstated strawman right now.  I'm not advocating a certain type of answer.  I'm not advocating a rigid unbreakable process with a limited subset of options to choose from.  Just fill in the blanks with something.  In Universalis how many Coins you spend to accomplish something depends on how narrowly or broadly you define a "fact".  I don't tell you how to do it in the game.  I don't try and force you to define facts my way.  But I do point out explicitly that this is a dial that will have a major impact on how the game flows and point out other rules that can also be tweaked  depending on how your group rolls.  What I don't do is just leave it up in the air and rely on some "shared understanding" BS to resolve it.  If you want your players to figure it out for themselves.  Then frickin' tell them "this part here you'll need to figure out for yourselves".   Even better is if you can provide some guidelines on which to base their decision.<br/>\n<br/>\nSilence is not a helpful answer.<br/>\nAnarchy is not an effective system<br/>\nand relying solely on the virtue of other players to make a game work will not make the game experience transferable to other play groups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194164/#Comment_194164" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T12:56:10+00:00" title="February 25, 2009 12:56PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><cite><br><br>1) How do you determine which character (or theme) the next scene is about in D&amp;D?<br>2) How do you ensure niche-protection in Dogs in the Vineyard, so you don't have a bunch of talky characters but nobody who can shoot?<br>3) How do you determine how old your character is in Primetime Adventures?<br><br>Clearly there must be a rule for those, right?

But you may fill them across the "Shared Understanding" when that is not what the author meant.<br/><br/>Or, we each have a slightly different understanding of stake-setting and such things, and so, each group will understand the game differently, which may be fine, but it leads to non-transferable knowledge of the game.

The players were like: "Okay, we're going to seize that other ship."  And I was like "Great! Let's go to the dice and play out the conflict!"  But playing out the conflict through the dice ended up being not compelling at all (plus there was, as Graham said, confusion about how to even begin a ship-to-ship battle).  I don't even remember if the characters won or lost and we stopped playing shortly after that initial conflict.  Nobody really cared about anything that was happening because I was assuming that the mechanics would enliven the bleak fiction rather than the other way around.<br/><br/>Months and months later, I had an email conversation with Vincent where he explained that in his "leading with the fiction" games, he intended players to engage the mechanics as if they're (his example) drifting Shadowrun, which is to say, reluctantly and at the last possible moment, when everything else has been already established through narration.  This finally clicked for me, since that's the way I played Rifts for years growing up.  However, none of Vincent's previous explanations had worked for me at all.  In the meantime, I'd also had a game of In a Wicked Age totally blow up in my face, for exactly the same reason.  Thing is, and this is what leads me to doubt Ralph's thesis, <i>I have no idea what Vincent could have said or written in the text to get me to understand how to play these games.</i> Now, I read both Poison'd and IAWA and I see the places where Vincent is trying to tell you how to approach them, but those didn't mean anything to me before.  I really would have had to watch other people play successfully or play the games with folks who'd played with Vincent, I think.  That would have been the most expedient.<br/><br/>Consequently, I really, truly believe that there are fundamental things about play that are really, really difficult (even impossible) to communicate through a text, especially if you don't share the same core assumptions and play style of the author.  Likewise, as I said above, the issue of what stuff is even worth explaining at all is a big deal.  Vincent said, at one point, that I wasn't the target audience for Poison'd and IAWA, meaning that the text doesn't share my assumptions about play; it makes other assumptions about play and then only explains the aspects of play that its audience needs in order to make the game work for them.  That's a big, big deal.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>If you're going to design games that require a shared understanding generated through years of talking and playing together in order to play effectively, then don't publish them.  Play them at home with your group and share them with friends who share that understanding with you.  Don't make them available to a broader audience not familiar with your "shared understanding", don't distribute them through a public store front, and sure as hell don't charge money for them.</blockquote>\nI guess the entirety of indie game publishing will be composed of 4-5 games, at most. Is less publishing really the answer? Does that make for a more diverse and vibrant community? I doubt it. Honestly, I think what's happening is that indie game publishing has grown so diverse that most games are not written for the same core audience, but for a diversity of different audiences who have different play preferences and base assumptions about play.  Certainly, this means you have to be more careful about purchases. You can't just pick up any indie game now and assume that it's compatible with your background. Reading AP and talking with folks who have played it and even playing games before purchasing them are all great ideas.  Otherwise, it's like randomly picking a movie to rent that looks good; odds are, you might not like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194177/#Comment_194177" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T13:33:10+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  1:33PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2009 1:33PM by fnord3125.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>How do you know when there<i>must be a rule</i>and when the game<i>clearly means you should decide on your own</i>or even when<i>it doesn't really matter</i>?</blockquote>Generally I decide whether something matters based on its mechanical significance.  If something is important, I would expect that importance to be reflected in the rules of the game in some fashion.  Then, given that something is important, I expect there to be a rule of some kind for dealing with it.  If that rule is "GM decides" or "Decide through group consensus" that's fine, but the text needs to say that.  If there is no rule at all, but the mechanics/system of the game make it clear that something matters, I'll be left scratching my head and flipping through the book looking for that rule that I know "must exist somewhere."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194179/#Comment_194179" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T13:35:15+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  1:35PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you understood Ralph differently Jonathan, regarding that last paragraph.<br/><br/>He's not adovcating not releasing games, he's advocating releasing games where you can put in writing what you mean, and not rely on something amorphous that can't be relied on, which you can't put your weight on without worrying that the it won't hold you, support you.<br/>Your game should be able to support the kind of play you intend it to support; sure, it won't fit everyone, nor should it.

I should have said "Bad Design Communication" rather than "Bad Design".<br/><br/>Further comments:  <br/><br/>I don't consider the fact that it is impossible to fill every gap a valid excuse for not filling the ones you can.<br/><br/>I don't buy the idea that these ideas are too complicated to communicate effectively in text.  With sufficient motivation I could rewrite the 5 or 6 pages of conflict rules in Summerland to clearly and succinctly address every issue I raised above in a couple of hours.  With maybe a 40 minute phone call with Greg I could probably do so in a way that matches his intended play style.  Thinking this hobby of ours is somehow too difficult to explain to non insiders is gamer fallacy hubris at its best.   <br/><br/>I also don't accept the notion that we'd only have 4-5 published games.  If we as a community put as much time and effort into rewarding and congratulating each other on the effectiveness of our texts as we do rewarding and congratulating each other for clever concepts and mechanical innovations I think we'd have mastered the art of rules writing long before now.  Instead we've inculcated a culture that rewards the new but doesn't hold designers accountable for the quality of their communication.  We have not developed a tradition of effective technical writing or meaningful textual critique in the way we have for design and play theory.  That's a failing of the community, not evidence that such things are impossible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194192/#Comment_194192" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T14:06:03+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  2:06PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread is moving a bit quickly to keep up with.<br/><br/>Guy:  Yes, exactly.<br/><br/>Judd, Rob:  Thanks.

I don't agree.  I think this kind of critique is bad for us.  Ralph coming in and saying "fuck" a whole lot when offering a negative and unsupportive review of a game by a first-time designer/publisher that's clearly written with different play assumptions in mind does not make the community better.

He intends it (tell me if I mis-represent you Ralph) to be constructive to people who still had not published their games. Be they as far from his play-style as they may be. He's pointing at form, not the content of the rules, but the way they are written, or not.<br/><br/>Edit: I am not going to pass judgment or say what I think of it, but I heard in various places about the role of shame in keeping morality. People don't do things because they don't want the shame/scorn. People like to talk about how people should do [X] because they truly feel it/believe in it, and not because they don't want to be talked badly about. But in our real world, that's a main reason for having "Social order" and people not walking around groping others.<br/><br/>Edit 2: And perhaps yes, it should stop being called a thread about Summerland, it may not have begun exactly as one, it's certainly not about it now.

Gaps in published games is a real issue, and a little heated criticism, with its potential impact on sales and social standing, could indeed prompt people to take more care with their products, which would be a good thing for this community.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_194229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194229/#Comment_194229" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T16:15:59+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  4:15PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.<br/><br/>This is why you should always have your games edited by a non-gamer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194233/#Comment_194233" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T16:36:35+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  4:36PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 25, 2009 4:40PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edited: not worth it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194236/#Comment_194236" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-25T16:49:27+00:00" title="February 25, 2009  4:49PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Could you split threads off?

Everyone's situated. Designers who don't usually work with editors will defend texts that editor-experienced designers will find unclear or incomplete. <br/><br/>It's no secret that I, personally, think that nearly every single indie game out there would have benefited hugely from external editing - from an editor outside the designer's community. I think publishing a game that hasn't been properly edited shows a lack of respect for, or understanding of, one's craft. <br/><br/>Some dude: "Yeah, I made this painting. Yeah, I know, the orc's got one leg that's longer than the other, but it's okay, most people can see it's an orc just fine. Wanna buy it?"<br/>Me: "I'll buy it, because I love orcs, and there are only fifty people in the world drawing orcs.

I actually felt a tad shocked by all the f-bombs going off left right and centre, which in my mind I think detracted from the argument a little. I'm pretty sure they could all be removed and the point of the comment would be the same. If you want new guys to come here and contribute, I'd consider taking a little time to consider how those comments come across on someone computer screen. If you're not bothered, fire away.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway... I guess you're right Vladimir - there are sections of Summerland which don't explicitly state how those consequences, difficulities and intents and created. The idea is that the player can state any intent they like, it's then up to the GM to assigm a difficulty, leaving the player to decide if they want to accept the difficulty and the consequence the GM relates. You want to shoot a stationary deer in front of you. Easy, if you muck it up the deer will run. You want to take out ten hostile guys hidden in the woods with your toothpick? Impossible, and if you fail they're going to give you a kicking. The idea is that there is a narrative to and fro between the player and the GM, with the player assessing the level of risk (i.e. risk of failure) he is willing to accept to do what he wants to do, knowing what the GM hsa instore for him if he fails. Is that explicitly stated in the text? I guess not, so my bad. In fact, maybe adding that sentence alone would help a lot so cheers for getting me thinking! <br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, I think writing perfect rpg rules is a difficult task. Boardgames are relatively simply - limited set of actions, clearly defined results. Wargames are a bit more tricky - more options and more freedom of actions, but again hopefully clearly defined results. In rpgs there are loads of options, the opportunity for open-ended and unrestricted play, and therefore many possible results. As a writer, I can try to define those results are much as possible, but it is difficult without the text becoming very long-winded and boring to read. It's a tough path to walk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAyway, you guys are chewing the fat here fine without me. Sorry the game wasn't to your liking Vladimir, I hope you make soem use of the setting. Horses for courses I guess.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Doctor" title="Evil Doctor"><img alt="Evil Doctor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evil%20Doctor">Evil Doctor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194293/#Comment_194293" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T02:30:43+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  2:30AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2009 3:57AM by Evil Doctor.">edited February 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn - I guess I should read what I type!

The rules can be consisely written because of this, there's very little subjectivity. For example, in Agricola, I can use an action to feed my farmers (if you've played that game, it makes sense), and I can do that in a small set of allowable ways. I can't gather my farmers and go on holiday to brazil, that's not allowed in the rules. In an rpg about farming, I could state that my character and his farmer friends were going to set off for brazil, and the GM would need to accept that and work it into what's happening. Rpgs are generally open in their possible actions, whereas boardgames are very restricted and closed. Anyway, that's by the by.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease note everyone that I haven't taken any offense, I have a thick skin ;-) I just think there are others who might view this thread from the top and think 'that game must be rubbish' and then 'whoa, I'm not going there!', before they get too much further down...<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194299/#Comment_194299" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T03:47:48+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  3:47AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph is all for procedural games/texts, where it is more akin to board-game rules written than most RPGs I know.

Can I build star destroying device with one stake or is that not what this game is about? I'm not expecting strict guidelines because I don't think the rules should mulitply unnecessarily but there is often, with Indie games in particular, a hole where the intent and scope of the game should be given. And also where the authority to decide what is acceptable lies.<br/><br/>I'm quite happy for everthing to ramp up, as it did in our game of Solar System, if it fits the narrative.<br/><br/>Trad games tend to have rules that cover every eventuality, and don't have stakes per se, so intent is usually driven out from the rules. In games with a much wider scope in character action or player statement, it's harder to understand.<br/><br/>Vincent's recent games are a bit weird in this respect because they have quite a lot of rules but much of the balancing of rules happens inside Vincent's head and it's difficult for us mere mortals to attain the understanding without playing with Vincent. To me they look like the stuff that his group needs to think about because the rest of it they do anyway.

It's a fairly low-powered setting focusing on 'normal' people in a slightly twisted version of our world - that sets the levels that are appropriate for the stakes and what is achievable in the setting. Not to say that I shouldn't have made that absolutely and adundantly clear in the text.

How big a chunk of story can I manipulate?<br/><br/>Could I have stakes of 'Bringing the kids safely across the mountain'? It's just a mountain. Ordinary people cross mountains. It could be an aside, where the meat of the story is elsewhere. Or could be the focus of an entire session, and thus might work better with a series of rolls - findign resources, maintaining morale, a key moment in the climb at night, etc.<br/><br/>In Fate, for example, that could be one roll or broken down into a series <i>if</i> the players were interested in breaking it down.

I would say lit comes down to the desires of the group and the GM as expressed when the game was set up, but it's not something I address directly in the text. I would argue though that it doesn't make the game unplayable in any way, it just assumes that that stake level will be explicitly or implicitly set by the players and the GM as part of their game. The way the rules are set out there's nothing to stop the players and GM using one roll, or splitting it into lots of different parts of a story. That's up to those playing - is it seen as a major part of the story, or as flavour/colour? Is it a conflict at all? That's for the GM and players to decide. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't see this as any different to most other games though - in most games I've played you could divide a scene or action into many subparts if you wanted. For example, in a lot of fantasy adventures, travelling is glossed over in this way without it being explicitly written that it has to be so. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheers,<br/>\n<br/>\nGreg                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194356/#Comment_194356" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T07:40:47+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  7:40AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've nearly posted this in the other thread, whew.<br/><br/>Jonathan, I have a question to you, let me quote something you've said <a href="http://adamdray.livejournal.com/238114.html?thread=1079074#t1079074" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>:\n<blockquote>I think he's still in the world where designers are clearly distinct from players and should be treated differently. Like, when he talks about tables being full of designers, what does that mean exactly?</blockquote>\nI have the impression, that to you, a game text is almost never used as is. For you, all players are not potential designers, but de-facto designers, and when they get a game, you trust them to take it and make it their own; changing things so that they will be what they want them to be, perhaps not even playing a full session with the rules as written.<br/><br/>And if so, it's not surprising that gaps and holes do not bother you, because for you, the act of playing is mingled with the art of design as is, and it's <i>expected</i> that the players will design, based on the original scaffolding. I think it's important to remember, if we make all these calls to people who come from seperate fields, like improv, or even more importantly, board-gamers, where they do not have experience with changing formal rules, or are much more used to following the rules as are, that this assumption breaks apart.<br/><br/>Furthermore, even if I could design a game in my sleep, who said I'm in the mood now? And especially in the midst of a session? And of course, if I am going to play all games based on the model in my head, which is apparently public and shared, why buy games at all? If I only need the colour, then I'll read about the game. If I want the mechanics, if I buy a game with mechanics, then I expect them all to be in, because this is another issue I talked to a friend about yesterday:<br/>It seems people are buying games partially for the plug-and-play-able parts. You want to see what bits and pieces you can take for your design, and as such, it doesn't matter if there's not a full game there, you'd just plug that piece into your Model. But if I try to play a game, I try to play the game I bought.<br/><br/>Want to sell me plug-and-play?

I guess you're right Vladimir - there are sections of Summerland which don't explicitly state how those consequences, difficulities and intents and created. The idea is that the player can state any intent they like, it's then up to the GM to assigm a difficulty, leaving the player to decide if they want to accept the difficulty and the consequence the GM relates. You want to shoot a stationary deer in front of you. Easy, if you muck it up the deer will run. You want to take out ten hostile guys hidden in the woods with your toothpick? Impossible, and if you fail they're going to give you a kicking. The idea is that there is a narrative to and fro between the player and the GM, with the player assessing the level of risk (i.e. risk of failure) he is willing to accept to do what he wants to do, knowing what the GM hsa instore for him if he fails. Is that explicitly stated in the text? I guess not, so my bad. In fact, maybe adding that sentence alone would help a lot so cheers for getting me thinking!"</blockquote>\nHey Greg, sorry you happened to be the example I used to demonstrate my point.  You just happened to be the game I had just finished reading after picking it up at Dreamation.<br/><br/>But yes, what you just wrote is perfectl'y fine for filling in some of those gaps I outlined.  It doesn't have to be big elaborate 50 pages of rules.  Just knowing that the player can back off after hearing the consequences is a big deal and completely changes  the feel of the game.  A GM playing the game for the first time and not finding any place where the rules say they can decide not to proceed after they've declared an action and calculated their score may well rule at their table "no you can't".  And that would be a perfectly reasonable ruling given the text.  But the game would be collosally different from the one you play.<br/><br/>Games with holes can be played.  They just require the play group to fill those holes in order to proceed.  If they fill those holes with assumptions radically different from what you fill them with when you play, then they'll get radically different outcomes and experiences from what you get.  Actually noticing all of the tricks and techniques you use at your table without thinking about them and making sure that those make it into the text is one of the hardest, but most essential, parts of game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194365/#Comment_194365" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T07:57:33+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  7:57AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or text-writing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_194366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DevP" title="DevP"><img alt="DevP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/818/nB2L0MAZS1OU2.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DevP">DevP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194366/#Comment_194366" name="Item_66" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T08:01:23+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  8:01AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>The idea is that the player can state any intent they like, it's then up to the GM to assigm a difficulty, leaving the player to decide if they want to accept the difficulty and the consequence the GM relates.</blockquote>\nAnd this is the assumption that many players would plug in - they simply would not see the gaping hole that many SG-folks would see. Different experiences &amp; gameplay =&gt; different understandings of what makes a complete text. Of course, going for more clarity is always good, but I think there's an unfortunate extent that, beyond defining a very constrained game, there is not "complete" definition of a game that you can have.<br/><br/>I'll assert that, unfortunately, game texts that assert Every Single Detail are tedious to read, for me at least. I can appreciate getting the gist of the game that uses the known shorthand and understanding of a community ("we set stakes on your hard choices to trigger your endgame timer"). Of course on the downside this is exceedingly non-accessible and there are tradeoffs everywhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_194367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/194367/#Comment_194367" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-26T08:02:05+00:00" title="February 26, 2009  8:02AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Guy, I think this is one of those things were we're all participating in different hobbies that are all called "roleplaying."

Personally, I'd like to see more of those kinds of game reviews. This thread is more of a rant/strong critique about All Games, using Summerland as a jumping off point to make points.<br/><br/>In the end, if you want a brutal critique of your game, here's my suggested workflow:<br/>1) Post a copy of your game to First Thoughts or Connections (prob the latter) over at The Forge.<br/>2) Post on your blog that you're looking for criticism.<br/>3) Post here either in its own thread (in "Game Design Help", or append a message on the end of the Cool Stuff of the Month threads) asking people to read/critique/drop bombs.<br/><br/>That's the best thing to do, probably. Playing a game, followed by a face to face "So what did you *think*?" will probably not be as deep as what you can get if you want feedback for your game in comparison to the above method.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8778/summerland-writing-game-text-tell-us-what-you-mean" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8778/summerland-writing-game-text-tell-us-what-you-mean" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8778/summerland-writing-game-text-tell-us-what-you-mean/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8778%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8778%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
