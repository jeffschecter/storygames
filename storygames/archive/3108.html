If it's too long, or if it doesn't belong here, I'm sorry!</i></small><br/><br/>So, I went to the Ides of Gaming event held locally here in Tucson. This is a monthly gaming day, from noon to six on the Saturday afternoon nearest to the 15th.<br/><br/>I didn't know a soul. Well, okay, I knew a few people virtually, from the RTEAM mailing list and from Story-Games.com, but I'd never met anyone in person, and here I was, preparing to demonstrate Bone White, Blood Red for the first time ever.<br/><br/>To say I was nervous would be an understatement of British proportions. I'd posted on SG to ask for advice, and other friends reassured me via AIM on my Treo cell phone. It'd be okay. Right?<br/><br/>I looked around and most everyone had gotten involved with a board game of Viking raiding ships. I met Thomas, who was one of those SG fellows I "knew" already. In addition to being one of the Ides organizers, he also specifically said he wanted to get in on the demo of my game, which was nice. But a demo with just one player didn't make a whole lot of sense, so I waited for more people to arrive while looking around.<br/><br/><img alt="[BWBR with basket]" src="http://kynn.com/games/bwbr/bwbr-basket-023c.jpg"/><br/><br/>Sitting there with a basket, several cords, and a pile of beads, I stopped to reflect on what drew the gamers (who were mostly boardgamers) to a game. I realized that while my impulse to avoid "paper artifacts" was a good one in theory, there was little to actually say what the game was, and how people could play it. I resolved to solve this before next time I gave a public demo.<br/><br/>Matt, a friend of Thomas and a fellow roleplayer (albeit one who had taken a break from the hobby for years before getting back into it recently), soon joined us at the table, and I decided to start. I'm told that this Ides was particularly low in attendance compared to the previous months, due to summer.<br/><br/>First, I handed out leather cords to each of them. Matt grabbed the black one; Thomas wanted the black one too, but took a brown cord.<br/><br/>Then I started in with a big long lengthy monologue, which was clearly a mistake. But it was the first time I'd ever tried to explain the game talking out loud (rather than in written text online or just by linking to the PDF URL), and I figured I was gonna fail anyway at explaining, so I might as well try so I know what not to do next time.<br/><br/>They weren't bored, per se, but it wasn't the best way to explain the situation and get started on playing. As both Thomas and Matt would later agree, some sort of background handout, preferably with illustrations, would help a lot. It's one thing to try to describe Pueblo people, and another thing to be able to VISUALIZE what kind of person you are by seeing a picture of those people in their own environment, clothing, and so on.<br/><br/>Neither of them had heard of the Pueblo Revolt, but that's okay -- the game doesn't really hinge on knowing the details of it other than what needs to be explained in an explainer "cheat sheat." (The approach of BWBR is to not necessarily gloss over details, but to universalize the experience of revolt against injustice.) Thomas raised the possibility of insulting cultural stereotyping, since most people only know Native Americans via movies, and I agree that's a concern that needs to be addressed.<br/><br/>Then I separated out a small handful of each color of beads from the main pile, and explained what Bone White, Blood Red, Sky Blue, Turquoise, Gold Coin, and Silver Steel all mean. They caught on, mostly, but the huge lists of what each COULD stand for seemed overwhelming at first. Eventually they understood, but Matt's suggestion was that each color have three associated words, and these could be printed on something for player reference. Good idea!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70973/#Comment_70973" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T00:30:55+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 12:30AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Character Creation, Take One, and Rules Explanation</b><br/><br/>We went around in a circle, starting with Thomas, to create characters. Coming up with names for characters was tricky; I need to supply a list of sample names, or a random generator, or something. Thomas named his character "Eagle Shadow," while Matt's was "Gray Dove" -- both good names. I needed to write these down, or I'd forget (ADD strikes!), violating right there my "no paper artifacts" rule. Well, it was good in theory.<br/><br/>Each player threaded one bead at a time, telling what they represented and then we went on to the next person. This approach worked well, I thought, and gave the result that I wanted: the other players feel as if they were in on the building of a character from the beginning, and in fact, they could build their character in reaction to the other's. When it came to my turn, as Spider Grandmother, I threaded a bead on the Story Cord.<br/><br/>This is a rules change from the version of the PDF submitted to Game Chef -- Spider Grandmother's Cord and the Story Cord are now one-and-the-same. The Story Cord is built up interactively just as the player characters' cords are, during the creation part of the game.<br/><br/>The first four beads for players represent what each character holds sacred; these define the core of the person. On the Story Cord, the first four beads represented the setting. (This would change in the next iteration, see below.) After this, a knot was tied off, and then players chose their Anathema Beads, threading them on the other end of the cords.<br/><br/>Then the next four beads were Ephemeral, and represent factors or influences at work in the character presently. At the same time, Spider Grandmother threaded beads for the theme of the story, saying "This story is about..." (See below, again.)<br/><br/>I think as my second or third Theme bead, I picked up a Blood Red bead and, threading it, said "This story will be about ... ANGER." And the other two guys at the table both went "Ooo..." softly, and Thomas later said that he deliberately picked a Silver Steel bead (representing a gun) as his next Ephemeral bead because of that.<br/><br/>Eagle Shadow turned out to be a guy was in love with a Spanish woman as his fatal flaw, and Gray Dove was a spirit-talking woman who helped ease the dying into their new states of existence. Neat to watch them develop through the bead-stringing and the creativity of the players involved.<br/><br/>Once the players each had 4 Ephemeral beads and the Story Cord had 4 theme beads, I threaded one bead saying something like, "There will be a conflict related to Silver Steel." Then I handed the Story Cord to Thomas, who chose another color of bead. Then Matt, then back to me for a final one. These are Conflict Beads, and define what kind of conflicts would be important in the game.<br/><br/>I also threaded up an NPC cord, representing Esmeralda, the Spaniard who was Eagle Shadow's love interest.<br/><br/>Next, I explained how conflicts are resolved. This is also a change from the Game Chef version, as it doesn't use dice. Equal numbers of beads (8 each, I think) of each color, and the same shape, were in the woven basket in front of me. Conflict resolution works like this:<br/><br/>1. One person is the conflict initiator. She chooses which bead color to use to start the conflict, and describes what she's hoping to do.<br/>2. The other person is the respondent, and she can respond with either the same bead color as the initiator, or the color of her outermost (ephemeral) bead.<br/>3. The respondent reaches into the basket and draws out (without looking at them) four beads.<br/>4. The initiator draws out four beads as well.<br/>5. Both participants reveal their drawn simultaneously. <br/>6. Each adds up the beads of her chosen color on her own cord, plus any in her hand that she's drawn. For example, two red beads on the cord plus one in the draw equals three red beads.<br/>7. Whoever has the most beads is victorious in the conflict. The loser removes her outermost ephemeral bead, and hands it to the victor.<br/>8. If the victor can thread the bead, she may; if she can't (because of the rules on threading beads, as per the PDF version), she discards it into the pile of beads.<br/>9. The loser of a conflict then gains narrative rights and narrates the story of the conflict: she has to take into account the two colors of beads used, the goals of each character in the conflict with the victor's goal being successful, and the result as determined by which bead was removed.<br/>10. In case of a tie, neither side wins, it's a "push" with neither side being successful, and the respondent narrates the outcome.<br/><br/>This worked pretty well in my example, which was Esmeralda repeatedly shooting Gray Dove in the face, or pushing her off a cliff, or something. Fortunately, Matt didn't seem to mind.<br/><br/>Once I'd explained the mechanics, we talked about the rules some. I offered some alternate "bead pulling" mechanics, but ultimately they were just too confusing and not elegant enough to bother with. We also talked about what could happen if you were "killed" by losing your Anathema bead after all your Ephermal beads, and ongoing presence as a spirit. To be honest, while that idea seemed real cool in theory, in practice it sounded too much like either a Friendly Ghost or Obi-Wan Kenobi, and I probably should rethink the idea.<br/><br/>However, as the playtesters pointed out, it would be just as bad to have the game come to a halt while a player is rapidly stringing beads trying to get caught up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70974/#Comment_70974" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T00:31:22+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 12:31AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Character Creation, Take Two</b><br/><br/>We took a break for just a little while, and then made up new characters. Well, Matt kept the name Gray Dove, but remade her conceptually from scratch; that's fine.<br/><br/>Gray Dove was a farmer woman, who respected both the spirits and the Christian god, but was primarily concerned with her community duties of raising crops, while Morning Song, Thomas's character, was the daughter of the chief (who we later renamed the Mayor, to de-exoticfy him a little) and a passionate anti-Catholic revolutionary.<br/><br/>This time, while the players were threading their character cords, SGM (that's me) was threading the Story Cord not with locations, but with themes. Settings came with the Ephemeral beads. So the story cord consisted of four beads of Theme, four beads of Setting, and then one SGM-chosen Conflict bead, two player-chosen Conflict beads, and a final SGM Conflict bead.<br/><br/>The effect of putting Theme first before Setting worked a lot better, especially as players were able to use that information -- as to what the story would be about, rather than WHERE -- to tailor their own bead threadings. And of course, as a sneaky SGM, I was also able to choose which beads I'd thread based on their previous choices. <br/><br/>I still have the last Story Cord in front of me; the Theme beads are Turquoise (community, family), Gold Coin (greed, the church), Silver Steel (technology, weapons), and Gold Coin, while the Setting beads were Sky Blue (nature, outdoors), Turquoise, Gold Coin, and Bone White (spirits, ancestors). We also threaded Conflict beads as before, although I don't remember those. (One thing I learned about playtests is "take better notes!" as well as "maybe get someone else to run it, so you can take notes!")<br/><br/>Eventually I stumbled onto what was actually obvious from the way I set things up: The Setting beads should represent the ONLY places, in this story, that action takes place. Those places turned out to be: Gray Dove's farming land on top of a mesa (Sky Blue), the main community courtyard/plaza of the Pueblo (Turquoise), the church (Gold), and the kiva, where the spirits speak (Bone White).<br/><br/>Defining the Theme beads, I'd said that this story is about the church sending a new priest to the town, to replace the old priest who had died. I named the town Rose Trail (I think... Bead Water was the town in the previous iteration of creation).<br/><br/>Once the Conflict beads were threaded up, the game was ready to start.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70975/#Comment_70975" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T00:31:46+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 12:31AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Actual Play, at last!</b><br/><br/>Actual play began with Gray Dove, cultivating crops on the mesatop, spotting the arrival of the new priest, Father Jose. The chief called everyone in the village to come welcome him at the church. This led to the first conflict.<br/><br/>Morning Song just didn't want to go to the church; Gold is her Anathema bead color, and she disliked the way her father kissed up to the priests, especially after the Spanish had killed her mother. So Thomas initiated a conflict.<br/><br/>At this point, I could have threaded up a cord for her father, The Mayor -- but instead I just decided to use the Story Cord for everything. Which is another change in the rules from the GC 07 version.<br/><br/>In this version of BWBR, the Story Cord represents the forces of opposition to the characters, and Spider Grandmother may choose to use the Story Cord instead of a separate NPC cord. <br/><br/>The example I gave, based on a conversation with my wife, Liz, was of stealing a cannonball: If it's been defined as necessary to the plot to get a cannonball, then SGM can use the Story Cord's beads to represent the difficulty in getting a cannonball, rather than setting an arbitrary value (as in the Game Chef version) based on her judgment of how hard it would be. If there were someone guarding the cannonball, SGM could use that person's NPC cord instead. If it wasn't important to the plot at all, then there's no conflict to resolve, no beads exchanged, and it just happens -- "congrats, you now have a cannonball."<br/><br/>However, in actual play I found that making up NPC cords was not only going to be a time-waster, but it was also completely unnecessary. The Story Cord itself worked just for EVERY CONFLICT that resulted in the game.<br/><br/>The Story Cord retained the use as a game "timer" that Spider Grandmother's cord holds in the PDF version -- when the Story Cord loses all its Conflict beads (akin to Ephemeral beads on player cords), it's time to wrap up the game. (I do allow a caveat that if you want the game to keep going, you could use the Setting beads instead, which has the neat effect that everyone is forced into the same location for the big finish as the game winds down!)<br/><br/>So, back to the actual play -- Morning Song vs. The Mayor. MS is using her passion, her anger, her strong feelings (Blood Red beads) to try to sway her father. Looking at the Story Cord, he could respond with either the single Blood Red bead (matching her color), or with the outermost bead on the Story Cord, which was Gold, a Conflict bead. There were 3 other Gold beads on the Story Cord, so that was chosen.<br/><br/>It became "fact" there, then, that the Mayor himself was a Christian convert, and apparently strongly so, as he had four beads to MS's three red beads. We drew from the basket, but the Mayor won, which means: (a) Morning Song lost her outermost Ephemeral bead, which was a Silver Steel bead, (b) Morning Song was forced to concede to going to the church, and (c) Thomas (playing Morning Star) got to narrate the scene in which this happened.<br/><br/>Thomas voiced both Morning Song, pleading with her anger and pouring out her heart, and her father, resolutely determined to get her into church and basically bullying her into it. In the process, he smashes her loom (a technological item, of sorts; not what I'd choose, but I'm not narrating now, just kibitzing as SGM!), representing the loss of the Silver bead, and they go to the church.<br/><br/>The Story Cord really shouldn't accumulate lost beads from the players -- or else the story never ends -- so the lost Silver bead was simply thrown back in the pile, instead of being threaded.<br/><br/>Next, I wanted to introduce a conflict with Gray Dove, but I was drawing a blank. One of the players -- and I am sorry to say I have forgotten who! -- suggested that the newly arrived priest wanted GD's land for some reason. Perfect! We played out a scene in which the Father was asking for the land to build an observatory (he even brought star maps from Rome!), and the Mayor, who was turning into more and more of a jerk as the game went along, was willing to give it to him. Fearing loss to the community of a quarter of their crops, GD initiated a conflict against the Mayor to persuade him to change his mind, but it wasn't successful, and she also lost a bead. <br/><br/>Morning Song went out to get the people riled up against the priest, spitfire revolutionary that she is, and Gray Dove decided to go see the Priest and try to convince him to choose some other location for the observatory. The Priest, however, wasn't a particularly nice guy, and decided to instead take advantage of the woman who'd come into his new quarters. He (meaning me, SGM) initiated a conflict against GD, which ended in a push -- Matt (GD's player) was then asked to describe the scene in which neither really gets what they want. GD runs out of the priest's room, shirt torn, into the plaza.<br/><br/>The Priest follows and when she accuses him of rape, he accuses her of witchcraft and trying to seduce him. Morning Song tries to rally the people on Gray Dove's side, saying "she's provided food for our village for thirty years!" Suddenly, Gray Dove became a lot older than any of us had known, but that's all fun, right? The resulting conflict is another push, leaving the village generally confused about what to do. In the course of the conflict, the Mayor reveals that Gray Dove had made a pass at him years before, so she's now got a somewhat scandalous reputation as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70976/#Comment_70976" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T00:35:54+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 12:35AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NOTE: At this point I may have gotten a little muddled as to the order of what happened. Feel free to correct me, Thomas or Matt, if the sequence is out of order.<br/><br/>The Mayor orders everyone to back off, and Morning Song goes to speak to her betrothed, who we named Eagle Shadow in the interest of recycling names. He insists to her that her father has to be killed when the revolution comes, because he sides with the Christian priest. MS, conflicted, disagrees, and the argument results in a conflict with each trying to convince the other. It ends with another push, narrated (by me, as SGM, the respondent to MS's initiation) as the agreement that if he actively stands with the priest, he'll be killed, but if not, he will live.<br/><br/>Gray Dove, meanwhile, has retreated to the mesatop, where she sees the approach of a panting runner from Bead Water, who brings news of a revolt in two days -- handing her a knotted cord with 2 knots on it. Gray Dove takes the cord and then later speaks to Morning Song about the timing of the pan-Pueblo revolt.<br/><br/>But Morning Song can't wait that long! Or so says Thomas, who wants to see how the system handles her internal battle. The conflict is her Blood Red against the Turquoise (Community) of the Story Cord -- somewhere, the Gold outermost Ephemeral was lost -- and she loses. Which means Thomas narrates. And so, in the dark outside of the church, Morning Song contemplates bursting in a day early and murdering the attempted-rapist Priest, knife in her hand.<br/><br/>She eventually decides against it, Thomas says, but as she's going to leave, she's spotted by the Priest's visitor -- who is none other than her father, the Mayor, speaking to the Priest. She drops the knife and runs back toward Eagle Shadow, across the plaza, as the Mayor comes out, and we rush toward a climax of the story.<br/><br/>Gray Dove steps forward and confronts the Mayor and the Priest. And she gets backhanded by the Mayor, as the Priest retreats back into the church. "Silence, woman!" Morning Song is doing that social conflict thing again, and as she is successful, the crowd murmursin agreement with the Mayor's daughter that he's lost the right to lead. "Eagle Shadow should be Mayor!" is the cry from the crowd.<br/><br/>Chasing the priest into the church, Gray Dove -- who isn't the most physical person with only one Blood Red bead ("farming makes me feel ALIVE") -- nevertheless pushes past the Priest's attempts to barricade the door, and they start wrestling over possession of a large gold crucifix ("The power of Christ compels you, witch of Satan!"), resolving into a push to be continued next time the scene cuts back to them.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Eagle Shadow wants to kill the Mayor, and is preparing to shoot with his stolen rifle. Morning Song jumps in front of the shot, knocking the blunderbuss aside (and narrowly avoiding being shot) to win the conflict, letting Dad live. The last Conflict bead, a Blood Red one, is removed from the Story Bead and given to MS, who threads it and is now really, really Blood Red (something like 4 or 5 Red beads at the end of the game). The Mayor is exiled, instead of shot in the back.<br/><br/>We cut back to Gray Dove -- and the Priest releases the crucifix, SGM suddenly having remembered the historical priests' desires for holy martyrdom. He falls to his knees, praying "O, Lord, into your hands I commend my spirit! Let my death to these heathens glorify your name!" Gray Dove hesitates, then takes the pointy crucifix and stabs him in the heart.<br/><br/>The revolution has begun, early. The Mayor is exiled, and the Priest is dead. What next? No more Conflict beads left on the Story Cord.<br/><br/>There's not an endgame section in the Game Chef PDF version -- and there should be one in the new version -- so we resolve that each person goes around and narrates an epilogue for their character. Ideally it should be based on what beads are left on the cord.<br/><br/>Gray Dove's epilogue has her in the kiva, lighting a fire and slowly feeding the scraps of the Priest's star maps into the flames.<br/><br/>Morning Song's epilogue takes place much later, with her having many children and married to the new Mayor, Eagle Shadow. But then Thomas decides that sucks, compared to Matt's epilogue for Gray Dove, and rewrites it to a closer time period, with a stoic Morning Song, with baby, receiving back the body of her husband, who died as a result of the revolution which MS wanted so badly.<br/><br/>Spider Grandmother's epilogue had the Mayor running for days, parched and exhausted, to Santa Fe, the capital of the Spanish occupation, to warn the Governor. He pleaded for entry while vowing his loyalty to the Crown, only to find out that the coordinated revolt led to Santa Fe's fall to the Pueblo people, and a war captain shot a hole through his head with a captured rifle.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70977/#Comment_70977" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T00:36:33+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 12:36AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Tactile Sensations</b><br/><br/>The players really, REALLY liked the cords. The cords were just plain fun to play with, to feel, to knot around their fingers, and so on. Matt was barely able to resist tying the cord around his head.<br/><br/>The beads worked too. One thing I really like about this game is the feel of it -- the sensations, having something to do with your hands. You get that in D&amp;D and other traditional roleplaying games as well, but it's more invisible. You don't REALIZE how important it is to play with the funny shaped dice (people are ALWAYS touching them, have you noticed?) until you start playing with something else instead!<br/><br/><b>All in All</b><br/><br/>It was a really good playtest. It identified for me what I needed to fix -- more introduction materials for getting into and explaining the game -- and what worked. I particularly like the narration control rules and the way that the Story Cord works.

The Story Cord itself worked just for EVERY CONFLICT that resulted in the game.<br/><br/>The Story Cord retained the use as a game "timer" that Spider Grandmother's cord holds in the PDF version -- when the Story Cord loses all its Conflict beads (akin to Ephemeral beads on player cords), it's time to wrap up the game.</blockquote>\nThis is interesting, and is something I was wondering about when reading the GC version -- the idea of NPC cords seemed cool, but the idea of having the Story Thread dominate also seemed to have its advantages. <br/><br/>One thing I am curious about, though: if the Story Cord is the pacing mechanism, as well as the only cord PCs have conflicts against, doesn't that mean that conflicts actually get <i>easier</i> as the game progresses? Especially with your comment about how the Story Cord shouldn't get beads from players?<br/><br/>Did you notice that kind of trend in play? Or is the difference between the number of beads too small, given the variety of colours? On the one hand it seems like it might make things too predictable, but on the other hand it's a pretty typical story arc -- at the beginning, protagonists experience setbacks (SC has lots of beads), but eventually they triumph in the end (SC has fewer beads).<br/><br/>The other thing is that if the players know they are only going to challenge against the Story Cord, it makes the whole 'choose your colour of beads' kind of predictable as well. Which is to say, the opponent in a conflict always has the same spread of resources (the same number of beads of each colour, approximately, on its cord). One thing having NPC cords allows for is variety in conflicts, in terms of what colours/types of action are likely to be successful -- but if the SC always has the same variety of beads, it might make it too easy for players to plan accordingly, and get into a rut in terms of problem solving approaches? The draw-beads mechanic adds a fairly small amount of variance, especially if I have a character with 3+ beads of one colour -- if that's a colour that's rare on the SC, am I not just going to dominate the game by always initiating conflicts with that colour?<br/><br/>Or, again, am I overestimating the uniformity of things, given the ability to use the external/ephemeral bead colour in response?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_71009">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71009/#Comment_71009" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T05:52:47+00:00" title="May 22, 2007  5:52AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, congratulations on a successful playtest!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71089/#Comment_71089" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T10:38:23+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 10:38AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really love the description of the tactile elements of this game.

Or so says Thomas, who wants to see how the system handles her internal battle. The conflict is her Blood Red against the Turquoise (Community) of the Story Cord -- somewhere, the Gold outermost Ephemeral was lost -- and she loses. Which means Thomas narrates. And so, in the dark outside of the church, Morning Song contemplates bursting in a day early and murdering the attempted-rapist Priest, knife in her hand.<br/><br/>She eventually decides against it, Thomas says, but as she's going to leave, she's spotted by the Priest's visitor -- who is none other than her father, the Mayor, speaking to the Priest. She drops the knife and runs back toward Eagle Shadow, across the plaza, as the Mayor comes out, and we rush toward a climax of the story.</blockquote>\nWith the game mechanics, we threw down Morning Song's red beads (for passion and bloodlust) against what her rash actions would mean to the community as a whole if the revolution began before the other villages were ready.  This was represented by SGM's turquoise (community) beads.  Although Morning Song had something like three reds on her cord to begin with, Kynn managed to outdraw me on the random bead grab.  The result was Morning Song wasn't going to be able to kill the priest and I had to pop the outermost bead off of her character cord.  This bead was turquoise which meant that Morning Song's failure had to result in her losing face in the community.<br/><br/>This played out by having Morning Song ready to kill the priest, entering the priest's quarters but shocked to find her father meeting with the priest.  The two men started shouting, which brought out townspeople to see what was going on.  Morning Song froze, dropped her knife, and ran from the scene while her fellow villagers watched.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71108/#Comment_71108" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T11:41:25+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 11:41AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's right!

When creating Morning Song, she wound up with three red beads (passion, blood, physicality).  This made her pretty tough when it came to scenes that drew from powerful emotions, especially at the end when we saw her with four beads.  But this is balanced by the size of the story cord -- characters start with nine beads and can lose all but five and still be alive and effective, but the story cord starts with 10 plus the number of players and can only go down to eight before the endgame.<br/><br/>The story did have that typical story arc feel.  Both Matt and I blew or pushed early conflicts, but when the story came around to provoking the community to act through Morning Song's rabble-rousing, she was dominating social conflicts because of her three red beads.  Even at the last conflict -- Morning Song jumping in front of her new husband's rifle -- I think we tied.  (Morning Song didn't get to jump in front of the gun and Eagle Shadow didn't get to kill her father.  We narrated that she pushed the rifle aside and he missed.)  Things seemed easier in the last part of the game for me, but that's probably because Morning Song was involved in conflicts she was very powerful in.<br/><br/>Also with the way characters are built, you can't have beads of the same color next to each other.  This results in a character with three beads of any color placing them in the Ephemeral section of the cord, which run a good chance of being popped off.  From our play, character strength boils down to this:  1 bead = weak, 2 = average, 3 = strong, 4 = massive, 5 = uber.  However, those strong, massive, and uber beads are going to be in the Ephemeral section and could easily be popped off if the conflict doesn't involve them.  That is, if Morning Song was involved in a spiritual-based conflict, she only had one white bead.  Losing that conflict, her outermost bead (red) would have been popped and she would have been weaker in blood-based conflicts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_71112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D" title="Thomas D"><img alt="Thomas D" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://landfill.thesnakefarm.com/images/misc/idescols.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thomas%20D">Thomas D</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/71112/#Comment_71112" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-22T11:49:28+00:00" title="May 22, 2007 11:49AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I really love the description of the tactile elements of this game.
