You know what I mean: Howard, Lieber, Burroughs, Moorcock. So I'm looking for something that is a better fit.<br/><br/>Based on a (very) brief overview I'm seeing a few options:<br/><br/><i>Jaws of the Six Serpents</i> (don't own, some familiarity with PDQ)<br/><i>Sorcerer/Sorcerer and Sword</i> (don't own, no familiarity)<br/><i>In a Wicked Age</i> (own, have not run/play)<br/><i>Burning Wheel</i> (own, have played briefly, but not run)<br/><br/>So, what I'm looking for is ideas for play, other systems to consider, strengths and weaknesses of different systems for this kind of play, and particularly, strength and weaknesses of different systems for one-on-one play, since getting my group together is something of a challenge.<br/><br/>Thanks in advance,<br/><br/>-Adam                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210398">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210398/#Comment_210398" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T15:17:05+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  3:17PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 4, 2009 3:17PM by johnzo.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IAWA is like sweet peppered honey to me, and I have had a good time running it for small groups of me + 2 or 3 players.  That said, I think a lot of the goodness of IAWA comes from player-on-player conflict, so a one-on-one game is suboptimal in my view.  Whatever game you do wind up playing, though, I'd see if you could import that IAWA oracles into it.  They, more than anything else, give IAWA its sexy sword-and-sorcery feel.<br/><br/>I have heard about lots of people having fun with one-on-one Burning Wheel, since BW is all about generating characters who are layered and interesting and worthy of a story, and it's cool not having to split spotlight time between more than one character like that.  In fact, the one game of BW I played had three fascinating characters who barely interacted for the first few sessions.<br/><br/>(and everyone was cool with that, tho I felt bad for the poor GM who had to interleave three completely independent storylines...) <br/><br/>Since you've up-powered your D&amp;D guy, and since characters like Conan and Fafhrd are highly capable, I'm guessing you want a pretty epic character power level.  I think BW has got you covered there as well.  The edition I played had tiers of power (I remember them named after colors, but I'm not sure) that affected your per-die target number.<br/><br/>Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210399/#Comment_210399" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T15:19:50+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  3:19PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, what is it that you want out of  Howard, Lieber, Burroughs, Moorcock?<br/><br/>Because any of the games you've listed could bring out different elements.<br/><br/>For one-on-one play, my experiences lately with Burning Wheel have been great, here are the AP threads from our game set in the <a href="http://www.burningwheel.org/forum/tags.php?tag=13+cities" rel="nofollow">13 Cities.</a><br/><br/>I think Sorcerer/Sorcerer &amp; Sword works great too but I have not played it as a solo game but I think it'd be solid for that kind of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_210400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210400/#Comment_210400" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T15:26:25+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  3:26PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what I want is the idea of a lone character or small group of very competent characters exploring a world that is populated, but hardly "known" or "civilized".

In Sorcerer &amp; Sword the source of adversity is clearly centralized in the GM.  The GM is expected to play the demons as a source of pressure, the world as a source of pressure, and so on.  As such it requires a GM who enjoys hitting the PCs are in an uncompromising way and willing to let the consequences stand without flinching or back peddling.  If you don't like being an aggressive (which not the same as "winning" or an asshole) then I don't think Sorcerer &amp; Sword is a good pick.<br/><br/>In A Wicked Age... however tends to spread things out a bit more.  The GMs job in that game is play the characters which the players don't choose.  Those choices may or may not include the primary source of adversity.  It might very well be the case that one of the players steps up to fulfill that fictional role.  The GM need only worry about adversity when there's a notable absence of it.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210407/#Comment_210407" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-04T15:59:58+00:00" title="June  4, 2009  3:59PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judd;<br/><br/>Really digging the AP thread for Horselord Prince!

Very detailed, Mouse Guard is a lighter version of the system but still retains much crunch although the focus is less worldy than the fiction you mention.<br/><br/>Sorcerer makes your character mighty, especially as regards other mere mortals but the magic system is very focussed on demon summoning and it's also not really a tactical game.

Which is fine, of course, but it is a point of distinction between BoL and IAWA and BW.</blockquote>\nThere is the rule for describing how your character's activities between sessions, with a focus on how he or she used the treasure from the previous adventure. If I recall correctly, you can earn a Hero Point by setting up some situation for the next game. While the rule isn't completely explicit, I would play these intersessions as a time when players establish new situations and kickers for their characters. I think the bonus Hero Point should be the GM's way of saying "We're going to use your idea in the next session."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_210836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/210836/#Comment_210836" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-08T00:23:24+00:00" title="June  8, 2009 12:23AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a game called "On Mighty Thews" which does Howard and Moorcock sword-and-sorcery pretty well.
