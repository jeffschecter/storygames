                    "I like these calm little moments before the storm.                <br/>It reminds me of Beethoven.              <br/>Can you hear it? <br/>It's like, when you put your head to the grass.  <br/>You can hear it growing.<br/>You can hear the insects, bzzzz..."<br/><br/> - Gary Oldman's Character from Leon or the Professional<br/><br/><a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/51770.html" rel="nofollow">I was reading this recent post of John Kim's LJ</a> and he quotes Robert (Scorpio Rising) talking about Bang-driven play.<br/><br/>It just seems like there is this view of those who play Nar-heavy games that we sit in a circle and kick each other in the nuts for four hours yelling "BANG!" with each kick, pat each other on the back and go home to write AP threads about how awesome it is that our metaphorical testicles are sore.<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>Player 1: Then the demon humps your PC's head!<br/><br/>Player 2:  Dude!  I have that trait about having my head humped!<br/><br/>Player 1:  I know!<br/><br/>Player 3: Aw man, and this now triggers my trait about getting cold nut-kicking vengeance upon anyone who allows that demon, who I'm in love with, to hump their head!<br/><br/>My favorite part of the techniques, like Bangs, Ron mentions in the Sorcerer books is that they put names to effective practices that I was bringing to the table.  Identifying them meant that I could watch out for them and instead of swinging in the dark, my GMing became more precise.<br/><br/>But Bangs weren't the only things in the books.<br/><br/>Crosses, Weavings, Openings and Bobs from Sex &amp; Sorcery get used by me a whole lot but they are odd little moments and difficult for me to remember or really parse out for an AP post.<br/><br/>I can recall one L5R game where our stalwart samurai PC's were really getting hammered by oni and cultists and conspiracies and I really wanted a number of scenes, before the final big ole battle, where we could just chill for a bit.  I wanted that calm before the storm and when we didn't get it, I was bummed.<br/><br/>I just wanted us to chill in a bath-house for a scene, talk about what we had discovered and let the epic nature of our discoveries sink in.  Those quiet moments make the powerful bangs more meaningful.<br/><br/>So, anyway, some things to go back and re-read for me and I'm going to try to look out for them in play and mention them in future AP posts right along-side the BANGS and the kicks to the groin.                </div>

                            Judd,<br/><br/>I think perhaps the term for the kind of thing you wanted for your Samuri is a Sequel.  A Sequel is what happens after a Scene(s) where a character(s) responds emotionally and intellectually to the fallout from the last scene before setting sights on the next scene.  It is that kind of calm before/between the storms.  In writing novels they are used for pacing and building character empathy.

                            Judd,<br/><br/>I think The Mountain Witch does a nice job of almost requiring these "breather" scenes occasionally.  The first time I played that game, we had some interesting battles in the forest and finally reached what we thought was the wall to enter the castle.  We were bruised, battered and low on trust; which meant that it was no longer easy for us to help each other.  We decided to camp next to the wall for the night and make this our last scene of the session.  The GM stood back and just let us talk to each other.  It was our first real chance to relax and start to hint at our dark fates.  And the 5-10 minute conversation that ensued around the campfire was one of the highlights of the game.  We had already been through a lot and knew the next session might end up kicking our asses (as it did).  There was a lot of maneuvering around trust issues that just couldn't happen when your katana was wet with blood.                        </div>

                            I often call them "breathers", "counterpoints", or simply "reflectors" -- from horror movie pacing words, mostly. (Where if you go from scene to scene of Jason hitting someone with an ax it becomes silly quickly.) <br/><br/>I've heard others call them based on tempo and cadence musical terms -- like those found here: <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m11648/latest/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cnx.org/content/m11648/latest/</a><br/><br/>and here: <a href="http://cnx.org/content/m12402/latest/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://cnx.org/content/m12402/latest/</a><br/><br/>Things like "Cadence point" or "grave tempo" could be useful, I guess, if'n you already know a bit about music.                        </div>

                            I love Oldman's character in The Professional, and I can recall the scene with that line with frightning vividness.<br/><br/>re: the nut kicking.  Funny metaphor in a cringey way.  Been watching Idiocracy by any chance?<br/><br/>I've always tried to to include those kind of scenes as a GM, but I've also found that they seem to occur pretty naturally, and often on the initiative of the players.  There's a foreshadowing thing you can do in describing a setting as calm and tranquil (hopefully without using those words) just before the storm, that can really create a cool tension.  I think tonal qualites and facial expressions are at least as important than the actual language used in setting those scenes.  A whispered reverence.  In a campaign that's full of both bangs and darkness, it's nice to have some places where the sunshine filters in and the players get that sense of how ephemeral their peace is likely to be, but to appreciate it while it lasts.                        </div>

<blockquote>Pacing, one of the most crucial and generally overlooked (in discussion, not necessarily practice) elements of roleplaying.</blockquote>
And gaming in general.  I design video games for a living, and the cadence of game play is almost as important as the challenges and rewards you are giving the player.  But like you said, it often gets overlooked in favor of things like eye-candy and giving tchotchkes to the player.<br/><br/>Hopefully not OT, but there was an interesting article last year about a system of gameplay notation for videogames:<br/><br/><a href="http://lostgarden.com/2006/01/creating-system-of-game-play-notation.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://lostgarden.com/2006/01/creating-system-of-game-play-notation.html</a> </div>

<p>So Judd, you're saying, "Let's talk about pacing"?</p>
<p>Let's talk about pacing, and maybe we can even do so in a way that doesn't exclude those people who don't have Ron's games.</p>

That sounds about right.<br/><br/>And even more than that, I'm saying let's talk about pacing and take it to our AP threads and think about it as we play in the coming months.<br/><br/>But specifically, I was talking about the techniques outlined in Ron's books.                        </div>

                            Bobs are simple -- they're a break, a rest, or a delay. Heroes does this to us every fucking week. In game its where you say, "Okay, but before you can kill the evil wizard you have a day of travel. Why don't we play out a brief scene at camp the night before as you all face the prospect you could die tomorrow" or anything like that. Its pretty much just taking a moment to reflect, build investment, and do some shit that isn't punching someone in the cock. <br/><br/>A weave is moving two different plots, especially two different kicker based plots or major NPC goals closer together. So say you've got one PC who has been chasing his long lost father because he's needing money and another who is closing in on the asshole mob-boss who raped his sister so he can kill him. The two then get clues to the identity of dad and mob-boss, and as it turns out its the same guy. Now the PCs are headed towards each other and the NPC at the speed of blood opera.                        </div>

                            Yes, Brand, that is very good.  I also like moving "at the speed of blood opera."<br/>
<br/>
I've been trying to watch Battlestar Galactica (Hot Chicks Version) more analytically lately, and it seems that it's way, way bang-heavy, with lots of weaves as the characters turn on each other and you know there's confrontation comin'.  In most of the bad-ass episodes, there's not a moment of bobbing at all--until you get entire episodes that are basically nothing but bobbing (supposedly to build investment but usually you know nothing important's going to happen, so it's like those scenes in an RPG where people are just kicking back without engaging in conflict of any kind).  The fact that an entire episode is filler material, sometimes, is the one major flaw of the series that I can see.<br/>
<br/>
(Has nothin' to do with anything, except that BSG (HCV) usually has pretty good pacing, and <i>also</i> really good use of bangs--often bangs which cut across 3-4 characters <i>at once</i>, which is pretty cool.)                        </div>

                            OK, example of a weave from actual play:<br><br>This one guy totally falls for the beautiful wife of an Austro-Hungarian spy.  He and Tatiana Subacic have a brief moment of illicit passion before tearfully parting ways, being from different worlds and all that.  Later this guy and his pals (the PCs) get her husband sort of killed in a fantastic plane crash.  <br><br>At the same time the characters are chasing the villain, the insidious King Lung, master of disguise, mind control, and making cool bombs.  King Lung mocks and thwarts them, and issues villainous challenges right and left.  He's a real bastard and they can't wait to sink their teeth into him.  They chase King Lung across continents, across years.  He tries to blow up New York with acid bombs.  He's kick-ass.<br/><br/>Four years later they've got him on the ropes.  They chase him to Cuba.  They kick in the doors of his secret base and kill some of his dudes, and he barely escapes.  Weirdly, King Lung leaves behind a three year old orphan.  WTF, King Lung?  And weirder, it makes him desperate - he <i>kidnaps Theodore Roosevelt</i> and offers to trade him for the anonymous kid.  The players start to make the connection.<br/><br/>The PCs are on King Lung like a hydrophobic dog, all except one guy, who is a little reluctant now ... but to hell with him, they shoot down Lung's airship.  They bust in and there "he" is - King Lung, Tatiana Subacic, the revenging widow, tearfully dying.<br/><br/>The point of attack for inter-connection is pretty late, so maybe that's not a textbook weave.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            Ah! Thanks for the thread, guys. This makes sense of part of Contenders for me.<br/><br/>You can't just immediately request a fight scene. You have to have a promotion scene, where you chat to the promoter and beg/plead/demand a fight. This also lets everyone else round the table know they have one more scene before a fight goes down, before everything changes.<br/><br/>So when a promotion comes up, everyone looks around and goes 'Uh-oh'.<br/><br/>Joe.                        </div>

                            Yeah, Contenders seems like a brilliant example of mechanically-imposed bobs.  And the ability to target other character's connections leads to weaves almost automatically.                        </div>

                            What about the scenes where there's not a direct connection (such as your archnemesis being my long-lost father), but just a connection between one scene and another, tieing them together in some way? Do those also count as Weaves?  Every Guy Ritchie movie, most Quentin Tarantino movies have lots of these.  <br/><br/>An game-specific example would be that Bob's character, a mighty-thewed barbarian, has just singlehandedly beaten up everybody in the tavern and stalked off into the night.  <br/><br/>Jumping over to Steve's character, a nervous wizard, who is about to meet his contact in a tavern, walks in and finds the place totally thrashed and his contact unconscious under the table.  <br/><br/>When you do this hard and frequent, it's comical.  If you use a little subtlety, it really brings the world to life, and it helps tie the separate threads of story together -- which is really important in games like Sorcerer where there's no party structure.                        </div>

                            Danny, <br/><br/>I'd say that particular example is a weavey thing. Sometimes that's just coherence though -- which is something I've occasionally found lacking in RPGs.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DannyK</cite>which is really important in games like Sorcerer where there's no party structure.</blockquote>
There's no traditional party structure but there can be as much or as little structure as the players who create their characters and author their kickers want.<br/><br/><br/>When I start games of Dictionary of Mu at cons I say flat out to my players, "Your characters are scattered all over Marr'd.  If you want to be in a scene with another character, make it happen, talk about it with the other players and let's see it at the table.  We only have four hours and we can only draw this all togethre if we work together."<br/><br/>And it works, players watch and weave and bob and such all on their own.  It is pretty damned cool what introducing everyone to each other as players, saying flat-out in the beginning of the session that talking to each other as players as well as role-playing is important and having the players help with the lifting is key in all of this.                        </div>

                            Oop, Judd beat me to it. It's not precisely the same thing, but PC weaving by players is yet another technique of this sort that people should comment on in their AP posts. My players do it so constantly lately that I haven't framed a scene in... a long time. It's all like Chris saying, "Oh, I know, I can get Agnes into a scene with Teodric by having her want to talk to him about getting access" and the like. With the goal of getting them together in a scene because we know with OOC knowledge that, if we do, their purposes will become inter-woven.<br/>
<br/>
It shouldn't need to be said, but these techniques go on and on. Ron has only enumerated some of the most potent or obvious ones. Think about your play, and how doing X to get some story element going is something that is done often. Or even one-shot techniques developed on the spot (so maybe they get used again by somebody else).<br/>

This thread got away from me.<br><br>I said I'd get back to it and Andy has said that necromancy is encouraged.<br/><br/>So, here we are.<br/><br/>Bobs, as mentioned in Sex and Sorcery, are moments that pause before the action.<br/><br/>There was a neat bob this past Friday's Houses of the Blooded, where two PC's were about to have this intense conversation.  This young opera loving baron and this old crotchety wizard were the PC's.  The old sorcerer's son had been wounded while in the care of the opera lover.<br/><br/>So, Anthony goes through this ritual they must do before they talk about the blood spilled.  The washing of the hands, the washing of the face, the washing of the feet.  And he went on for a while which, rather than being annoying, kind of made the tension delicious, the big tease.<br/><br/>Weaving, also mentioned in Sex and Sorcery is something I do with the other players' help a whole lot in the Dictionary of Mu con games.  I tell the players that their pre-written kickers would normally be written by them but for the con, I go with pre-written stuff.  So, if they want to meet another player, they need to angle their character towards them, if not out and out talk about it a bit and talk about a scene they'd like to see.<br/><br/>So the Khan of Khans begins play after being crucified on the desert floor to show his ability to be the Khan of Khans and meanwhile, the Primite Prince lets his human slaves go in a glimmer of conscious, realizing that these humans have souls.  Naturally, the people run into the Khan of Khan's horde and naturally the Primite realizes that without his help, the people he just let go will be run down and killed without his help.<br/><br/>That kinda thing.                        </br></br></div>

                            Thanks for resurrecting this. Great reminder about the idea of narrative in narrativism.  Bobs, weaves, crosses, flashbacks, forwards etc. are all literary devices. We are doing great things with bringing thematic resonance into our play, making our games matter to us, but we're still figuring out more complex ways of exploring the stories we are finding to tell.  This is a great form--we can do anything they do in film, books, and more. But a straight linear narrative has been mostly what we've been doing. <br/><br/>Rock!                        </div>

Having just watched The Killing last night, and having read the recent how to do time travel thread, I'm wondering, how do we incorporate a non-linear narrative?<br/><br/>For example,

How do you do that in reverse order? How do you do Steve's encounter in a busted up tavern and then frame to Bob's encounter earlier in the day in the same tavern, unbusted?                        </div>

                            Ooh, ooh!  I've got a great example of a weave from a now defunct Houses of the Blooded game.<br/><br/>One of the players comes back to his rooms after a party to find a Duke in bed with his wife.  He becomes violent and chases the Duke out a window, grabbing the duke's arcane brass hand, a sorcerer king's artifact.<br/><br/>The Duke jumps out a window naked and the PC is left holding his disconnected brass artifact hand.<br/><br/>Cut Scene.<br/><br/>Next is a quiet moment with another PC and his wife.  They are having a quiet moment together, talking about the night's going's on, the political implications of various marriages and snubs and such at the party.  It is a really nice conversation, very pragmatic but also obviously it is two smart people who were married not out of love but out of a political/business arrangement between their families and yet, they have found peace and affection with one another, enjoying each other's company.<br/><br/>And the Duke, minus one hand, slams through the window, having just jumped out to escape the other PC's wrath.<br/><br/>The Duke apologizes for the intrusion.  Bob's character suavely offers the Duke a robe so that he could find his way back to his room if need be.<br/><br/>Neat.                        </div>

The game encourages you to label scene elements that you'd like to see in later scenes.  We had a scene about the evil sorcerer character Black Jade, in which his henchman Fox Slave is playing a mandolin to hypnotic effect.  When the scene ended, someone wrote down "mandolin".<br/><br/>In a later scene, when the young warrior character Bao Li and his cousin Jin Si are attacked and knocked out, I said, "Jin Si awakens and is distraught that her mandolin is gone!"  We had vaguely discussed that this scene probably preceded other scenes we'd played, but this made it definite.                        </div>

My criminal character Spider had spent Act I setting two others at odds, for a reason that we hadn't really gotten around to specifying yet.  Weirdly, the other two characters (Deputy Jimmie and Sheriff Bo) still figured that they were in a position to push my guy around; we reckoned, when we talked about it a bit, that we'd figure out why in a later scene.  At the halftime break, we got an oracle pointing to "cold-blooded score settling."  For my first scene in Act II, we flashed back to four years previous and my guy being arrested by those two characters, who took the opportunity to steal his stuff and humiliate him, plus send him to jail where a guy he'd ratted out was waiting.  They understood this to be a manifestation of their dominance, but Spider saw it as intolerable and something to be avenged.  Everything fell into place and we wound up with a really satisfying mess.                        </div>

                            Boy.  I <b>really</b> dislike the terms "Bob and Weave".  It is a boxing term (and I've heard in fighter pilot jargon alongside "juke and jive" and it implies action).  These scenes are not about  defensive action, they are the opposite of action.  They are the quiet moments, maybe ratcheting up tension, but are still quiet comparatively.  <br/><br/>I dislike Sequels as well.  They are  not Sequels.  Sequels imply a whole new story based on characters and/or events of the last story.  These are small scenes... not the entire enchilada.  <br/><br/>Breathers makes sense to me.  But really, these  are just scenes that are not action oriented.  If an "Act" is the main dramatic unit, the Scene is one component of an Act.  So, these, to me, seem to be a Quiet Scene.  Or even Exploratory Scene as the characters try to navigate through the chaos around them.                        </div>

                            It seems to me that refreshment scenes, from The Shadow of Yesterday, are a perfect example of System-enforced Bobs or Sequels.<br/><br/>I do a similar thing in my game The Camel's Egg, where character need to play to their Key Traits (kind of like their Issues) to regain resources spent in conflict. The idea is that if you're stuck in prison, you might need to tell your cellmate about your lost innocence or your goal of marrying so-and-so before you're ready to play through the daring escape.<br/><br/>I've had a lot of success with mechanically enforced Weaves, as well, in several different games: Land of Nodd, which Dave describes earlier, and a storytelling game which makes storylines based on the interaction of two important story elements. Simply recombining those elements in new permutations tends to draw the plot together and create interesting climaxes in the story. For instance, one storyline might be about how "the King" plans to rescue "his daughter", and another might be about how "the criminal" wants to steal "the crown jewels". Well, in the next phase of the game, we might have the criminal trying to become King, and the daughter trying to seduce him into telling her where he's hidden the jewels.<br/><br/>This sort of thing is fun and works really well!                        </div>

I disagree, Storn.  Using the techniques is an action.  It is the GM doing something decisive to make the game more compelling.  But, as stated above, I'm really not interested in critiquing the word choices and much more interested in hearing about examples of play and use.                        </div>

Umm, I've never read <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sex</i>, so I've never gotten a formal explanation of the various techniques, but isn't that example actually a Cross?<br/><br/>I thought a Cross was when you take an effect from one scene and place it into a later, non-connected scene. So here, the the duke jumps out the window in one scene and then emerges in the next, but as far as I can tell from your description, there's no particular story significance to the duke's appearance.<br/><br/>PS---What's an "Opening"?                        </div>

                            So Weaves and Crosses---how well do they work as general GM techniques, or are they better used in situations where you have independent or semi-independent PCs? It seems to me that their primary purpose is to create continuity between otherwise non-connected story threads. For example, I use them all the time in tMW (particularly Weaves), but I have a hard time seeing how I would use them in, say, Dogs (maybe in very specific situations, but not as part of a general strategy).<br/><br/>Also, the way I understand Bobs (or whatever you want to call them) is that they can be a little more than just "quiet scenes", they can also include dramatic cuts that delay the resolution of a particular situation. Like, a couple is arguing when all of the sudden the women says, "I'm pregnant!"... <i>aaaand CUT!</i> </div>

                            I ran a game of Delta Green d20 a while back. It was a pulpy game. The whole theme of the game was Strong Women and the adversary was Shub-Niggurath. One of the characters was psychic, and his spirit guide had the appearance of Diana Princess of Wales. Another character was haunted by the death of his sister who had protected him from his violent father. Wonder Woman kept turning up as a motif, either someone in fancy dress or Linda Carter doing a signing, or a crumpled comic in the street.<br/><br/>Is that a weave?                        </div>

I disagree, Storn.  Using the techniques is an action.  It is the GM doing something decisive to make the game more compelling.  But, as stated above, I'm really not interested in critiquing the word choices and much more interested in hearing about examples of play and use.<br/><br/>But terminology and shared language is important.  Especially when discussing something of such nuance.  Your statement above illustrates my point.  You said the GM is "doing".  It doesn't have to be the GM.  The scenes you are talking about, I've felt over the years can happen quite organically at the table.  Maybe a player starts such a scene and everyone is going for it.  <br/><br/>If you want examples, I have one.  In the Four Aces campaign about modern horror, we often had the 4 Aces (eventually 5 players) taking a break at their favorite NYC irish bar.  Things would get so tense and the stakes so high, the players starting going, "wow, our characters really need to talk this over a beer or three... this is nuts and we have to check in with each other".    I don't think we ever labeled it.  But out of those scenes, entire NPCs came forth, like the cross dressing waitress (waiter?) and the bar itself became an important focal point, even to the point of getting stats as a mystical haven for the PCs.    Sometimes these "refresher" scenes were quite short and could be "bobs"   Because they often did lead to the next scene, sometimes even starting in media res.  <br/><br/>And now that I think about it, Judd, I've heard you talk about a couple of your examples a few times over the last few years.  The BW example of the guys in the tavern before the big climax.  And it seems to me, that it was the players who kinda drove that.  Not the GM setting it up.  <br/><br/>I think in games where one is getting Banged and Kicked a lot... .there is a real need for small, interpersonal, connective scenes.  At least I feel it.  One of my favorite scenes was Judd's bastard Wizard in BW having breakfast over at his beloved's manor trying to impress her rough hewn, just barely noble father.  While there was a duel of wits conflict, it was so low level, so mundane and gosh.... cute.... it became one of my favorite scenes of the entire campaign.  So dice hit the table, but it wasn't Sturm and drang at all.  <br/><br/>But it was in a game of political ambition, so many conflicts around that small scene were big and weighty.  <br/><br/>So hearing Judd talk about the lack of such a scene in his L5R game really resonated with me.  I've felt that way before too.                        </div>
