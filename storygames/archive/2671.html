There's a big in-game secret in the setting - Namely that the Kafers (bad-guy aliens), who are usually as dumb as a box of rocks, get much smarter when under stress.  This is a big deal because once the PCs discover it they can start using it to their advantage, and because it reveals a great deal about the Kafers motivations for war.<br/><br/>The problem here is 2300AD is a pretty old game and (at least amongst my players) a lot of people know this big secret.  Now, we're all grownups so we're not going to abuse this, but now the problem changes from "what is the big secret" to "how do I justify my character finding out this secret (or do I)".  So now the players have to start watching for small details to justify their characters figuring it out.<br/><br/>I recall reading something similar in the Durham3 actual play of Cold City on the Forge (search function is down, if someone could provide a link I'd be grateful).  In this case all the players know all the characters agendas, making the players have to look for small details to justify their characters getting wise to their fellow RPA members national agendas.<br/><br/>I personally don't find either of those situations palatable as a player.  It just doesn't sound fun.  So how about adding a game mechanic aspect to the revelation of secrets...<br/><br/><i>All the secrets below are know to the Players, but not initially to the Characters.</i><br/><br/><b>Secret:</b> Kafers get smarter under stress.<br/><b>Consequence: </b>Any character can uncover this secret after he has encountered the Kafer in battle at least 3 times, but once they do we move from the "Kafer Invasion" phase of the game to "Guerilla Warfare" phase.<br/><br/><b>Secret: </b>Francoise wants to sell twisted tech to the Soviets.<br/><b>Consequence:</b> This secret can be revealed after Francoise has used his Agenda to get bonus dice at least 3 times.  Once his secret is revealed Francoise gets [x] number of Desperation Dice to try and fulfill his agenda before he's caught.<br/><br/>Now the dilemma the players have changes from "How do I justify revealing the secret" to "When do I reveal the secret".  This is (to me) more game-y and tactical and hopefully more fun.<br/><br/>Anyway, just a big post for a little idea.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61339/#Comment_61339" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T12:44:03+00:00" title="March 16, 2007 12:44PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2007 12:44PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, this would also work in carrot-and-stick mode:<br/><br/>Secret: REDACTED, GM EYES ONLY<br/>Consequence: Any character can uncover this secret after he has encountered the Kafer in battle at least 3 times, but once they do we move from the "Kafer Invasion" phase of the game to "Guerilla Warfare" phase.<br/><br/>If there were a bunch of these, and the players got to pick among them, and they all went in different narrative directions based on player choice, that could be really fun.

SA gives a lot of control to the players, and this feels like a neat way for the GM to offer specific paths for the players to go down, and a way to slow them down somewhat - SA characters can run through plot like tissue paper.<br/><br/>Here's one way I'm thinking of doing it:\n<blockquote><b>The Logicians Explore Emotion</b><br/><i>The Secret:</i> The Logician hierarchy is doubting the effectiveness and efficiency of pure logic, and considering a return to emotion. Some of the nobles are even performing experiments to this end.<br/><br/><i>The Reveals:</i> One of the characters is a trusted member of the Logician nobility (Civ: Logician, Society: High Society, Profession: Political or Spy), <b>or</b>, the characters are on missions in Logician space at least three times, and have professions such as Political, Spy, or Metatech Engineer/Researcher, <b>or</b>, the characters are involved in black-ops missions in Logician headquarters.<br/><br/><i>The Lever:</i> A powerful and brilliant member of the monarchy makes the matter public, and casts his or her opinion one direction or the other. (Can be accomplished through political means, blackmail, well-reasoned psychohistorical arguments, even impersonation. Empathy, Magnetism, and Intrigue Themes are appropriate.)<br/><br/><i>The Effects:</i> The Rationalist League fragments, with the majority following a path of slowly returning emotion. A minority of Logicians will refuse this path, becoming a Society dedicated to the value of Logic. They will be particularly common in the Stardwellers and Union. Other fragments will attempt a faster return to emotion, with varying levels of success or disaster.</blockquote>\nPlayers could spend Twists (their plot-changing points) to either accomplish a Reveal or pull a Lever without having to rely on rolls, or could instead use them to change these elements. Someone might spend a Twist through their Comprehension score to just figure out the Secret, or might spend it through Magnetism to lead the Logicians back towards pure logic and away from emotion.<br/><br/>This is a pretty large-scale example; one could certainly use these as a session-planning mechanic as well, to set out interesting bait for the players for a single game.<br/><br/>Very cool idea, Other Colin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61428/#Comment_61428" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T10:26:31+00:00" title="March 18, 2007 10:26AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Somehow Storygames is transmitting directly to my brain.

This being a horror game in the vein of the Grudge, the Ring and the Shining.<br/>\nI was trying to make an investigation game where it was the characters and their abilities that solved the mystery and not the players ability to second guess the GM.<br/>\nTo formalise this the <b>characters</b> have to discover five secrets about the dark place before they can overcome <b>It</b>.<br/>\nThese secrets being:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere is the heart of the Dark Place?<br/>\nWhat happened here?<br/>\nWho is to blame?<br/>\nWhat triggered it all?<br/>\nHow do we overcome it?<br/>\n<br/>\nTo get one of these secrets the players have to risk a contest against IT, and this puts them at a gradually rising risk.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd to my great joy this worked as a charm during playtest once we got our heads around the concept.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt one stage my players guessed the answer to a secret, but since they hadn't won it in play, they had to put their characters at risk to get the secret. This led to a situation one of my players desceribed like this: " At first we were in contorl, then we paniced." Which was just the effect I hoped this would give.<br/>\nThe story ended with one character not willing to pay the price of survival and was thus killed by IT, one commited murder to overcome IT and the third character committed suicide.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point being that this kind of structure works and it opens up two delightful situations in play:<br/>\nA situation:<br/>\n1.Where the players know more than their characters and have to make though choices to bring this information into play.<br/>\n2.Where the characters know more than their players and it can only be discovered through though choices in play.<br/>\nAnd this mix is very exciting in play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it removes the grind and linearity of investigation scenarios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61565/#Comment_61565" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-19T13:48:23+00:00" title="March 19, 2007  1:48PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow!

Here's what jumped to my mind, roughly [i'm not sure i've got it all sorted out in my head, yet]:<br/><br/>The GM (or world creator, perhaps) defines the area in which the secret exists.<br/>The GM defines what it takes to uncover this secret.<br/>The players accomplish uncovering the secret.<br/>The players then define the secret.<br/><br/>So, to go back to the original example, initial setup would look like this:<br/>Secret: Why the Kafers are fighting the war.<br/>Discovery: Three combat encounters with the Kafer.<br/><br/>Once the player(s) have had 3 combat encounters with the Kafer, they then get to make up the secret. It might a right-there-on-the-spot thing. It might be they talk about it for weeks ahead of time. It might be that they know from day one of the game what it's going to be, it's just a matter of getting the power to define it in the game. It might be that different players have competing visions of what it should  be, and therefore end up competing for who accomplishes the "discovery" first.<br/><br/>As i initially envision it, the area of the secret and the key to discovery are both known by the players right from the start. <br/><br/>But either of them could be explicitly secret, themselves--that is, the category or criteria might be secret, not that there *are* secrets or criteria for discovery. "There's a secret that you'll discover after you've had 3 combat encounters with the Kafer." or "There's a secret about why the Kafer are fighting the war." I think the latter would be the least-satisfying, because that's pretty much the traditional way of things, with the players risking flailing about blindly trying to get to the secret. The former is probably pointless--the players already get to define the actual secret, so why not give them the constraints, whatever they may be, ahead of time, so they can spend time thinking about it if they want to, rather than just having it sprung on them. <br/><br/>What i like about this, in contrast with what most others seem to be talking about here, is that it puts it completely in the players' court. It's not a tactical thing, at least not in the sense of "i need X to get Y", but rather a world-creation thing. And it means less preparation burden for the GM (though, of course, potentially more creative burden once the secret is uncovered). Also, since the secrets aren't pre-defined--not even a menu of options--you don't have the 'problem' of reading the rulebook and knowing the answer. It's not about secrets, at all, it's about player world-creation.<br/><br/>OTOH, i really like where the thread is going with codified benefits to the secret, and i don't see an easy way to implement that if the secret could be pretty much anything within a relatively broad aegis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity" title="Sempiternity"><img alt="Sempiternity" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.personal.psu.edu/bcp5010/stefan2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sempiternity">Sempiternity</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62025/#Comment_62025" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-24T10:14:50+00:00" title="March 24, 2007 10:14AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nat,<br/><br/>One thing you could try would be to loosley codify your relatively broad aegis in a range of game-mechanical terms - for instance, something like the Key or Secret creation rules in tSoY - you know the range of potential effects that revealing the secret can grant, but not which ones will be chosen, or the fiction supporting that choice.<br/><br/>I'm thinking that one really cool effect of revealing a secret would be to re-write part of the game's r-map - for something like Verge, or Mendel's starship game, you could have great fun with rules such as "change the weight of a connection", "draw a new connection to the affected node", "break a connection", and so on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_62055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62055/#Comment_62055" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-25T06:54:06+00:00" title="March 25, 2007  6:54AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2007 6:54AM by Vaxalon.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I definitely thing rewriting the r-map is perfect for Amber.<br/><br/>"You discover that Merlin is covertly building a powerful pattern-based assassination construct in a weird shadow, and it is primed to attack Random."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_62095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/62095/#Comment_62095" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-26T01:23:28+00:00" title="March 26, 2007  1:23AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sempiternity</cite>One thing you could try would be to loosley codify your relatively broad aegis in a range of game-mechanical terms - for instance, something like the Key or Secret creation rules in tSoY - you know the range of potential effects that revealing the secret can grant, but not which ones will be chosen, or the fiction supporting that choice.</blockquote>\nYou're thinking along the lines of "the effect of a secret is a +5 in a narrow set of circumstances, or a +1 to everything relating to the secret, or -2 to the cost of learning a group of 5 related skills", say?

It makes the Secret almost like another character in the world.<br/><br/>Create these special Keys on note cards and hand them out to the group OR add them to the character sheets. Anyone can create these but they can only go into effect on the next game session. Anyone can benefit from them.<br/><br/>Let's start with a Secret about the World.<br/><br/>First, find a descriptive phrase that helps people imagine what the secret might be. The secret won't be set in stone, it is to be decided through game play. Someone will be declared to be the Force behind the mystery.<br/><br/>So, let's say:<br/><b>The Forest Watches You</b><br/>So, we have plenty to play with here. A band of rebels could keep their hidden headquarters there, ghosts could haunt the forest, the forest could be alive, an ancient curse permeates the forest, etc ...<br/><br/>Then, set some conditions similar to those found in other Keys.<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><i><br/>Gain 1 XP for entering the forest at night.<br/>Gain 2 XP for starting an uncontrolled fire or killing a large forest denizen.<br/>Gain 5 XP for letting yourself be led or chased into the Heart of the Forest.<br/></i><br/>Then, let play commence. Whenever someone takes an XP for fulfilling a requirement of the Key, the Force Behind the Mystery is given a Pool equal to the amount of XP taken (notice that two players taking 2 XP means that the Force gets 4 points in the Pool).<br/><br/>The point behind the Pool is that you can't stat up the Mysterious Forces beforehand (you'll see why in a moment). This gives the Force some leeway with providing interesting opposition but with the precise knowledge of how powerful they are.<br/><br/>Here's the kicker. Whenever the Force wants some extra dice in a conflict, he takes them from the Pool and <i>announces</i> a clue. This clue must relate to the description of the dice usage. BUT, if one of the players wants, they can also <i>announce</i> a clue, taking a die from the Pool, but it might be Real - it might be a red herring. Either way, they get a bonus. If the Force agrees that the new clue is Real, the Force gets an XP. Whenever the Pool is emptied, it is time to announce a major clue - same rules apply, except that if the Force decides that the clue isn't Real, they have to declare a major Clue. The Force cannot reveal a red herring. The Mystery is solved after the  third or final XP requirement is fulfilled and the Pool depleted, using the same rules as before.<br/><br/>Finally, there's one thing to determine. Other than already described NPCs, the agents of the Mystery shouldn't be that difficult to stat up. The maximum they can receive on any Ability will be be equal to the Level of the Mystery.<br/><br/>Level - Ability Maximum<br/>Minor - Competent (I)<br/>Medi - Adept (2)<br/>Major - Master (3)<br/><br/>This should also be used if there is a 'reward' for solving the mystery. In terms of weapons, a Minor mystery might be worth an Ancient Sword (weapon +1), while a Major mystery might be able to take down the Empress on her Coronation Day (weapon +3).<br/><br/>To reiterate:<br/><br/><b>The Forest Watches You</b><br/><i><br/>Gain 1 XP for entering the forest at night.<br/>Gain 2 XP for starting an uncontrolled fire or killing a large forest denizen.<br/>Gain 5 XP for letting yourself be led or chased into the Heart of the Forest.<br/></i><b>Medi - Adept (2)</b><br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74303/#Comment_74303" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T16:58:28+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  4:58PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thread necromancy!<br/><br/>That sounds really cool, Mark.
