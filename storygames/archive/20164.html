Traditional RPGs have done this for decades by separating the world from the characters and assigning each of these "toys" to the DM and the players respectively. Contemporary RPGs have gone to the other extreme where everything is integrated through the group's interactions and there is not much room for the traditional solo activities like preparing plot beforehand or optimizing a build for a character.<br/><br/>Personally, I love games with full interactivity, but I also understand how people may prefer something where they have their own little corner where they can think things through without the "noise" induced by direct compromises and negotiations.<br/><br/>However, I don't recall any non-traditional RPG where this happens. Is there really only one way of having low interactivity in RPGs?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445134/#Comment_445134" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-08T12:32:25+00:00" title="May  8, 2015 12:32PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, you mean like game design? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445135/#Comment_445135" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-08T12:35:50+00:00" title="May  8, 2015 12:35PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (More seriously, I've thought about this too, and noticed the same thing.

In more traditional forms of gaming, we have miniature painting, adventure writing, character builds, prop-making, costume-preparing, and so forth.

It's very much powerful mythic characters taking turns being awesome, and then solo scenes in between the fights. Your turn is very much a turn of you doing things.<br/><br/>There's definitely nothing like the team-based play in Blades in the Dark, or the helping rules in Mouse Guard.

Games like Baron M\xfcnchhausen have only one narrator with very little influence from the other participants.<br/><br/>These multiplayer solitaire games are a strange thing, like Ticket to Ride, where participants only influence indirectly (like buying up cards, or having attack cards in Dominion) but I think it's a(n unwanted) side effect of a good game mechanic. But sure, I know at least one person who doesn't like RoboRally because other robots can interfere with his thought out track.

It's about each person having some gamespace where they play by themselves. This is easier to identify in boardgames because this is often a real physical space at the table, like my deck in Dominion or my farm in Agricola.<br/><br/>The classic example in RPGs is the DM building encounters/monsters or the player choosing the most effective classes/feats/equipment for a character. However, this works within a forced separation between an imaginary world and its protagonists which, as we know, creates all kinds of problems.<br/><br/>By the way, discussing alternatives leads us to question the role of the party in RPGs, namely as a simple way to have everyone in play during the session. RPGs without a party raise the problem of having a majority of the group always out of play. While it may be fun to just watch while one person plays with the GM, there are several partial or complete solutions that have been implemented. For example: In A Wicked Age PvP, Polaris rotating roles with a fixed number of players, Mouse Guard spotlight management, Wraith: the Oblivion two characters in one, Capes! instant role creation, etc.<br/><br/>However, only in few of these examples does the player have a "safe space". Maybe in Polaris? In Mouse Guard, a player still has to earn enough checks and work within the fiction after the GM's turn.   <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445166/#Comment_445166" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-05-09T15:42:59+00:00" title="May  9, 2015  3:42PM">May 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Isnt't that what gear porn is for?

In fact, you can fairly easily produce both competition and cooperation by having the game rules impose a communal space and/or some sort of scarcity. But since most indie games heavily involve scenes centered on cross-player conflict, you don't exactly start from a point of low interaction from which to grow.<br/><br/>I've found a lot of fruitful design ground by indiefying task resolution, because in low interactivity mode you need quick contributions from players that have clear impacts on the game and fiction. Those impacts should link into the overarching conflicts and how they evolve and are eventually resolved. Those overarching conflicts can then be your communal, scarce place where players eventually cooperate and compete.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>From a similar topic in <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=7412.0" rel="nofollow">Barf Forth Apocalyptica</a>:</i><br/><br/>Recently I've been thinking about <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/438" rel="nofollow">dice &amp; clouds stuff and I believe that it's a good thing to strive for symmetry</a>. That's what RPGs are all about, right? The symmetry can even go to a point where we try to mesh the dice and the clouds together so that one thing can't exist without the other. Still, it can be more of a push-and-pull where different people may lean towards one side or the other while the game may be trying to keep that back and forth going.<br/><br/>Therefore, I feel that there might be another axis in play whereby the game can either be this very interactive thing or it can almost be a kind of solitary puzzle. And I think that a majority of new designs go for the interactive end of the spectrum where you dice the clouds to cloud the dice so that everything is shareable and playable. On the other hand, I feel that a lot of people prefer something on the puzzle side of the spectrum where they can do their symmetry on their own and eventually share some content and play it with the rest of the group.<br/><br/>An example of this puzzle-like approach: let's say I've got this cloud-thing I've been thinking about and that I show just a little bit to you. If the game tells me to ask the question "This happens, so what does your character do?", you might be able to mess directly with my cloud-thing before I'm comfortable with what I've got. If instead I ask something like "What would you like to do?", I can filter your intent through what I've been thinking about for my cloud-thing without messing too much with it.<br/>And this example may be not just about my preference. Maybe you don't know what to say if I ask you what your character does, maybe you don't feel comfortable messing with cloudy stuff right now in front of everybody.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm the kind of gamer who loves interactivity turned up to eleven, so this is just the vibes I get from different people I play with. Maybe I can be a little more clear:<br/><br/>On one end of the spectrum, mostly everybody goes left or everybody goes right. Together. I can tell you about my cloud-thing, ask you a question about yours and you come back to me on the same side. It's a direct conversation.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum, players spread themselves left and right thinking about their own thing. I can tell you about my cloud-thing, ask what you want to do and you come back to me from the other side saying that you do this dice-thing. It's a parallel conversation.<br/><br/>I also drew this, perhaps it's helpful:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/7mT3a3P.jpg"/><br/><br/>Vincent has answered saying:\n<blockquote>Now, this second axis, more interactive to more solitary, sure, okay. Granted that some games are more interactive, some more solitary, and maybe some people have a preference between them, what next?</blockquote>\nI don't know, I lean very heavily towards interactivity, so I'm not sure what to say about the other side of things. If we define roleplaying as a conversation, maybe it's also one that you have with yourself? Maybe there are several Shared Imaginary Spaces in play and not just one.<br/><br/>What does this mean in terms of game design? Make mini-games that indirectly play off each other?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448622/#Comment_448622" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-18T09:08:17+00:00" title="September 18, 2015  9:08AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2015 10:05AM by Rickard.">edited September 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Ricardo">@Ricardo</a> Tavares: When you play is it one story with several characters or one story per character?

In D&amp;D, well, there are a thousand D&amp;D-ways, but I do believe it's common for the DM to make a story out of which the players make their own in their minds for each of their characters. Notice how in Polaris you play relating yourself directly to some shared fictional content while in D&amp;D you may only get to express some statement of intent that the DM then relates to some fictional content that he controls.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
