And well on into the book she tells of a conversation with a friend, writer Jim White:\n<ul>"One day after we knew each other a while--Jim was ten years older than I, a veteran poet--he turned to me. 'Who gave you permission to be a poet? Was it Allen Ginsberg?' I had studied with Ginsberg the summer before. 'Someone along the way has to give you permission'<br/><br/>"'No.' I shook my head. I was too shy to say, 'No, Jim, it was you."</ul>\nAnd then later she breaks it down:\n<ul>"...there's someone further along on the path, who gives you the nod, who says yes, who adores literature as much as you and so gives you permission to love this odd thing all the way..."<br/><br/>"When I say 'you ask permission,' I do not mean you have to go to someone higher up on the totem pole and inquire, Is it okay if I write?...As a matter of fact, never ask anyone...it is about relationship. You know another writer and this reinforces your own love and commitment....It's more like you stand shoulder to shoulder, looking out at the vista, and the older writer points and says, 'See,' and you nod and smile, knowing that the vista is good and sweet and you always want it in front of you."</ul>\nSo what she's describing isn't so much about permission, per se, or mentorship, as it is being treated as a friend and an equal by someone who went there first, right? So, who gave you <em>permission</em> to design games? <br/><br/>For me, it's Ron, absolutely. (Via phone conversations. But I bet he's done it for others through the Sorcerer mini-supplement program. Which brings up another interesting question: do the design community's social institutions, like game design competitions, mini-supplement programs, open game licenses, Dreamation Game Design Roundtables, The Forge Booth, and The Ashcan Front give equivalent <em>permission</em>? Or not?)<br/><br/>Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_72251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72251/#Comment_72251" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T19:43:16+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  7:43PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gary Gygax when he told me to bend or break the rules if they didn't work for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72253">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72253/#Comment_72253" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-28T19:51:42+00:00" title="May 28, 2007  7:51PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I know who, but I think I won't tell. ^_^</p>\n<p>I don't think that the pubishing community (I feel like "design community" is a laughable misnomer) is doing at all the same kind of permission.

These guys were completists, having most every book for an insanely complicated system, but for all that, they had complete ownership of the game, cheerfully and aggressively retooling vast swaths of it to make it into the rukes that helped them play the game they wanted.  Same group managed to start at Phoenix Command and end with something that looked like a John Woo movie, long before Feng Shui had crossed any of their radars.  To call what they did drifting is a painful understatement, but the underlying lesson of the game as servant of the end goal meant that I promptly went forward and applied it to every subsequent game I played. To be completely frank, the line between corrupting a game into a homebrew and creating a new game is, so far as I'm concerned, mostly just a matter of degree.<br><br>-Rob D.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72336/#Comment_72336" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-29T07:37:37+00:00" title="May 29, 2007  7:37AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gave me <i>what?</i> <b>Gave?</b><br/><br/>I am reminded of a Klingon Programmer quote:<br/>"What is this talk of 'release'?

That's not something that just happens because people want it to, because they want to include someone.  It involves a general recognition of someone as "a game designer" when before they were merely someone involved in the game design community.  Sometimes it's accompanied by a different type of social treatment too, I think.<br/><br/>The closest I've come to that, I think, is having former work of mine mentioned in <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> and <i>Agon</i>.  But I don't feel like "a game designer" yet and, honestly, that's stopped bothering me as much as it once did.  I'm enjoying just being a guy who writes about games and does some design stuff on the side.  I'm happy just being a player, a fan, and a commentator, at least for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72666">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince" title="JJ Prince"><img alt="JJ Prince" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com/images/minis/tinyGP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JJ%20Prince">JJ Prince</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72666/#Comment_72666" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T10:03:18+00:00" title="May 30, 2007 10:03AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Paul, good thread.<br/><br/>For me it was Ron on <i>Contenders</i> and Clinton on <i>Swansong</i>.

For me, there's been several phases of my 'gaming life'. The first phase, the beginner, the two to give me permission or inspiration would be James Ward and Jeff Butler, of <i>Gamma World </i>fame and a comics and TSR artist, respectively. Although the game I was working on publishing back then was never really playtested or published, I enjoyed phone conversations with them about gaming hugely.<br><br>The second phase, the 'punk', would have been Christopher Clark from Inner City games, and the two west coast punk rockers that published <i>Die, Conservative, Die!</i> and <i>Brains - Hardcore Punks Against Dead Guys</i>. The three games I designed during that period were tested and played extensively, but never published.<br><br>The third phase, the 'Forge', was Ron Edwards, Tony Lee (author of <i>Extreme Vengeance</i>), and Jared Sorenson. Both of the games I designed and played were published online and even tho the games aren't online anymore, I got a lot of positive feedback from a lot of folks on the interweb.<br><br>These days I'm in a personal phase. I fiddle with games to play them with my young nephew, or come up with a stripped down version of d20 to play with my old gaming group in Madison. I also kick around the idea of digging up my two Forge-era games and re-writing them so people have access to them - I get a couple e-mails or PM's a year for Dead Meat.<br><br>(Oh, and a big "Howdy" to Mike and Paul. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> )                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_72793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/72793/#Comment_72793" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-30T21:36:51+00:00" title="May 30, 2007  9:36PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Back in the day, I participated in a dial-up BBS.

LOL. I've been living up in the northwoods for a few years now, didn't have net access the first couple years - lived in a wood heated cottage. Just recently getting interested in game design again and dusting off Dead Meat and 2PAM and getting them back online.<br><br>As soon as I posted to the question about Dead Meat, I thought "I wonder if Holmes has a copy of Geek Season?". You can post it to Paul's site, please send me a copy when you get a chance too. unodiablobrew AT yahoo DOT com.<br><br>As far as my chain of permission goes, it was mostly what I was into at any given time. James Ward was a pretty cool guy when I met him at a Gen Con and I have been Gamma World Crazy since I was 13. Jeff Butler was my dream artist for the sci fi sports RPG I was working on (from his work on The Badger comic), and would yack with me on the phone for 30-45 minutes of his workday several times. <br><br>The punk phase was because Clark was so damn nice at Gen Con's, and the crazy violent parody of D&amp;D, 'Inner City', needed a lot of house rules to work, which resulted in a ruleset I wrote called Urban Terror. The West Coast duo gave me games I could play with my punk rock friends in exchange for zines or records or tapes, and ideas for some simple games I could make that they would play.<br/><br/>The Forge phase was because talking with all the nuts on GO back in the day was so fun. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Meeting and playing with said nuts at GenCon even more so. I kinda miss going to GenCon...                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73208">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73208/#Comment_73208" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-01T12:48:41+00:00" title="June  1, 2007 12:48PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Permission is a dumb term and is going to be willfully misread by haters.

at all? Um...I suppose Dragon magazine. If anybody did. I'm not sure whether we were home-brewing before or after i discovered Dragon.<br/><br/>To do "real game design"? Either Jennifer Hartshorn, James Wallis, or Christian Moore. Jennifer took me seriously when I said I knew how to do it better (or words to that effect), and offered me my first professional writing gig, doing a bit for the Wraith Players' Guide. James took me seriously as a [potential] RPG designer, and treated me as an equal and friend when we communicated, rather than just a fanboy spouting off at the mouth. Christian also took me seriously, treating me the same as the high rollers (to the degree that such a thing exists in the RPG world) and established designers he was dealing with. I can't tell you in which order those three occurred. Well, i guess i could track down the release dates of Aria and Wraith, and thus date those two, roughly. Can't remember whether I started chatting with James Wallis later or earlier, though.<br/><br/>James is the person i sent a 'thank-you' copy of Dread to, when it finally got published, however. If Ogalepihcra ever gets published, Christian will be getting a comp copy.<br/><br/>Though, really, i'm skeptical of the truth of this concept. Or, rather, as someone else said upthread, if it *is* universally true, then perhaps my parents deserve the real credit. Maybe some personality types need that extra bit of "permission"/encouragement, while others don't--just like introverts need sort of social permission to meet new people while extroverts just do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73857">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73857/#Comment_73857" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T14:04:43+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  2:04PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt; 'Who gave you permission to be a poet?'<br/>&gt; 'So, who gave you permission to design games?'<br/><br/>Sigh.  I'm afraid this might come off pedantic and uncharitable and pointless nitpicking, but there's nothing for it.  Just know I write this because I think it's important and has some value.<br/><br/>The first question is an issue of <i>identity</i>.  It's about who someone is.<br/>The second question is an issue of <i>activity</i>.  It's about what someone does.<br/><br/>I've written poetry, and I've designed games, but I don't think of myself as a poet nor a game designer.  Maybe it's a permission issue, maybe not; it's not something I've really dwelt on, although perhaps it'd do me some good.<br/><br/>All I know is that I've not yet been issued my artistic license.<br/><br/>I will say I am a gamer, though.  Who that comes from... I'm not sure.  It feels like it isn't this ray-of-sunlight, moment-in-time threshold, though.  It feels more like there's an intermittent dew of permission issuing forth from many people, to various degrees, across countless moments.<br/><br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>Roger                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_73859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73859/#Comment_73859" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-05T14:13:14+00:00" title="June  5, 2007  2:13PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nobody ever did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson" title="Ben_Johnson"><img alt="Ben_Johnson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2283/2131054135_2403ed15ce_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Johnson">Ben_Johnson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74113/#Comment_74113" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-06T17:24:34+00:00" title="June  6, 2007  5:24PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monte Cook.<br/>\n<br/>\nI first attended GenCon when I was 17, and I was a big PlaneScape fan, which was the setting Monte was working on at the time. I signed up for every PlaneScape event that still had an opening. Monte ran quite a few of them. I introduced myself, and he recognized me from the PlaneScape message boards on AOL.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Oh, you're [screenname]? You're one of the good ones. You have good ideas," he said.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's when I started to think that I might actually be able to make games. Fast forward a couple of years and I'm going to grad school and getting an internship at Maxis to work on Sims 2, and a few years after that I'm designing games professionally.<br/>\n<br/>\nwalk slow<br/>\nBen                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3168/who-gave-you-permission-to-design-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3168/who-gave-you-permission-to-design-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/3168/who-gave-you-permission-to-design-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F3168%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F3168%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
