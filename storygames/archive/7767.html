One can easily do other things at the same time, or more or less at the same time (chat to friends, listen to music, etc.)<br/><br/>Playing basketball with friends in the park is probably a medium-focus activity, depending on how seriously you compete with each other. Carrying out a conversation at the same time, listening to music and so on is generally possible, but investing in them too heavily will significantly detract from your basketball play (in that you will be easily bested by a player focusing more of their attention on playing basketball). Driving is probably also medium-focus, depending on how familiar you are with the journey, the vehicle and other circumstances.<br/><br/>High-focus activities demand most or all of your attention and suffer significantly if you try to shift focus to something else before they are complete. An actor on a stage needs a high level of focus. High-focus activities inhibit socialisation at the same time.<br/><br/>Here's where it comes back to roleplaying: I think roleplaying is often viewed as a high focus activity. Players are, in some cases, encouraged to:<br/><br/> pay attention<br/> always speak in character<br/> not respond to events witnessed out of character<br/> not read, surf the Internet, etcetera at the table<br/> not talk while others are talking <br/> avoid Monty Python quotes<br/> generally restrict talk to matter directly related to the game<br/> and so on<br/> <br/>But these are all rather unnatural rules for a group which is fundamentally engaged in group social interaction, which is what roleplaying games are a form of. And I think roleplayers trying to operate under such rules find it a continual struggle to stick to them and enforce them for the very reason that they feel unnatural. Ever had that GM who barked at you whenever you spoke out of character? Or has to deal with a LARP or similar where OOC chat was only permitted in certain areas or via a certain set of actions? This is the kind of thing I mean.<br/><br/>However, many people comment (some in the social footprint thread) that they feel a high level of focus is actually <i>necessary</i> for roleplaying to succeed. Some of this is to do with the whole immersion bugbear, but there's other aspects to it as well - one's ability to interact meaningfully with the fiction is dependent on one's awareness of its content, which is compromised by paying only scant attention. And that's just one example.<br/><br/>So, what do people think? Is high-focus necessary for roleplaying? Can low-focus be equally rewarding, or are there ways it will always be inferior? Is high focus unhealthy for the socialisation of the group? Is low focus unhealthy for the enjoyment of the fiction? Can a happy medium be found?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172279/#Comment_172279" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T07:52:24+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  7:52AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As one of the people who is concerned with this, my experience suggests not that low-focus is impossible or inherently unrewarding, but that it isn't rewarding in itself. To put it bluntly, you can either play with intent and get the rewards of play (but lose some of the social benefit), or you can play casually, and get the rewards of the social interaction at the cost of rewarding play.<br/><br/>This is the great "Cheetoism" divide in a nutshell. Is the fictional content of the game a reward in itself, or is the game merely a lubricant for social reward? In my mind, anyway, one of the distinguishing characteristics of This Thing We Do is that the fictional content is important in a way it isn't for other kinds of game/interaction. To the degree that it isn't, I don't see any strong reason to choose playing a story game over any one of dozens of lower-entry-cost activities - or simply direct, unmediated social interaction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172286/#Comment_172286" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T08:09:02+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  8:09AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>To the degree that it isn't, I don't see any strong reason to choose playing a story game over any one of dozens of lower-entry-cost activities - or simply direct, unmediated social interaction.</blockquote>\nI do.

Maybe I just run with the wrong crowd. To address Max's point, yeah, that's exactly it. Although I tend to find that games that are closer to the "toy" end of the spectrum work <b>way</b> better than anything that has winners &amp; losers or meaningful strategy. Actual "game" games tend to turn off a fair number of people - I know a <b>lot</b> of people who really dislike competitive games, or just feel uncomfortably pressured by them.<br/><br/>To give a concrete example: in my social circles, there is a very stark (and not too friendly) divide between the people who like "American" vs "Euro" boardgames. The reasoning is usually something along the lines of "games should be a challenge" vs "games should be fun". Most of my friends are on the "fun" side, and I usually lurk there too. While I can appreciate the elegance of a good Eurogame, give me something colorfully themed and with high toy quality and we'll laugh over it for a few hours, whereas the elegant game will create 2 hours of silence punctuated by expletives. Both of which are fun in their own way, but only one is really social.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172335/#Comment_172335" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T09:53:10+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  9:53AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Thomas,<br/><br/>In the game's I've been playing, everyone is very focused. But they are focused on the fictional aspects of the game and pushing forward with the fiction.<br/><br/>Nothing on the list you provided is either a tool to accomplish that (speaking only in character for example,) or is a problem that needs to be admonished (surfing the internet, for example).<br/><br/>My <i>guess</i> is that we spend a lot of time front-loading play during character creation and grow the game out of that.  For example, on Sunday, we got together to create character for our Traveller game.  We won't start play till the next session.  The guys are still hammering out details about their characters.  And I, as GM, whipped up a subsector map and history of the subsector using the bits of fiction the Players had created  for their characters' pasts.  I'm using the rules for <i>Sorcerer &amp; Sword</i>, and the PCs Kickers, Prices, and Past details were the springwell of the game environment.  (I'll be posting the PCs and the subsector information on my Traveller thread as soon as the Players are done with the characters to show the process.)<br/><br/>When we play, all that work will mean that the game will be about the Player Characters and the issues and ideas the Players cared about.<br/><br/>In my experience the focus this produces is always very focused.  Playful and fun and with a lot of laughter, but always <i>very</i> focused on the game.  People are always tossing out new ideas and creative bits of business -- for themselves and offering suggestions to others.  There's never a need to "keep anyone in line" -- ever.<br/><br/>It is my firm belief that by making sure you really allow Players to sort through and create characters that are about things the Players care about or are excited about, and then <i>use</i> that material to create setting and situation for the PCs to reveal those thing the Players care about and are excited about, everyone stays focused.  Even if they are not onscreen, if Player A is getting to play a scene that excites him and engages him -- really engages him -- he will be entertaining and fun and Players B and C will be engaged as audience members.  This, at least, has been my experience.<br/><br/>By contrast, whenever I play in games where the Players have what amounts to random PCs wandering through environments that have no particular meaning to them, the jokes start up, the surfing starts, the frustration begins.  Because, in my view, it really all comes down to being frustrated.  The Players who need to be told to speak only in character or discuss what their character saw are no different than bored students who are being admonished by a teacher to "Sit up straight!"  The behavior the teacher wants is a means of checking to see if the student is "still present" -- because clearly the student would rather not be.<br/><br/>I don't think "focus" is, in and of itself, a problem at all for Social Footprint.  If people are <i>engaged</i> then they're engaged.  The time passes.  People are having fun.  It's all good.<br/><br/>However, if one is asked to stay focused on an activity that is not inherently engaging it <i>will</i> feel like a time-suck.  So, if the question is, "Does spending your time doing something socially that you're not really engaged in cause trouble?" I'd say yes.  I'd add, from stories I hear about all the time, I'm amazed people keep putting up with it.<br/><br/>I'll add to that:  I know why they keep putting up with it.  Because they know RPGs are cool and keeping wanting the coolness they know on some level they can or have delivered.  I just wish folks could stumble across the games/tools/techniques to help them get that play.  Because talking in character or only using IC knowledge ain't going to make that happen.<br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chearns" title="chearns"><img alt="chearns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chearns">chearns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172371/#Comment_172371" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T11:29:48+00:00" title="October  1, 2008 11:29AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meserach</cite>So, what do people think?

(oooooh I'm going to go to hell for that one!)<br/>\n<br/>\nThe one thing on your list that sits as out of place to me is the 'speaking in character' one. I haven't actually been at a table EVER where people have been pressured to speak in character. At our table we have first person speakers (me), second person speakers and third person speakers and its just part of the game. We get the same intensity of play, but everyone is comfortable with what they are doing.<br/>\n<br/>\nLike so many things, roleplaying is defined by its context. As I said in your other thread, you can change some of the contexts, but if you get rid of them all, you essentially change the original beyond recognition.<br/>\n<br/>\nNeil                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_172510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172510/#Comment_172510" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-01T21:53:48+00:00" title="October  1, 2008  9:53PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2008 10:06PM by JDCorley.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Neil Gow</cite>If you want your game to even slightly resemble polite society, then no, we won't be talking over each other like children in a playground.<br>If not, LARP.</br></blockquote>\nYou say children on a playground, I say normal adults at a normal, large social gathering.<br><br>OH SHI                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_172519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/172519/#Comment_172519" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-02T01:16:12+00:00" title="October  2, 2008  1:16AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find our D&amp;D 4E to be a medium focus game. Which in some ways has made it more relaxed and social. It's fun and I feel like I'm paling around with friends more than immersing in the fictional drama. It also allows us to switch out players with no consequence and even have characters that are played by different players every session. The low barrier to entry has kept the game running for over 10 sessions now. <br><br>But I miss the high focus of many RPGs. It flexes different mental muscles. It may not even be as fun in that it can feel more like work, but it is highly rewarding work. <br><br>I need both.<br><br>I play with quite a few non gamers and I will say that focus is an issue. People are often shocked that it isn't cool to talk on the phone, read a book, or play video games during a game. But on the other hand, with games with very long tactical combat, I can't blame them. If it takes 20-30 minutes before it is my turn again for me to have 5 minutes of fun, that's quite a bit of focus to ask from someone. <br><br>In our smaller groups (3-4 people) where you do something at least every 5 minutes, attaining high focus is much easier.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
