Although I do still think of Agents Hunter and Ranger as being senior to me, as they had both dropped for one mission before I had my first blue drop.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn these five drops I\u2019ve noticed some very unsettling things.<br/>\n<br/>\nA typical \u201cdrop\u201d goes something like this, in my experience. We are contacted by HQ and called in to handle a Hostile Persona. We are given a briefing and some strange and supposedly helpful clues (including at one point a crossword puzzle, a drawing of a spiderweb, a completely blank journal, a wooden box of marbles and on one memorable occasion a set of very large laminated maps of a shopping mall and a collection of handkerchiefs). Then we are introduced to our Control for the drop, head on in to the slab, and make our drop into Blue City.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith one exception. In one game, we started thinking we were all off the slab, at a restaurant outside of the Company building. We only clued in that we had dropped already and somehow had forgotten our briefing when the menus arrived and none of us could read them. Static started building up at a painful rate.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe jobs are pretty simple \u2013 figure out who the Hostile Persona is, isolate, immobilize, get the persona to make a physical appearance, and then dump that bug-like sucker right into the Lacuna and then get the hell off the slab and get back to the real world. But the problem isn\u2019t getting the job done. The problem is getting the job done when a number of the agents on the job have no intention of getting it done. Allow me to elaborate:<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is relatively well-known that Mystery Agent Miner has gone AWOL within Blue City. This puts a lot of the agents he has trained over the years under extra scrutiny on the assumption that they may know why he went AWOL, and perhaps what he is doing in Blue City. My own trainer has contacted me on two occasions to keep an eye on some of Miner\u2019s former colleagues and trainees who have been on drops with me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>My analysis as a player is that because character creation in Lacuna is so random and almost completely lacks any form of background, you tend to latch on to whatever tiny elements you can get your hands on. Many of us have taken to playing our mystery agents based on the name we were assigned. So when your trainer suddenly appears during the game, especially at a very high tension moment in the game, the tendency is to grab hold and try to leverage it so you don\u2019t feel like you are drowning anymore. And in our games, Agent Miner has shown up a few times when the static in the game is over the top \u2013 in the 25+ range \u2013 times of extreme stress, confusion and chaos.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that it appears that some of Miner\u2019s trainees have taken to working against our mission parameters, subtly increasing mission static until we have very little contact with Control, and then actively looking to make contact with Miner.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut our quests for an identity beyond that of our assigned names and assigned trainers leads to other strange behaviour while on the slab and in Blue City.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne mystery agent has developed an obsession with the spidermen and wants to find out what they want with us, which is unhealthy for the successful completion of our mission objectives. Like Agent Miner, spidermen seem to appear when the static is high. Worse, static gets higher whenever they are around. Even worse? Static seems to skyrocket when agents try to interact with them.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd finally, one agent has gone in so deep that he feels that his cover persona in the City is his real persona, and he doesn\u2019t want to leave the slab \u2013 he\u2019s starting a whole movement of agents he\u2019s calling the Ciphers (named after the character from the Matrix) who want to remain on the slab instead of in the real world. And I am beginning to understand him. His particular skills involve deep cover abilities \u2013 he knows more about his life in Blue City than he does his life in the real world. In Blue City he\u2019s married and has a regular job.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223590/#Comment_223590" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-09T21:22:07+00:00" title="August  9, 2009  9:22PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds pretty awesome.
