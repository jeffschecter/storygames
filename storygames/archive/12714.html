You feel it\u2019s eyes on you. You fight against it, but you can\u2019t struggle forever. Soon, it will come for you.<br/><br/>What will you do?</i><br/><br/>Annalise is a game that creates tales of Gothic horror. You and your friends take on the roles of the objects of a dark creature\u2019s desire. Over the course of play you determine the nature of the Vampire - and then you find out what happens when you finally confront the darkness.<br/><br/>You play the hunters, lovers and servants of a Vampire.

Every player has a protagonist character.<br/>-&gt; Satisfying. The rules of the game create Gothic horror fiction.<br/>-&gt; Annalise\u2019s Journal, a 24-page illustrated short story dripping with atmosphere.<br/>-&gt; Six ready-to-play Guided Play Scenarios showcasing the diversity of the game.<br/>-&gt; Works well for 2, 3 or 4 players and takes between 1 and 6 sessions to play.<br/><br/><strong>What Others Are Saying:</strong><br/><br/><i>Since my first Annalise campaign, it\u2019s consistently been one of my top three favorite RPGs (along with Tribe 8 and Blue Planet), and it\u2019s the only one that\u2019s my favorite because of the mechanics rather than the setting.</i><br/>- K. Wyler, player<br/><br/><i>What else can I say, other than this edition reads easily, references itself quickly and looks beautiful? Annalise exemplifies how RPGs should present themselves and how they should organize the information contained within their highly sculpted pages.</i><br/>- Geekbuffet Review - <a href="http://geekbuffet.wordpress.com/2010/07/28/annalise-the-vampire-rpg-youve-been-dying-to-meet/" rel="nofollow">Click here to read the review.</a><br/><br/><i>Annalise is a mature and subtle game.

I played it a little out of the Interim Edition, but this year I got to play a single session pick-up game that was pure awesome.<br/><br/>The claims alone are brilliant. Not only do they ensure a consistent backdrop for the events of the game, they help keep players interested when it's not their scene, and the whole process provides instant feedback on how grabby and evocative your descriptions are.<br/><br/>The way this game builds, and the inevitable release during the Confrontation phase is just awesome. And having all those scenarios right there lets you throw down with a game already in motion, pushing towards the end-game spiral.  I'd really recommend running through one of those first, as knowing first-hand what's coming in the final phases adds weight and intensity to the earlier building segments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286111/#Comment_286111" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T11:02:46+00:00" title="August 13, 2010 11:02AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Arnold!

You can't stop me.<br/><br/>Annalise is a great two-player game. Find a friend, make stories. It's that easy. <br/><br/>Claims create foreshadowing of things you didn't know you wanted to foreshadow. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Zero prep! Character generation during play! Start playing as soon as you sit down.<br/><br/>Annalise isn't just about vampires. In fact, it's not even just about horror. It makes a pretty nifty conspiracy game, too. Really, try it and see. Or a police procedural. Want to play out a story about a creepy serial killer who turns out to be stalking one of the police officers? Or a story like Dexter (from the point of view of his coworkers)? Play Annalise.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286219/#Comment_286219" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-13T16:05:58+00:00" title="August 13, 2010  4:05PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To answer a whisper: I will have a print+pdf option, but ran out of time to make it live earlier this week.
