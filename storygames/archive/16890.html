(We played a previous short game that went great, but it was a miniseries so we didn't flesh out much past the immediate needs of the story). <br/><br/>I'm specifically looking for a PDF so I can share it with my remote players. There are a ton of awesome resources out there; in fact its a bit daunting digging through them all. Has anyone found any yearbooks they made particularly good story-aids? I found some awesome older ones that list all the clubs the kids belonged to next to each picture, or had great student group pages, or student articles, but many of the newer ones are kinda flashy and hard to parse.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
