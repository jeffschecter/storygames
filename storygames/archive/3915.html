Either way, the phrasing was, in fact, sexist.<br/><br/>Most of the "righteous indignation" boiled down to suggestions to talk to the guy, and just let him know that the phrasing made people uncomfortable - since the original poster (Ian Noble, if I recall correctly) <i>stated</i> that it made him uncomfortable.  I know that's what <i>I</i> was advising, at least.<br/><br/>More essentially though, the problem with saying ignorant things like "no bitches at the table" isn't that (gasp!) you might offend someone.  Being offended isn't the end of the world.  The real problem is that it reinforces existing stereotypes and has the potential to negatively impact real people in a real way.<br/><br/>But, you know, the same argument came up back then.

It was a nice little reminder that the world is still very segregated into men vs. women for some people (of both types). I certainly wouldn't support a woman saying "no pigs at the table" either. I think it was actually really interesting to see what a nerve the comment touched. A lot of women have felt excluded by such attitudes, and a lot of men have felt their "them" time attacked. <br/><br/>In general, I think a lot of misogynist attitudes are tolerated in gamer culture (to use a sweeping term) that have been driven out of most other areas of life. A lot of people are willing to give geeks an "uncomfortable around women" pass, but fuck that. It's 2007; being "uncomfortable" around women is just as worthy of derision as being "uncomfortable" around black people. They should grow up and accept that people are more than their chromosomes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson" title="C.W.Richeson"><img alt="C.W.Richeson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/55624463/10865474"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C.W.Richeson">C.W.Richeson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88101/#Comment_88101" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T18:53:11+00:00" title="August 14, 2007  6:53PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 14, 2007 7:03PM by C.W.Richeson.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Edit: and devilmaycare posted a response while I was responding.<br/><br/>Go get 'em devilmaycare.

Enculturation, and all that jazz.<br/><br/>So this dude Bob said this misogynist thing.  Does that make him automatically a horrible evil person?  No, not really.  Does that mean we shouldn't point out what was wrong with this thing that he said?  Equally, no.<br/><br/>By the way, the above is, almost word-for-word, the point that I and at least one other poster were making in that thread.  At least, until people started claiming that sexism (and racism) don't exist any more, and then claimed that any and all links I provided were biased and untrustworthy because they came from "feminist sources."  But, y'know, such is the way of the internet.<br/><br/>Anyway, devilmaycare, I'm sorry to hear that the thread struck such a negative personal chord with you, but it's cool to see you making lemonade out of the lemons, as it were.  Also, I agree completely with what you said about giving people passes for being uncomfortable; of course it's uncomfortable to be confronted with your own prejudices.  All the more reason not to be given a pass.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_88118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/88118/#Comment_88118" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-14T22:28:13+00:00" title="August 14, 2007 10:28PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The disconnect in that thread is pretty obvious, in retrospect. Two things are clear:<br/><br/>1. What Bob said was misogynist, and<br/>2. Bob may be the nicest guy alive. Or not. Nobody knows.<br/><br/>Very, very few people <i>actually</i> implicitly agreed that what Bob said was cool. But a <i>lot</i> of people reacted against the knee-jerk reactions that Bob's misogynist statement necessarily meant that Bob was the Great Satan, since there were a million possible reasons why he said what he said in the way he said it, and we were not given enough context to properly judge Bob. Some of those people responded to the fire-and-brimstone comments against Bob's person by vehemently defending not only him as a person, but also the statement, in an excellent example of Internet message boards communication strategies.<br/><br/>Rinse and repeat for 107 pages.<br/><br/>I figure the way to healing is to provide a statement we can all agree on. I propose "No liches at the table". Damn, all these undead wizards really eat into my human time with my fellow humans.

No more. It's time to break free from those chains, raging assholes! It's time you demanded to be treated like who you are, fellow soul-travelers who deserve the <em>undeniable</em>, <em>inalienable</em> rights of humanity, like the right to freedom, expression, freedom from hostile and negative reactions to your expression, fr33 b00z3 and pr0n. And a pony. Everyone should have a pony.<br/><br/>I mean, if you get cut, do you not bleed? If your hearts are wounded, do you not weep? If White Wolf published another shitty splatbook about some other miscellaneous, yet perfectly <em>vital</em> and <em>important</em> supernatural race, do you not bitch about how they are raping <em>your</em> fandom? If Wizards of the Coast nerfs your favorite <del>exploitable</del> class + yet another class + prestige class + yet another prestige class combination, do you not moan about how nicer things were when D&amp;D was owned by <acronym title="Tactical Something or Other, whatever man">TSR</acronym>, and there was an A in front of your baby, and <acronym title="to hit armor class 0">THAC0</acronym>s roamed the Oearth? If some <em>heartless bastard</em> contradicts your pontifications on the Internet, do you not call him, deservedly so, a twerp who only listens to the side of the <em>filthy</em>, liberal, press and/or the feminist/homosexual agenda, please delete where applicable?<br/><br/>No more hiding, raging assholes. It's time to come out of your basements, out of your mother's homes, and <em>face the world</em>. Tell them you're not afraid to hide any more. Tell them, "Hey, you! My name is \xabinsert your name here\xbb, and I'm a raging asshole! Incidentally, I am also known as \xablist of your sockpuppets and alternate identities\xbb, and I live at \xabplace where you sleep at night\xbb, and I'm no longer afraid! Incidentally, you suck and your mother's a Nazi!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
