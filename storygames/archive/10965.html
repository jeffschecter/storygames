If someone wants to run it via IRC, I will be there (check out <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10236" rel="nofollow"><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a></a>).  But it has me thinking about the kinds of stuff I haven't had a lot of practice doing during my time playing traditional games, mainly coming up with stuff right on the spot and at a critical juncture.<br/><br/>Specifically I'm thinking about the use of Strengths and Weaknesses.  Basically the action comes to a halt and all eyes are on me as I have to come up with off the top of my head a relevant flashback.  But what if I can't think that quickly?  Is there a point where most groups would say, "Hey, give us your flashback already!  I wanna play!" or has it been the experience of people here that it's all right to take some time to scare up an appropriate bit of narration?  What happens if/when total brainlock kicks in?<br/><br/>This could be applied to all sorts of narrative-heavy story games where players are called upon to suddenly pick up where the GM or another player has left off, but I use <i>3:16</i> as an example because that's what I'm reading right now and it seems to be a critical part of the game.  After all, if you're merrily blasting away at those alien bastards and the fun has to stop because someone has a brain fart, well....                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243171/#Comment_243171" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T16:44:05+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  4:44PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 22, 2009 4:45PM by whiteknife.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Meh. Just narrate a really loose flashback. Every time I've played 3:16 I've had super-lazy players.<br/><br/>Flashbacks are just "I used to play soccer so I kick a grenade at them and they all die" and that's it.<br/><br/>I had one person who would, without fail when asked to describe his failed attack say that "his gun jammed". It became sort of a running joke, really.<br/><br/>One of the cool parts about 3:16 is that it's a hell of a lot of fun narratively, but it's still fun if you sit back and mindlessly blast aliens for a while.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that if you can't think of anything good then either ask for suggestions or just say something that's not so great. It's a game, not a play- no one will mind if not every bit of narrative that comes from you is golden or even bronze.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_243174">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243174/#Comment_243174" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T16:55:27+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  4:55PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two things I learned from competitive extemporaneous and impromptu speaking in high school that have served me well in gaming ever since:<br/><br/>1 - You are not as stupid as you think you sound, what you think is terrible is probably not brilliant but it's probably not terrible either.<br/><br/>2 - If you take your time and think about what you're saying, the pause you take is magnified in your own mind 20 or 30 times.

Though Jason is right that the pause probably isn't as long as you think it is while you're thinking, it can be long, and long pauses can kill momentum (I left a house con early once just to get out of a game of Shock: where the player to my left was painfully unable to ever come up with anything).  It's a game, not your magnum opus, so 99% of the time, go  with the most obvious thing or the first thing that sounds basically cool, and don't worry about fiendish amounts of detail or  being super-original.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, maybe, that almost anything you add will potentially spark others' imaginations.  So the bar is really, "is this good enough to keep the game moving and basically fit  the fiction we've established so far?"  The advantage of saying the obvious thing is that it will pretty much always meet that requirement.  And it's likely that your expansion of the fiction will actually be more interesting than you thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243192">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243192/#Comment_243192" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-22T19:23:31+00:00" title="November 22, 2009  7:23PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could also practice, if you're really that nervous about it.<br/><br/>Imagine a 3:16 character; now imagine a situation that character might be in; now imagine a relevant flashback.  Maybe make some notes on it, daydream about it, move some action figures around on your desk, make up the dialogue and do the voices, or whatever works for you.  (You may notice at this point that what you are doing is basically identical to the imaginative play that a little kid does...which is good!  This is <i>how our brains work</i>.)<br/><br/>Now when you're actually playing 3:16 and you have to come up with a relevant flashback, you will either be able to draw upon elements from the little imaginary scenarios you were kicking around earlier, or you will simply be more confident in your ability to invent something on the spot.<br/><br/><br/>And definitely listen to JDCorley's advice above: when you're frozen in the headlights it seems like you're there for hours, but it's really only a few seconds.  No one thinks you're an idiot, they just see you pausing for a brief moment to organize your thoughts.

Can you change the mechanics so I don't have to interact with the other players as much?</blockquote>\nMaybe he was trying to ask you as a GM rather than as a designer.  The fundamental act of all RPG play destroys what the designer intended, desired and/or wrote, and frankly I can easily think of a Houses setup in which interaction between the players-playing-characters is minimized.  (The same way a lot of Amber Diceless games ended up being "three different Amber Diceless games", for example.)  You just have to have the GM be a lot more of a traffic cop, managing the style point economy much more directly than the text suggests.  I see that as a relatively modest change to the game. Of course it produces massive changes in play, but I assume that's what someone who asked a question like that would want.<br/><br/>Similarly, I see this thread more as questioning how to use the tool of the game to facilitate the play that the person wants, rather than critiquing the game or even desiring that the game have been written in some other way. After all, in a parallel universe where the game was different, the OP was entitled "[31:6] What if I want to speed things up?" and Wohn Jick posted about his Blood of the Houses game about which someone asked "How can I interact with the other players more?" There's always someone who is going to want to do something else with the game no matter how the game is written.  Heck, people will accidentally customize a game when they merely misread, misremember or misunderstand, and will high-five a designer or writer for a great game experience that is completely unrecognizable and sounds awful.<br/><br/>At some point, sure, you say, "no, the pacing mechanism is too much a part of 3:16 to change without screwing other things up that I really want".  That's how I came to be about D&amp;D healing after many years of kicking at the concept of hit points in various ways.  Eventually I just said "ya know, this mechanic goes through so much of the game in so many ways and places, either I play it more or less how it's written or I have to do so much rewriting that it's not worth it".  Meanwhile in a parallel universe, CJDorley happily rewrote the hit point mechanics from top to bottom because to her, it was absolutely worth all that effort and the benefit far outweighed the energy and attention expended to get it.<br/><br/>Each individual gamer is going to have a different point beyond which customization is "not worth it."  The designer is just one data point on the curve for that question.  Presumably they designed their game the way they wanted it to be, but that is essentially irrelevant and nobody else in the world has ever cared or will ever care, any more than the designer should care when someone wants to use their game in a way they not only don't intend but find terrible.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is a tangent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker" title="Jim_Crocker"><img alt="Jim_Crocker" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/nEX8WSQ3H0VUJ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jim_Crocker">Jim_Crocker</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244254/#Comment_244254" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-30T11:15:04+00:00" title="November 30, 2009 11:15AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 30, 2009 11:15AM by Jim_Crocker.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "My answer, of course, was, "Fuck off.""<br/><br/>Why did you feel that telling them to "FUCK OFF" was the most appropriate response in that situation (rather, the obvious response, from your 'of course') rather than recommending other games that might suit their play style, or simply saying "Sorry, but no, you should probably try a different game."?<br/><br/>I honestly can't imagine a situation where telling someone to go fuck themselves is a reasonable or appropriate response to an innocent, if perhaps 'silly' (or just ignorant) question.

I agree with you that no matter the hat he might have been wearing, there's no call for that kind of thing.<br/><br/>But Jason is also right that this is a tangent.  John clearly misread the initial post and thought I wanted to do away with the structure of Flashbacks altogether.  That's not the case and I don't think anyone else has made that mistake, so we should probably treat John's post as a blip in the discussion.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, there have been some excellent suggestions and reassurances here, enough so that I'm no longer concerned about my ability to come up with even basic flashbacks on the fly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
