After all, that's the sort of fiction I want it to re-create, so it makes some sense....<br/><br/>Anyway, here it is:<br/><br/>_Dracula_ as a 3-player game of ... and cast no shadow:<br/><br/>At start, P1 creates Harker and Mina.  P2 creates Dracula and a female vampire.  P3 creates a female vampire and Lucy.<br/><br/>P1 chooses Harker as a major character.  P2 chooses Dracula as major.  P3 doesn't choose a major.<br/><br/>Since there's one major vamp and one major victim, both are doubled.<br/><br/>Dracula player chooses Harker as victim (has no other choice!), with goal of making him a Renfield.<br/><br/>Since each player's first scene must be a meeting, play starts with two meetings -- first, Harker meets Dracula (in disguise as his own coachman), then Dracula meets Harker<br/><br/>P3 chooses to create a new minor (allowed once / chapter), and uses up ability to create a minor vampire (allowed once / game).  Third female vampire enters as minor.<br/><br/>First chapter goes into end of chapter for Harker as his Will hits zero, P1 manages to resolve by escaping.  P1 chooses to take another character as a major character -- Mina -- but leaves Harker in play<br/><br/>Tired of playing Dracula, P2 chooses Lucy for a new major.  P3 still doesn't choose a character, making Dracula become a minor character... but Dracula stays doubled!<br/><br/>P3 chooses Lucy as new victim for Dracula, with goal of killing.  <br/><br/>P2 chooses to call on relationships to pass Prowess loss on to minor characters, introduces new minor character of Seward.  (blood transfusions).  P1 decides to help by also creating a new minor -- Godalming.  Third player introduces new minor character -- Van Helsing (can't intro a new vamp!).  Has VH interfere with Lucy's relationships.  Changes goal to turning Lucy into a vampire.<br/><br/>Dracula succeeds in reducing Lucy's Innocence to zero, she becomes a vampire.  This is an end of chapter for Lucy, but P2 chooses to generate vampire version of her and continue playing her.<br/><br/>P3 decides to invoke vampire hunter rule, and make Van Helsing hunt Lucy!<br/><br/>P1, bored with Mina, decides to drop her, but doesn't choose a new major.  Introduces Quincy as a new minor, tying him in retroactively as another suitor of Lucy.<br/><br/>Hunt for Lucy happens.  Lucy is staked and killed, causing another end of chapter.  P2 decides to play Mina again.  P3 chooses to make Van Helsing his major, with new goal of killing D.  P1 still doesn't choose a major, but introduces a new minor -- Renfield, and chooses Mina for D's victim, with goal of turning into a vampire.<br/><br/>P1 alternates playing Dracula, Renfield, and the other vampire hunters, has a lot of fun.  Dracula's Darkness is reduced, by destroying his boxes of earth.<br/><br/>Dracula's Darkness hits zero, which triggers an end of chapter.  P1 decides to make him try to move on, and brings the three other minor vamps in, trying to shunt damage to them.  They're destroyed, then Dracula is destroyed.  Since there are no more vampires, this is end of game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187475">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187475/#Comment_187475" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-10T19:25:56+00:00" title="January 10, 2009  7:25PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Travis!

No GM, and players can switch characters, or... not play them?</blockquote>\nI'm still forming the game at this point, and have written this fictitious "summary of play" to help me in doing so... and you're helping more, so thanks!<br/><br/>Yep, I want it to be GMless.  At the start, each player creates two characters.  They can then choose one as "theirs", in which case that character becomes a major character for the first chapter.  Then the remaining characters get put in the center of the table.  Any player who didn't choose a character can choose one of those.  <br/><br/>A player can also opt not to pick a major character at all.  In that case, they can play minor characters throughout the chapter, switching which minor character they're playing at will.  When a decision has to be made on behalf of a minor character, it's either done by a player who's not playing a major character, or, if there aren't any, it's decided randomly.<br/><br/>My intent is that a player playing no major character will have a semi-GM role, but don't have it fully worked out yet.\n<blockquote>1. What is P3's first scene? Does P3 frame a scene and the other players play Harker and Dracula in it? Does P3 narrate what Harker does when he meets this new female vampire? Can you always just snatch up other players' characters (when P2 starts playing Lucy)?</blockquote>\nThose who picked majors frame scenes first.   P3 then gets to frame one, using one of the minor characters.  Those who have picked majors play those majors for the full chapter.<br/><br/>When a chapter ends, those who have majors have the option to stop playing them (or might *have* to stop -- e.g., if the character was killed).  Once that's done, picking up characters starts from the player whose character went to zero to cause the end of chapter and goes around the table.  Hopefully that's clear enough -- it's almost one AM here right now, so I don't know how coherent I'm being.  :-)\n<blockquote>]2. What if everybody wants to play a vampire? What if nobody wants to play a vampire, either at the start, or because they like the human characters? What happens if 2 players want to play the same character? Why would I not want to choose a major (like P3)?</blockquote>\nI'm planning alternate setups depending on how the initial character selection goes.  For example, the note at the beginning that Dracula and Harker are both doubled because there's only one vampire and one victim -- if P3 had chosen a major at the start, one or the other wouldn't have been doubled.<br/><br/>If everybody picks a vampire, then all the victims are NPCs, and one of them is selected to be doubled.  The game will be an in-fighting sort of thing between the vampires, or a competition to see who can get the victim that's been doubled.<br/><br/>If nobody plays a vampire, then all the vampires are NPCs, and one of them is selected to be doubled.  The doubled vamp is the "master vampire", and that vamp's initial victim will be chosen randomly.  <br/><br/>As noted above, each player gets first crack at the characters they created at the start.  After that, selection goes around the table.<br/><br/>If you don't choose a major for a chapter, you can freely switch between the minor characters.  Also, while it didn't show up in this example, at any point in the chapter, you can pick one of the minor characters as your major.  Players not playing a major also make decisions for the minor characters when those are needed.\n<blockquote>3. Does every chapter end with somebody reduced to 0 (in Will, Innocence, or Darkness?) Is the attack process always between vampires and humans (Dracula vs. Harker, then Dracula vs Lucy, then Van Helsing vs Dracula), or can humans attack each other? Say, what if I wanted to have Dracula command Renfield to kil van Helsing, and have that be the source of drama?</blockquote>\nYes, every chapter ends with someone reduced to 0 in a stat.  The full list of stats is:  for vampires, Beast, Master, and Darkness.  For victims, Prowess, Will, and Innocence.  Victims can attack each other, so yeah, you could have Dracula command Renfield to kill Van Helsing. \n<blockquote>4. So, given the options ...acns offers right now, how could this game of Dracula be different? Could Harker destroy Dracula, then be seduced by P3's female vampire? Could Lucy beat Van Helsing, then turn Mina into a vampire? Could she Duke it out with Dracula after he has turned her into a vampire?</blockquote>\nYes, all of those would be possible.  :-)\n<blockquote>5. Put up a link to your ...acns blog.</blockquote>\nSure!

I played V:TM; I haven't played or read V:TR because I didn't really like V:TM very much.  ...acns isn't intended for an Anne Rice-sort of thing; it would be possible to stretch it for that, but I prefer to focus it on vampires as villains, as in Dracula, Carmilla, etc.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that redemption for a vampire should be very difficult.  To drive this, vampires have Needs -- Thirst, Desire, and Loneliness.  Using their abilities causes their Needs to increase.  Needs can be reduced by feeding off of victims; they can also be Shunted, which converts one Need to another, but at the cost of increasing the level.  (This comes in, for example, if you're trying to play a vampire like Edward Cullen in Twilight -- he shunts his Thirst and Desire into Loneliness, then uses Bella to "feed", reducing his Loneliness.)<br/><br/>I do plan to have ways for a vampire to destroy itself, become human, or choose to "move on", removing itself from the situation it's in and the set of ties it has acquired.  Any of those could be a means of "redemption".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/efindel" title="efindel"><img alt="efindel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/efindel">efindel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187556/#Comment_187556" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-11T09:07:57+00:00" title="January 11, 2009  9:07AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tracked down Annalise on Google this morning, read a couple of reviews, and found the actual site for the game itself.  Interesting.  <br/><br/>From the description, no one actually plays a vampire in Annalise, which would put it as corresponding to the case in ...acns where everyone chooses to play a victim.  That makes one major difference already -- in ...acns, you may have a mix of vampires and victims being played, all the way up to the possibility that everyone plays a vampire.<br/><br/>I'd seen passing references to Annalise before, but not with enough description for me to realize that it is a vampire game.  I've ordered it to take a look at.  Thanks!<br/><br/>Speaking of other vampire games, though, the one that really sparked me originally to start working on ...acns is Lumpley's unfinished game Hungry, Desperate, and Alone.
