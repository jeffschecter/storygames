Who wants to go get who? <br/><br/>2) An NPC you have relationship dice with has some reason to speak to you (or vice versa), and how intimate do you want the scene to be? <br/><br/>Example: Your Aunt Prudence asks you to come by later, as she's some family business she needs to talk to you about. <br/><br/>Example 2: That cute and marriageable Brother Thomas often goes out walking by Tailor Creek at sunset, which might be a good time to talk to him about his sister and maybe get some relationship dice... do you want all the Dogs to come with you? <br/><br/>3) Got sin of your own? Want the other Dogs to see it? <br/><br/>Example: Brother Milverton is drinking, you know it, because you drink/your dad drank, and when you confront him without evidence do you want the other Dogs there to find out about your problems? <br/><br/>4) Sometimes you don't want to intimidate the witness.  <br/><br/>Example: The Steward says that Brother Clarence may be ready to confess, but he's nervous and having all five dogs storm in on him may freak him and make him bolt or shoot. It may be best if one or two Dogs go in to talk, while the others talk with his wife to gather supporting evidence. <br/><br/>Example 2: Brother Shelby really likes one of the Dogs, and wants to be a Dog, but he's painfully shy and afraid of big groups of men with guns (how unreasonable of him!), but if one Dog went in and talked to him alone, he'd probably be all full of interesting information. <br/><br/>5) Gender issues. (Works best if you've got Dogs of different genders, of course.) <br/><br/>Example: Sister Chase is the only female Dog in the group, and everyone thinks its maybe better if she's the one that goes and talks to Sister Elenore about her miscarriage. <br/><br/>I'm sure there are more, those are just the top 5 that popped into my head.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176222/#Comment_176222" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T11:08:15+00:00" title="October 25, 2008 11:08AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In one direction you hear gun shots.

Remember to invite them for dinner and to spend the night; it's a plum honor to feed a Dog, and a crying shame to let a Dog leave your table hungry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176310/#Comment_176310" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-26T07:27:29+00:00" title="October 26, 2008  7:27AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to remember is that everybody knows a gang of Dogs with unity of purpose almost always wins.

You may know all this stuff already, but here it is anyhow.</p>\n<p><strong>Most raises are vs. all the Dogs</strong><br/>\nWhen I Raise as the GM, I make sure my narration encompasses each of the Dogs.  I then expect each player to See or Give against the two dice I laid out.  That helps eat up some of the players' dice and balances things out just a little.</p>\n<p><strong>Pick on one Dog.  Make them want to give.  Repeat.</strong><br/>\nEven while I'm Raising equally against all the Dogs, I like to pick out one who'll get special treatment when I'm Taking the Blow.  That's the Dog who's going to 'accidentally' set granny on fire or knock some teeth out of the smart-mouthed kid.  With a little bit of luck you might be able to get that one player to Give quickly, since you've given him the sense that he's doing more harm than good AND the other Dogs have things under controll.  If you do get one player/Dog to drop out, awesome:  Move that spotlight to someone else who's still in the conflict.</p>\n<p><strong>It's not about win or loss, it's about cost.</strong><br/>\nYou know how it's awesome to ask someone "Hey, are you REALLY going to shoot him??" just before escallation?  You can also ask your players something like:  "Hey, there are FOUR of you here!  Don't you think the four of you can resolve this thing without getting violent?"  Alternately, the next time your group of Dogs gangs up on and bullies some little old lady, play it out, let them win, and then have the Steward and a posse of armed farmers show up and ask the Dogs to leave town (or worse, aplolgise to the person they'd bullied).  "I don't care if the Maker sent you down personally.  No one bullies old ladies in <em>my</em> town."</p>\n<p><strong>Give before it begins</strong><br/>\nI have Given on a conflict after the dice were rolled but before a single Raise was made.  I saw that there was little chance of doing any harm to the Dogs and zero chance of winning.  Since I really didn't care how badly beat up the NPC got, I just gave and let the players describe how they won.  I didn't see any reason to prolong the inevitable and I said so to the players.  If I were in your particular situation, where the players were in the habit of never splitting up, I might have mentioned to the players at that moment that'd it might have been interesting to see how things played out against a single Dog.  Which, I think, might be enough to plant the seed in the players' heads that things are more fun when the Dogs are not united.</p>\n<p><strong>Finally:  Try to split the morality of the players and their Dogs</strong><br/>\nThe Dogs can't be a single unit of destruction when they can't agree on who did wrong or how to solve the problems.  Get subtle and crafty with your town design.  Make sure that there's at least two good, strong sides to each story.  If you can feel sympathetic for each side and you're not sure how you'd resolve the mess, then it's probably a nice situation for dividing the Dogs.  If one situation doesn't split them, don't sweat it.  Just use the information they give you to find some other situation that might split them.  Then, once they're split, put them in a situation where only one side can win and encourage them to go into dice-conflict against each other.  Then you get to sit back and watch.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I hope that's a little helpful.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176412/#Comment_176412" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-27T10:20:25+00:00" title="October 27, 2008 10:20AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ::bows to Eric::                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
