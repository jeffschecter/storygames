It's particularly poignant, because the party has promised (of their own initiative, mind you) to unmake the largest and most corrupt warlord's summer estate within a year, lest they forfeit their immortal souls to the angry wrath of some powerful but bound elemental spirits.<br/><br/>At any rate, I wanted to rejoin the characters two months from where we left them.  All that loot opened some doors, and they all took some... sidetracks along their way.<br/><br/>The game will rejoin them next week, all gathering against the (armed, guarded, and closed) border to the kingdom they need passage into.<br/><br/>But what to do to fill that space?<br/><br/>I took some inspiration from Dread, and made up some surveys that I could hand out.  The rules were: don't even LOOK at question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> until you have answered question <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> completely.  And of course, use an ink pen so there's no backsies.<br/><br/>Here's what I asked them:\n<blockquote>Some of the Yellow Tiger\u2019s treasure was spent at a local festival in Che. Who did you meet there and what information did you get from her?<br/><br/>When she didn\u2019t want money, what did you offer as payment?<br/><br/>After the Yellow Tiger traced his gold, who died misdirecting the auditors?</blockquote>\n--\n<blockquote>Mistress Bailu, a Tiger, surprised you with compassion and generosity What deed made you take notice?<br/><br/>How did you react afterward, when that same tiger judged one of her supplicants harshly?<br/><br/>Assembled at a public dinner later that evening, you were called on to remark on Bailu\u2019s character. How did you relate your opinion, even as the conversations all around hushed themselves and strained to listen?</blockquote>\n--\n<blockquote>Wu Manrui approached you while in the Dong Shen Mountains. A small Pig had run away, one of 9 he was looking after... How did you encounter the child?<br/><br/>After he pled for his freedom, did you make him go back to Manrui's care?<br/><br/>What about his younger brother? Did you free him or just walk away?</blockquote>\n--\n<blockquote>A Taoist peddler hailed you as a servant/savior/saint of water in the market in Dai Xian. Who paid the most unwelcome attention to this claim?<br/><br/>That embarrassment aside, in the next village of Yi, lightning nearly struck you. Instead it split your weapon in half. What did you do with it then?<br/><br/>The most beautiful painting you have ever seen was in a pawn show in Hei Nei. Though you could have paid more, it wasn\u2019t cheap. What did it cost you?<br/><br/>How do you carry it with you?</blockquote>\n--\n<blockquote>When did the nightmares start?<br/><br/>In Miao Xiang, you woke from a dream to find yourself in a very real bar brawl. Who did you make suffer while you made your escape?<br/><br/>A young man traveled with you for several days before mysteriously dying. Who was he?<br/><br/>Why did you never check for cause of death?</blockquote>\n--\n<blockquote>A ginseng wizard met you over a game of chance. How much of your tale did you share with her?<br/><br/>Thinking it was just a conversation and a game, you parted ways and didn\u2019t see her for a few days. Then suddenly she was there in Shang Dang. She insisted you tell her more. What else did you confess?<br/><br/>When she wanted still more, feverishly, what lie did you make up to quell her curiosity?<br/><br/>How much of your fortune do you only today realize she won from you? (She was particularly lucky, after all.)</blockquote>\n--\n<blockquote>A giant of a Wolf blocked your path through the forests East of the Dong Shen. He had heard of your wealth, and your exploits against the \u201cBlue Dragon.\u201d What did he ask of you?<br/><br/>What member of your family did he already kill to prove that he could not take \u201cno\u201d for an answer?<br/><br/>What were the last words you exchanged with that family member, and how did they affect your decision to help the man?<br/><br/>After it was all done, an oracle took a prayer to your deceased and to the giant. What did those two prayers say?</blockquote>\n--\n<blockquote>Money is Powers is Knowledge, and their servants seek them. Old money unlocks old secrets. What have you spent the most money chasing?<br/><br/>Far to the West in the caves bordering a forgotten kingdom there is an ancient Monkey who is said to know every secret there ever was. How much will you need before you journey there? (It is perilous to waste his time!)<br/><br/>A thoughtful birthday present was delivered to you by surprise. Who was it from?<br/><br/>How has it already proved invaluable?</blockquote>\n--<br/><br/>Some of that stuff was targeted at a specific character, but a lot of that was random inspiration.  It helped out a bunch!  It gave people ideas on what to spend their experience on, and helped foster player created goals for chapter two.<br/><br/>Excitement!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_353329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353329/#Comment_353329" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-06T12:54:39+00:00" title="January  6, 2012 12:54PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really awesome, actually.

We had one player who wound up putting in simple answers, that by his own admission, are mostly non-threatening dead-ends.<br/><br/>And I had another idea.  I couldn't work it in organically during the session, so I asked the group afterwards for feedback on the idea and if they wanted to persue it.  As follows:\n<blockquote>Now that the game is back on, let's bring these questions and this back-story to the forefront.  I want to manufacture a scene where the characters are relating some event from the past few months, each in turn, but as a reward for talking it all out in character, I want the character who is narrating to effectively become the GM.  I will react with the opposition and difficulty, and play out any NPCs that need be there, but the dice will decide what happens.  <br/><br/>Effectively, I want to give you each a chance to "ret-con" one of the facts you committed to.  The new outcome of the memory scene will become cannon, and you will have re-written your destiny, so to speak.</blockquote>\nAnd they're behind it.<br/>The character who didn't have much bad happen to him at first thought this wasn't going to work for him.  However, we talked it out, and instead of mitigating something bad, he can use this as an opportunity to add some bonus deed or find some integral clue for the future.<br/>In short, he's still planning to add something to his tale, so he's still bought in to the process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356129/#Comment_356129" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-26T16:58:48+00:00" title="January 26, 2012  4:58PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Update:<br/><br/>It worked, but not as hard as I wanted it to.  We got to add a lot of depth to the scenes that we "re-told" but the players weren't too keen on redifining or challenging the original outcomes.<br/><br/>And since it was the first thing we did in the session (practically) it was a little cold.  But by that I mean honestly a "little" cold.  Good fun.  And everyone at least got to tell what went on to their characters... in character... which spun in to all sorts of in game dialogue.<br/><br/>So yeah, I would do it again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
