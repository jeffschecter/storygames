I decided to change NOTHING about the rules.  They actually fit quite perfectly.  My additions and creation of a (private) PDF for my players was to set the entire game around The Batman with the Minion roles as the many super hero characters of the Bat-Family.  <br/><br/>I've began a simple wiki for our story arc which will include:<br/>-  story recap<br/>-  mini-bio/stats of the PCs<br/>-  PDF of my take on MLwF  (I've removed all the rule pages - go buy MLwM!!)<br/>-  PDF 2 page bio on all the minions for PC choices<br/><br/>You can visit and enjoy that wiki here:  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mylifewiththebatman/" rel="nofollow">MY LIFE WITH THE BATMAN wiki</a><br/><br/>Our group planned the setting of Gotham and built their characters as described in MLwM.  We discussed the game and decided to go with:<br/>FEAR:  5<br/>REASON:  3<br/>The players had nine choices of character to play from the Bat-Family:  Nightwing, Red Robin, Robin III, Oracle, Azrael, Batgril, the Huntress, Spoiler, and Bat-Mite.<br/>They chose:   Nightwing, Robin III, Azrael, the Huntress, and Spoiler.<br/><br/>I was VERY happy with these choices as it got two of the closest minions to The Batman (the Robins) and several "wild cards" of different stripes and personalities (with the others).  They then chose their stats (which I'm adding to our wiki as I remember them).<br/>I'll be completing a story style actual play accounting of the game (that I'm writing slowly on our wiki) which I'll copy here for folks to enjoy.  But to give a quick rundown of events here's the basics.  Some of our players may speak up and join in to tell their experience.  I'll also cover any rule challenges and enjoyments we hit as I remember them.<br/><br/><br/>TRADE PAPERBACK  -  MEANS TO END<br/>issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a><br/><b>Pawns in Play</b><br/>August 28, 2008<br/><br/><br/><b>CREDITS:</b><br/>I like to have fun with cinematic over-the-top openings.  I built a simple slide-show of various images of the Batman world, showing it on my flat-screen TV while playing opening with music theme from the Batman Beyond cartoon followed quickly by the first track (Why so serious) from the Dark Knight soundtrack.  While the music played and images scrolled - I read this to open and set the scene:<br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/>Something shuffles... out of sight. <br/>Something sucks the stale air... and hisses.<br/>Gliding with ancient grace unwilling to retreat as his brothers did, eyes gleaming untouched by love or joy or sorrow.<br/>Breath hot with the taste of fallen foes... the stench of dead things, damned things surely the fiercest survivor the purest warrior.<br/><br/>Crashing through the window of YOUR study\u2026  My study\u2026<br/>I have seen it before... somwhere... it frightened me as a boy.

The Batman stood in the center hammering his fists into the Joker - who was just cackling away.  Robin stood with him watching in horror as blood and teeth fly.  Across on another building Nightwing and Spolier charged toward the master to head his command, chased by canine units of the GCPD.  A police gunship swooped in trying to light them all up with a searchlight.  A half-dozen police units were flooding up the building from below converging on The Batman - who was seething with rage wondering HOW could they be after him with the Joker committing such crimes!<br/>Below on the street Azrael and the Huntress raced away leading the perimeter police cruisers out of the scene.<br/><br/>The Batman's opening order was...   "BAIT!"  <br/>The idea being that all the minions would go into action to distract or otherwise act as bait while their master dealt with the Joker and/or getting away!<br/><br/><b>FIRST ROUND:</b><br/>With the scene framed I opened with each minion describing their action/scene.  This actually turned into a multiple table circling description of each character's actions "panel to panel".  While this was in the style of "only one action" of MLwM, we realized soon that this was actually more like 5-6 mini-adventures in the context of MLwM.  The PCs did 4-6 villainy/violence actions with no chance for Overtures.  This wasn't "bad" and we were having a blast in the heat of the action for FINISH the entire overarching scene of the "main mission"  (which was to allow The Batman to escape with the Joker).  The only problem was the PCs were racking up Self-Loathing without gaining Love so quickly and early.<br/><br/>Ultimately this wasn't that big an issue.  I had began each PC with 3 Love across their two Connections to speed the game to a 1-2 session Endgame anyway.<br/>Overall with loads of super cool action/description and dialogue here's the basics:<br/><br/>Robin - watched as Batman's beating of the Joker caved in the rooftop, and jumped in to save the innocent police officers by putting explosives in key points to drop The Batman alone hopefully avoiding a chaotic crash.  He later swooped down to escape with Batman in the Batmobile.<br/><br/>Nightwing - took out the spotlight on the chopper and then stopped The Batman for making Joker into a pez dispenser with a Batarang (with a tie on the dice trying to throw his own Wingding to disarm Batman from afar).  He then lept in using smoke pellets to confuse the police.  But ultimately stayed after to make sure all the police made it out safe.<br/><br/>Spoiler  -  used the momentum of the chopper jerking up from Nightwing taking out the spotlight to use a grapple line to swing into the lower floor where the Batman and Joker had fallen.  She jumped to intercept the battle to help Joker but failed, the Batman caught her in mid-air by the throat and scolded her - saying she didn't have what it took to fight by his side! "GO HOME!"  She failed the command check and slinked off sobbing into the sewers to find a hidden escape to a Batcave downtown...  leaving Nightwing alone to help save the cops.<br/><br/>Azrael -  leading the police away, watching them dangerously crash into parked cars, etc... he came on a perimeter baracade about five blocks out from the Batman's position.  Seeing the Batmobile (thing tank tumbler from Batman Begins)  needing a "hole" in the baracade to get in for an escape vehicle for Batman - he jumped the baricade using his flaming bastard sword to cut a hole.  Then turning back to Batman's next command of "All hands to me!"  leading the Batmobile to the Batman, chased by the Black and Whites all the way.  He made it back just in time to save the Joker from being street pizza after Batman threw him off the 6th floor as he made his own escape.<br/><br/>Huntress - splitting from Azrael when she saw Joker's gal-pal escaping on her own odd motorcycle, Huntress chased down Harlyquinn and was about to aprehend her when the order to return came in.  Grimacing, she turned and watched as Harely used a boxing glove topped bazooka to make a hole in another police barricade to escape.  Making it back to the Batman she waited to help him escape.  Soon she saw the Joker being thrown out of the building above as the Batman soared down to the Batmobile.  Watching as Azrael saved Joker jumping onto her bike and racing off.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166159/#Comment_166159" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T15:31:52+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  3:31PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2008 8:25PM by kevperrine.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            SECOND SCENE:<br/>These scenes were set for a round of Overtures.  I aloud each player to work in 2 overture scenes since I'd had them do several scenes without any.<br/><br/>Robin -  met with Connor Kent (Superboy) and learned (from Oracle) that Batman was tracking Superman's flight patterns by following his radiation trail, this tracking was being routed through OMAC satellites over the last month using Lex Corp to hide/disguise Batman's tracking.  He also learned that a payload of 5 lbs of Kryptonite had been installed in the OMAC satellite recently!  He later met up with Nightwing to discuss this, along with Conner they went to a game/dance club and relaxed.   [1 love from Connor and 1 from Nightwing]<br/><br/>Nightwing -  concerned with the rising agression of the Batman Nightwing spoke with Oracle (who also informed him of the Tracking of Superman).  He then went to confront Bruce.  Overhearing The Batman talking to someone in Bruce's study, the door was locked and soon Bruce Wayne appeared to usher them off to the Billiard room to talk.  The dual personalities were shown here as Dick was comforted by Bruce but lashed out at by the Batman in quick succession.  Dick then left and met up with Robin.   [1 love from Barb and 1 from Bruce]<br/><br/>Spoiler  -  leaving the roof scene by sewer Stephanie was broken, she found Batgirl in the downtown cave who aided her in the only way she knew... learning new katas and fighting styles... Then later, she decided to sneak up from outside to see the family that had adopted her baby...  failing the Overature check she only heard as the abusive husband lashed out at his wife while the baby lay crying and alone.  [1 love from Batgirl and 1 from her baby]<br/><br/>Azreal  -  needing clensed from the bloody action, he went to confess at his church (St. Andrew's) with Father Flanagan.  In a strange conferssion, Father Flanagan advised that Jean-Paul must "heed the Master"... he meant GOD, but all Azrael heard was "heed the Batman!".  Along with Huntress he helped her capture Harelyquinn who'd gotten away from Huntress before. [1 love from Father Flanagan and 1 from Huntress]<br/><br/>Huntress -  in a fit of frustration at her performance she decided a girls day was needed and went shopping with Black Canary and Oracle, she also heard about the tracking of Superman at this point.  [1 love from Black Canary]<br/><br/><br/>THIRD SCENE:<br/>To wrap up for the night we left on a cliff-hanger with The Batman calling the minions -  DUTY CALLS...  I left each PC with their next command to face at the beginning of next session...<br/><br/>Robin -  Take your camera, pictures of "the boyscout" are needed.  When he arrived at the horrid old hotel, he watched as Gotham's mayor was putting himself in comprimising situations with a young boy while wearing a Superman costume!!  The Batman apparently wants pictures of the scandel.<br/><br/>Nightwing -  His order was to sink a ferry with a dozen dignitaries, make it appear as an accident, make sure Jim Gordon survives and capture a certain ace female reporter from Metropolis... <br/><br/>Spoiler  -  Prove yourself Harlyquinn is a necessary pawn, it was stupid of Azreal to capture her for the police - sneak into Gordon's offices and bust her out of jail - don't get seen.<br/><br/>Azreal  -  Take this micro-dot, go to Metropolis find the Boyscout and tag him with it (secretly)... lead him back to Gotham in any manner possible.<br/><br/>Huntress -  Evacuate the St. Andrew's church and set it as a stage for a "private" reception for the Batman and guest.  In this endeavor, the church itself is expendable<br/><br/><br/><br/>And that's it...<br/>Story of the game coming soon...<br/><br/>I'd love to hear what you think!!<br/><br/>thanks<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166177/#Comment_166177" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T17:26:28+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  5:26PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            omg!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166179/#Comment_166179" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T17:33:54+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  5:33PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Neat stuff.

I like using feedback to know what I'm doing well on, so I can continue doing that type stuff...  heheh...<br/><br/><br/>Graham - Did the players get into the it?  I can't say.  I tend to be overly cinematic and ham-up my opening scenes like that for EVERY game I run.  So the ones that know me probably just glazed their eyes with ... <b> "oh damn, kevin's doing that weird thing again... I wish we could actually PLAY instead of him on a soap-box description mode..."</b>.  heheh... I really don't know.<br/><br/>I know at least one of the players reads/posts here, maybe he'll chime in.<br/><br/>As for the length of the TV being on... I actually left about 4 dozen cool Batman world images looping randomly on-screen after the planned images for the opening.  I noticed about 5 minutes into my handing the scenes over to the players to run with that when they weren't specifically talking or describing their scene - their eyes were watching the still images flip through.  That's strangely natural though - I've always known that you DON'T turn on a TV if you have friends over for social gaming...  If you do, no one will pay attention to anything but the tube.

Batman's what we pay admission to see.<br/>The entire point of my idea and the game I've ran is that The Batman and Bruce are inherently different people in the game.  You never see Bruce putting on the costume.  It's either The Batman or Bruce Wayne.  They don't exist side by side.  The minions all "know" Bruce is Batman, but it's not the topic of the game.  THe idea is that The Batman is this massive figure.  Bruce Wayne's the nice guy father/brother figure....  <br/>Bruce is the weakest part - "My Life with Master" isn't about a weak master.<br/><br/>It just doesn't fit the game planned.<br/><br/>If you don't get that, you likely don't know the origin game My Life with Master.<br/><br/><br/>Why not Alfred?....  Alfred isn't a minion of The Batman following his orders, he's a servant and a psuedo-father/caretaker.  But he's not a minion in the same way minions in My Life with Master are.  And on top of that...  he's not a super hero to go fight crime or be commanded to do so...  What fun would it be to be commanded to go get coffee?<br/><br/><br/>Another idea would be to read some of the info in the PDF I made to get the understanding of my point for the hack of My Life with Master.<br/>-kev-<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166453">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166453/#Comment_166453" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T09:41:12+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  9:41AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When I said "Most of us who have followed this..."

No.<br/>All are fans of Batman in general.  No one is over-eager about it.  Just normal fans.  Only one of the players is really a solid comic fan.  He's into DC comics much more than myself actually.<br/>The others are familiar and read comics now and then, but no real regular readers.<br/><br/>How familiar are they with the characters/setting?...  Not really.<br/>However, if you went to our wiki (link provided above)  I've posted copies of my PDF created for this game.  Please check them out:<br/>-  <b>MY LIFE WITH THE BATMAN - Ruleless.pdf</b> :  this is the PDF without the RULES associated with and written by the author of "My Life with Master",  with respect to the author I tried to take out any of his rules and writting while still giving you folk a copy of what I've compiled for my private play-group.  In this I have many points of background and the ideas behind this play session premise.  Notes on Gotham, Wayne Manor, the Batcaves, how this game plans to handle NPC villains and others (like Alfred), etc...<br/>-  <b>Batmans Minions.pdf</b> :  This is a doc I prepared for each player to have for their character choice.  Each minion has a 2 page info brief on the character with images.  I also created a few key questions to post on RPG message forums to ask and have repliers help me with that would point answers to PC questions for creating stats.  Which the Players did together prior to play.<br/><br/><br/>So... while none had intimate familiarity, they all have a good bio on each character and some key points to answer for role-play purposes.  <br/>Some weren't aware of some of these more obscure characters  (such as Spoiler) until this game.  <br/><br/><br/>Side note...  They ALL are doing an AMAZING-TASTIC JOB at role-playing the presonalities!!  I am a little familiar with all these characters and even though some of the players have never heard of the character they're playing - with the background doc I prepared they've slipped into the role BEAUTIFULLY.  It has actually FELT like a dark and twisted Batman comic!!  No crap.

You see, I am a big Batman fan, and I have a pretty decent knowledge over all of those characters, the setting and stuff. So I'd love to play through it.<br/><br/>Yet I bet my regular group of players only have a decent and common knowledge about the most general things about the setting. I'd even say only a couple of them actually read comics with moderate regularity.<br/><br/>Then I was wondering... How does such a focused setting works with people who are not familiar with it all that much? Does it interferes (or perhaps even helps) with the game? Are they interested in knowing their characters beyond what you have provided? How much do they relate with the mood, the plot and the characters?<br/><br/>It is not that I'm looking to convert people into Batman hardcore fans, but I'm thinking on how their immersion process is working.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166551/#Comment_166551" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T00:11:24+00:00" title="September  2, 2008 12:11AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2008 12:16AM by kevperrine.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For my group thusfar  (mostly not familiar in detail with Batman stuff)  I think its been a fun learning experience.<br/>The bio pages I prepped for the group gave enough info that the players have been able to really sink into the story and character without a hitch.  As I noted, even lesser known characters like Spoiler were played with style and consistency of the comics.<br/><br/>I can't say if it helps... but it hasn't interfered with our group/game.  <br/><br/>I believe the group is interested in the characters ... I think one or two of them looked up info on Wikipedia about who they hoped to play before coming to the session.  The mood and plot has been amazing to watch and participate in with the group I have.  All of them agreed.  At least two said multiple times how they were impressed with the play of the personalities of the characters.  How it felt right...<br/><br/><br/>One thing one player noted was that he was sort of jolted by the sheer darkness I presented with the world.  Here's his email reply on the session... <br/> <br/><b><i>"I was initially put off balance by the psychotic brutality of The Batman. I was expecting a more conventional Batman from you Kevin, <br/>with us the players revealing the rotten center of the candy-coated  image of the Bat Family. I think that could make a good game, but your version was fun too. Certainly it was more focussed and got things off  to a pulse-pounding start. Good Job!"</i></b><br/><br/>so...<br/>What he meant by "expecting a more conventional Batman from" me... was that he knows me as a big fan of 4-color comics, pulpy styles, etc... But what I determined would be fun (for this) would be to really absorb all the flavor of the themes of "My Life with Master" with the darker tones and shine that dark light on The Batman.<br/>I specifically never "showed" The Batman killing anyone... but it was heavily hinted that he'd gone off his rocker and is willing to "make sacrifices" for the cause...  In fact in an AWESOME "overture" scene of his creation the player playing Dick (Nightwing) came to Bruce (one of his Connections) to talk about the night prior  (the opening of the game session)  and how he was worried about the choices and lives the team had endangered.<br/>I then played Bruce as somewhat oblivious...  playing billiards with Dick all the while....  You see - in this setting for MLwtBM Bruce Wayne is "NOT" the same person as The Batman.  He IS of course actually the alter-ego of The Batman... however, the way I played him was in similar fashion to the style show for Golem in LotR-Two Towers... constantly at odds.   So when Dick pushed the issue I noted the description that he stepped into shadow and two billiard cue sticks seemed to form the points of The Batman's cowl!!  Then I deepened my voice and replied as "The Batman" ...  quickly stepping out of the shadow to return to the Bruce personality...  Back and forth until Nightwing would leave.<br/><br/>Other key points was continually giving Commands that seemed to force the Minions to put innocents (police and villains) in danger... my thought was that The Batman "knew" his minions would fix the situation.  They'd been trained.  He didn't need to worry or be concerned for the innocents - his CONCERN was the MISSION!!<br/>Another point was referring to the minions when either they did WELL or POORLY as  "Good Soldier"  or  "Bad Soldier".  Which is a call-back to the plack posted on Jason Todd's memorial in the Batcave that reads "He was a good soldier"... not sure if the group knew that easter-egg...<br/><br/><br/>Overall...  I played The Batman with the mindset of "Year One" and "Dark Knight Returns"  ... in the darkest flavor.   <br/><br/>Has "this" Batman lost his mind?!!<br/>I'm not telling -  the Soldiers may be watching... heheh...<br/><br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166715/#Comment_166715" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-02T21:48:58+00:00" title="September  2, 2008  9:48PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Alvin Frewer made some comments in my older thread, that I wanted to address here for those following...<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>One of the Good Omens guys ran My Life With Joker at ConQuest SF this past weekend.  We weren't superheroes, we were minions of the Joker. It was brilliantly done, and since we were being commanded to do bad things, it worked perfectly well with the system. We created the Joker (settled on him being a Brain/Feeder, feeding on Chaos to show Batman that he can live without rules, but what was great is that all the options could have worked) and our minions..</blockquote>\n<br/>Funny.  The Dark Knight (in my game) is a TEACHER/BEAST.<br/><br/>The thing that would be solidly unfun (for me) about a "My Life with Joker" game is that you're playing nobodies.  One inspiring part about my "My Life with The Batman"  game is that the players are all playing familiar faces.  Afterall what's the fun in playing a game (especially a short-shot) in a game setting as familiar as Gotham and NOT getting to play the big dogs.  <br/>Its the same problem I have with many RPGs like Star Wars... Its hard to play a game in the movie eras and know that you're always second fiddle to Luke, Leia, Han, etc...  I know it can be done...  I've done it.  But for this type game - it seems unfulfilliing to me and I'd rather just play a game with our own original master and minions.  Basically the GM gets all the fun (playing Joker) and I get to play the dorks in the clown masks?  No thanks.<br/><br/>\n<blockquote><br/> Two critical components that seem to be noticable lacking from My Life With Batman.  Since we worked for an evil master, all the rest of the structure still worked. I'm not sure how it can work with Batman. Maybe if his commands always enforce your role as a sidekick, and you need love for the confidence to break free?  The general idea of Batman's sidekicks rising up against him seems odd, though, and you have to reframe all the stats. The actual play didn't go into how the mechanics were changed to make it about superhero sidekicks instead of broken monster minions, so I'm still not sure how that can work.</blockquote>\n<br/>I'll try to answer your critical comments with my ideas on why/how it rocked...  In my game (so far)...<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>.  Not only did The Batman enforce the role as sidekick ("You're not good enough to fight by my side!! Go Home!!")  but, as my players will attest, The Batman SEEMED like a force of nature as dark and brooding as any dark master.  His orders were pointed but vague in what they would accomplish in the bigger plan.  And when they were specific they seemed to put innocents in danger and definately put the minions in danger  ("BAIT!"  as in be bait for the cops while I get away!).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>.  Rising up against The Batman has been a theme in many Dark Knight stories.  All of the Batman Family including Alfred have questioned Batman's nature, actions and his overall obsession.  Superman and the Justice League have all been at odds with Batman's obsessive nature.  Putting The Batman into the position similar to the way My Life with Master describes the Teacher/Beast type works perfectly.  I've reframed nothing.  I'm eager to see HOW the Endgame and Prologues play out - with NO rules changed.  If the player decides his character WOULD kill The Batman then that will happen.  If not, then perhaps they take him to Arkham or have the Justice League deal with him  (al la Mind Wipe, which they did a few years ago!!  Which Batman has recently learned about in the comics!).  My PCs have both options.  I have players playing Azrael and the Huntress - who could potentially kill the Bat if they create the Endgame.  And Nightwing, Robin and Spoiler might go the other way.  Either way - The Batman needs reigned in.  That's what THIS game is all about.  Taking down the master.  What better tragic style gaming is there than to take down the legend?  Does justice really win if they take down this "good man" who's gone a little off the path??  That's tragic.  That's My Life with Master all the way!!<br/><br/><br/>Overall... I read the style and flavor of My Life with Master and took the Batman I'm familiar with from "Year One" and "Dark Knight Returns" and amped that darkness up a notch or two - being careful NOT to overtly murder people but hint at going over the line while putting the minions into hard decisions throught commands...<br/><br/><br/>hope that helps.<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166797/#Comment_166797" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-03T10:14:39+00:00" title="September  3, 2008 10:14AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2008 10:15AM by Jogesh EZ.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, thanks for answering those. I wasn't sure that you'd want this thread cluttered with such mechanical questions. That helps a lot, although I'm still struggling with the idea.<br/><br/>As for the "fun" in playing nobodies, well, I absolutely hate his sidekicks (well, Robin), and that might color some of my reaction. It was definitely more fun to make my psychotic scissor freak than playing a pre-existing character especially Joker's nameless clowns or Batman's named sidekicks (some sidekicks might be fun, but I'm mostly ignorant of them, and prefer my own creations even in straight supers games). We were like the lieutenants, commanding vans filled with clowns as part of narration. I think the giggling height challenged mad scientist, the repulsive tattoo covered masochist, and April Fool, the Joker fangirl were all excellent and added flavor in ways that existing characters might have been limiting. Creating your characters will automatically make them more fun than playing nobodies (which is how I view Batman's sidekicks). Part of the point of My Life With Master is that you do start out as a nobody. The game is about the tenuous path between becoming somebody and destruction as your work yourself out from under the thumb of the Master.<br/><br/>Even for My Life With Batman, I personally wouldn't be happy using pregens, unless it was simply to shortcut a 4 hour con slot or something (the game I was in was set for 6 hours, which was plenty of time to create and play). But if someone loves Bat-mite, there shouldn't be a reason why they can't make Bat-mite while the other 3 players are making new characters (or whatever). But looking at the PDFs it does look like you give them everything but the stats, so maybe that's enough. More Than and Less Than seem to be the biggest factors when it comes to roleplay. That might even be enough for me. But the usual answer to the Han, Leia and Luke problem isn't to give the players Han, Leia and Luke, but to remove them from the equation entirely by changing the canon or the time period. So I'm interested in how giving them those characters (well, Lando, Chewie and C3PO) works.<br/><br/>So, another mechanics question. Since you didn't reframe anything, I'm curious how some things went down.  Especially, how did More Than Human and Less Than Human get defined by your players for their characters? You have Self-Loathing still defined as how much the minion believes they are a monster. Does that come up in play? How does it manifest? Batman's sidekicks seem to be more well adjusted than he is, so I'm especially curious how Less Than Human is working out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168011/#Comment_168011" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-09T12:25:02+00:00" title="September  9, 2008 12:25PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've finally finished my "story" update.<br/>Game session <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is upcoming this Thursday...<br/><br/><br/><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/mylifewiththebatman/Home/necessary-evils" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://sites.google.com/site/mylifewiththebatman/Home/necessary-evils</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_168640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168640/#Comment_168640" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T09:15:00+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  9:15AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            WOW!!<br/><br/>Just wanted to post quickly with some highlights of the wrap to my 2-part MY LIFE WITH THE BATMAN game...<br/>I'll be writing up a "blow-by-blow" (round-by-round) recap and a story recap again... and I'm considering writing this out in module style (if people would be interested).  So if you're interested in playing - you might not want to read my next few posts.  heheh...<br/><br/>But to jump right in... the game wasn't a "game" - it was a FREAKIN "Elseworlds" MASTERPIECE!!  <br/>Wow... all the players felt the same way.  I'm just not sure it could have gone off better.  Not only were there brilliant action and drama from the plot twists but the players gave way more than they got by exemplifying the perfect play of the Bat-Family...  Truly unbelievable.<br/><br/>Quickly - here are highlights from "Part II":<br/><br/><br/>-  As he took photos of the Mayor's sex scandel (dresses as Superman with a young boy in a Robin costume) the real Robin was then captured (as per the rules) at the opening of the game by Deadshot, tied and restrained and "given" to the mayor as a new treat...  ewww!!  (thank god he escaped)<br/>-  Nightwing following The Batman's command to sink a ferry full of dignitaries, surprised to see they were all the JLA in their alter egos.<br/>-  Huntress learning that the Batman was really in disguise as Father Flannigan (who Azreal had confessed to the nights prior).<br/>-  Harley-Quinn's grizzly cackling death, electrocuted when she was thrown back into the generators of the Gotham Power Plant, shutting down power across Gotham.<br/>-  The power grid shutdown releasing all the inmate of Arkham, prisoners in jails and releasing the securities on the Batcave...<br/>-  Spoiler learning that Thomas and Martha Wayne's graves had been robbed<br/>-  At the exact same time as the reveal for Spoiler, Nightwing and Robin were able to get into Bruce's study with the securities down where they found the Joker tied up and tortured for literally days, having been "lectured" by The Batman (video taped) sitting between the decomposed bodies of Bruce's parents!! <br/>-  the reveal of The Batman's plan... luring Superman to Gotham, with Arkham's worst and the JLA running amok in Gotham as distraction.<br/>-  Superman being hit by a green "laser" from the OMAC "Brother Eye" Satellite, the (surprise) being controlled by the master... THE BATMAN!  (as Huntress watched)<br/>-  Superman is The Batman's "ONE MANY ARMY CORP"  (or the funny name... Superman Army Corp... "SMAC)  <br/>-  The JLA distracted saving Gotham from Arkham inmates, while Superman executes villains (looking for the JLA as well!)<br/>-  Green Lantern being cut in half by Superman's heat vision (under control of The Batman)!!<br/>-  Robin and Nightwing working to overcome the OMAC satellite... asking Connor Kent (Superboy) to breech orbit to destroy it!<br/>-  Both the Huntress and Azreal meet "endgame" conditions in the same round!<br/>-  While Azreal isn't near enough to face The Bat, he takes on the puppet Superman!!  Superman begins to rip him apart, but he does his job distracting him as...<br/>-  The Huntress confronts The Batman!  Not able to use her crossbow on him (due to her "Less Than"), she tries but he's too strong even with the help of others giving her aid via the com-signal  (the best was Robin noting "Helena, 2 years ago Bruce sustained an injure to his left quadratic...")...<br/>-  Then the player playing Huntress requested a "desperation" bonus die, noting it'd make sense once he narrated...  he proceeded to speak the words of a Green Lantern!  You see as the Huntress had just overcome her greatest fears (meeting the endgame conditions and overcoming the Master)  she was in greatest need and pure of heart and strong of will...  With Hal Jordan having been slaughtered a scene earlier - the ring would come to "the Emerald Huntress"!!!!<br/><br/>epilogues<br/>-  The Emerald Huntress takes down The Bat, seeing Bruce through the ripped cowl and holds back from killing him - poetically taking him to become the first of the inmates of the newly constructed Arkham.<br/>-  Spoiler, having saved he child in the chaos of the villains amok leaves Gotham forever to find a new life out of the supers scene.<br/>-  Azreal,  having stood toe-to-toe with Superman as distraction he was seconds away from death as Clark ripped off his armor face-plate with heat vision burning... the OMAC was destroyed and Superman went unconscious as they both fell out of the sky Superman barely saved Jean Paul's life but Azreal would be forever in a coma from the battle!<br/>-  Robin and Nightwing form up with the JLA, ensuring that the world will be safe again... that this could never happen again (both The Batman and the JLA's mindwipes)<br/><br/><br/>more later...<br/>AWESOME!!<br/>-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168653">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168653/#Comment_168653" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T10:01:03+00:00" title="September 12, 2008 10:01AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played Spoiler - and (as usual) Kev ran a great game.

Even "insane" people can be genius.<br/>One fun (other) note - I even worked in The Batman's ability to be a master disguise artist, when it was revealed that he was actually in the guise of Father Flannigan all along - having been the one to listen to Azreal's confession and suggest that he "heed the master's call".  In one sense it seemed like a note to listen to your heart and god.  In the other sense it was to listen to The Bat.  Funny/cool that it actually worked as both.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite><br/>When both Azraerl and the Huntress met "endgame" conditions, how was decided who'll be facing the Bat and who'll be the distraction?

It was quite inspiring to see Azreal's player choose to "give up" taking out The Bat when he also had the right to do so.  However, he freakin' got to take on Superman!!  And his Endgame story was just as powerful.<br/><br/>At that point the story was in a "moment-to-moment" (or panel to panel) mode where we were all playing scenes within the same time period of that final night...  <br/>Frankly Azreal was still speeding back to Gotham (from Metropolis, having been the one to draw Superman to Gotham - which was intentional by the Bat since Azreal was arguably the most one-for-one powerful of the Bat-family, if not the most dangerous).  So he wasn't in position to be able to face off with The Bat.<br/>And aptly, Huntress (arguably the most manipulate of the Bat-family, as she is actively the one on the outside of the family) was at the Catholic church where Batman intended to draw Superman (the connection to the church was due to a minions connection being located their - forcing Azreal into some tough moral dilemma if things hit the fan...).  The Huntress was RIGHT THEIR when Superman stormed in to the call of (the fake) Lois Lane's scream.

Was I reading more than what it actually was?</blockquote>\n<br/><br/>No you weren't reading incorrectly.<br/>The fact that it's modern-day and the connection (literally) that the Bat-minions have made this very very workable.  They ALL had access to any manner of com or cell-phone connection when not near one another.  On top of that I had The Batman (and through Oracle) guiding, watching and giving them NEW orders on the fly through their Bat-com.  I used this to allow the players to role-play and talk together as warranted.  No one overused the tool, and many times they went "private line" to talk with one another separately.  <br/>And as any good master should... The Batman had all "override" of these communications anytime he wanted to burst in with a command.  And (what the PCs didn't know was) The Batman was listening to all conversations at all times having bugged EACH minion.  Hence the cool aspect of having the Master know ALL THINGS.  As is appropriate and strongly suggested in the My Life with Master master suggestions.  The Batman made the perfect modern day version of a Master in this way, in that he is a genius and insanely paranoid but extremely calculating... and yes... Machiavellian!<br/><br/>However you are right with the original premise of MLwM staging.  Set in the darker times, the scenes wouldn't have been appropriate to communicate as much together...  I chose to USE this modern tech to amplify the power and paranoia of my master.<br/><br/>Then again - we did have mini-teams at times.  I mean it WAS patterned after a comic book... Team-up are perfectly in genre.<br/><br/><br/>At the beginning of the story I set PCs in mini-teams to start with a BANG of action, but not so "distant" or confusing in that their were only three total scenes:<br/>-  Nightwing and Spoiler  (on an adjacent building to the Bat, chased by canine units)<br/>-  Huntress and Azreal   (leading police away from the building while on cycles)<br/>-  Robin with The Batman  (on the roof with the Joker)<br/>This broke shortly after to allow individual Overture scenes.<br/><br/>Another point that lead to some "team-ups" was that several PCs were actually Connections of one another.  As planned by the players based on their character's background.<br/><br/>Nightwing and Robin were together for a good portion of the story.  Which is strangely PERFECTLY appropriate to the source material (comics) in style.  And I don't believe the players planned it that way, it was just natural that they set up their connection and other investigation scenes up around the same places.<br/><br/>Azreal and Huntress team-up for a short time through an Overture by Azreal to aid Huntress in capturing Harley-Quinn.<br/><br/>Azreal and Spoiler were together for a very short time near the Endgame, as when The Batman learned that Azreal was on his way back to Gotham sooner than he had anticipated (after luring Superman from Metropolis)  The Batman ordered Azreal to the "out of the way" cemetary as a distraction with Spoiler.  The distraction was of course meant to horrify young Stephanie (Spoiler) which in a NEAT way worked exactly as planned since her player chose to have Steph's epilogue see her leaving Gotham and starting a new life out of action.  Azreal however didn't stay to discover the missing bodies of Wayne's parents.  They could see Gotham's power grid starting to go down, so he (resisted orders and) torn down to the Power Plant to confront Harley-Quinn ...  he managed a huge success, killing her - but unintentionally saw her complete the plan when her electrocution death destroyed the power grid completely.  He then rushed to aid the Justice League stopping Arkham lunatics...
