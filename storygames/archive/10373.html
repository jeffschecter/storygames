This is discussed at length on forums and blogs dedicated to D&amp;D. It's a pretty wildly accepted problem and become more so accepted and talked about daily. Even people in the RPGA (who usually following the rules strictly) are changing more of the rules so they have more time to play. <br/><br/>The 4 hour time slot is key as this is less of a problem if you play for 8 hours (which we don't).<br/><br/><br/>(snip)  Many people only play 1 game semi-regularly or infrequently. So more is on the line when they play. It had better be worth it. And when it isn't, since they are playing only 1 game, it's easier to hack that game till it fits their needs. Which makes sense.</blockquote>\n<br/>I have similar experiences, though mainly with D&amp;D 3/3.5/etc. Though 2-3 times I did play D&amp;D 4E this was a deal-breaker problem, though I suspect most of that was due to our unfamiliarity. <br/><br/>John, some questions for you: \n<ul>\n<li>Can you point me at any of the discussions/blog entries you mention? </li>\n<li>Can you elaborate a bit on what the non-story games crowd thinks about this in general? </li>\n<li>What are some of the solutions?</li>\n<li>Any other thoughts, of course!</li>\n</ul>\nAnd, everyone, some questions for you:\n<ul>\n<li>Talk about problems you have with this. (Respectfully, if you have no problem with this, ok. But, I want to hear from those who do.)</li>\n<li>What are your solutions?</li>\n<li>Do you think this is a symptom of "growing up" and having fewer of those marathon weekend sessions? (I do.)</li>\n<li>How do others you play with feel about this? Are they frustrated? Are they frustrated by your group's solutions, too? (Mine are -- jumping around on games means no "campaigns" and they don't like it.)</li>\n<li>Any thing else!</li>\n</ul>\nI'll post later some thoughts I have about this one.

They are there for the fights and the bang-zoom, and more than the minimal level of "story stuff" necessary to plausibly motivate and point them at the fights is not really a priority.<br/><br/>The problem was worse, in a way, with the previous incarnation of D&amp;D, because the fights were often unsatisfyingly swingy. An awful lot of the "roleplaying" that got done in my pre-4E D&amp;D was aimed at setting up overwhelming advantage in the next fight or circumventing fights. Anything rp-wise that didn't contribute to that goal was strongly disapproved - since NOT going into fights with maximum advantage was a good way to lose.<br/><br/>D&amp;D, in all of its incarnations, has always had an uneasy relationship with story/character/situation-driven play.<br/><br/>I do see a lot more of the devotion to mixing story/rp with your asskicking in D&amp;D and its ilk in groups that have one or more of the following characteristics...<br/><br/>1. The entire group has very high rules mastery<br/>2. The group contains a high number of habitual GMs<br/>3. The group has been playing together for a long time and is mostly static in membership<br/>4. The group plays very long sessions (over 6 hours) or very frequent sessions (at least weekly).<br/><br/>I don't see this as something that really needs solving unless it's making people unhappy - and largely it doesn't in my groups. RP-heavy play is something you get from other games - either pre-3E D&amp;D, retroclones, or something else entirely (in approximately that frequency distro).<br/><br/>My only frustration with it has been that since D&amp;D is what's easy to recruit for, I end up playing a lot of D&amp;D - and not having space in my schedule (and those of the players I know who'd be open to it) to play other games as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230578/#Comment_230578" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T10:03:04+00:00" title="September  8, 2009 10:03AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm currently not playing in a 4E game for this exact reason.  3-4 hour sessions, once a week, and to get the role-playing and character interaction that they want, many, many encounters are taking 2 or even 3 weeks to conclude.  <br/><br/>Sometimes no sex <i>is</i> better than bad sex.<br/><br/>James                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230579/#Comment_230579" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T10:10:04+00:00" title="September  8, 2009 10:10AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This frustration is partially why I gave all my 4E books to Dev and am currently running Mouse Guard. Seriously, the amount of time that the GM has to put into running a 4E/3.5 game (at least one that doesn't suck and has hooky narrative stuff going on) is insane, in my experience. The amount of time the players have to spend mastering the system is also insane. If you've already spent years of your life mastering D&amp;D, I guess that's not a big problem.  However, for my time investment, Mouse Guard, Dogs, Agon, and TSOY are what I'd reach for if I want something fighty that still prioritizes engaging with the fiction (though, that doesn't always happen in Agon, I find; "What are we fighting this time? Harpies? I toss a javelin.").  Even on the denser side, I'd reach for Burning Wheel, Warhammer 2nd, or True20/M&amp;M before D&amp;D.<br/><br/>The other solution is to go with the now growing pile of games that rock-out as one-shots: Montsegur 1244, Mist-Robed Gate, It's Complicated, Danger Patrol, Geiger Counter, etc.  Or the ones specifically designed for short arcs: Mountain Witch, My Life with Master, Polaris, Dust Devils, a lot of the "Forge classics" fall into this category for a number of reasons. I do think that, for some folks at least, these games aren't necessarily crunchy enough to provide what they want from roleplaying, but the fighty games listed above also thrive as 3-6 session arcs, so that's not really a problem.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I definitely get frustrated when games can't deliver meaningful plot or character development in 4 hours, at least enough so that you feel like you've watched an episode of a good television series. But I think there are plenty of games out there, especially indie games, that don't have this problem, so I'm only frustrated that I spent so much time trying to make 4E work for me, when I could have much easier been playing something else that would have been more fulfilling. The difference between running Mouse Guard for the first time (with nearly zero Burning Wheel background) and running 4E for the first time (with very little D&amp;D background) was stark and obvious, in my case. One was great and only got better while the other started out fun but gradually got worse as the mechanics pulled us down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230581/#Comment_230581" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T10:19:41+00:00" title="September  8, 2009 10:19AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2009 10:23AM by J_Walton.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Or to summarize my experience in another way...<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://plays-well.com/HBP_dungeon1.jpg" width="500"/><br/><br/>D&amp;D made playing through <i>that dungeon</i> inconsistently fun.

D&amp;D; is like this but so is the board game Twilight Imperium. The box says that you can play it in four hours. We used to play it on a weekly basis, and really, the best were the sessions with three players who were all super familiar with the rules and rhythm of the game. Those were also the only sessions where someone technically won by the 'short game' rules in <i>five</i> hours. D&amp;D; 4e strikes me as less stream-lined and structured than TI.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also like to add that during these board game sessions we found times and spaces to role-play. In fact, more than I ever did at a D&amp;D; table at a con.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy point then, is the idea that in four hours with four or more players you can run through a combat encounter with all that tactical fiddly stuff going on is unrealistic. Which leads me to a point I always make: the reason all that ultra-fiddly stuff works and is cool in MMOs is that the computer does the math for you and you get to be distracted by the pretty graphics.

This exists. People who like it, play it. They're a niche market. Taking away the stuff that makes combat play slowly also takes away the stuff that makes it interesting ... and <b>sells books</b>.<br><br>I think the popularity of retroclones is in part built on rebellion against combat-centric play, but it's hard to say. The <b>culture</b> of the Old School Movement (such as it is) doesn't really lean that way, but the actual play of retroclones I've seen is very much driven by the desire to remove mechanics from center stage.<br><br>What would a "D&amp;D lite" require? Not being D&amp;D. The core game of D&amp;D has been tactical miniature combat with LOTS of unit customization and flexible action options for 10 years now. This is clearly the heart of the current market. I'm pretty sure that the mass market -whose core is teens and 20-somethings with lots of time on their hands and an urge to obsessive systematization- is well served by it.<br><br>I think that those who want story/character-centric fantasy RP would do very, very well to give up trying to "fix D&amp;D" and just move on.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230631/#Comment_230631" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T13:20:48+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  1:20PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 8, 2009 5:47PM by Nathan_H.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: blankshield</cite>Sometimes no sex<i>is</i>better than bad sex.</blockquote>What?  <br>By no, um do you mean the lack of something?<br>I've had no sex, and let me tell you I'll take bad sex any day.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac" title="Bercilac"><img alt="Bercilac" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bercilac">Bercilac</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230697/#Comment_230697" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T19:32:51+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  7:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I kind of like D&amp;D's plethora of rules.

Or pick a rule that sounds about right (hmmm... um... dexterity check!) and go for it.<br><br>2.  The DM really ought to be a rules expert, just to have a lot to choose from for a given situation.  Maybe not all of the supplements, but know how to grapple, tumble, social skills rolls, and modifiers for weird situations.<br><br>3.  If a DM makes a ruling but a player can IMMEDIATELY cite a counter-rule, I'd go with the player.  I've found it frustrating when I design a character so I KNOW it should be able to perform in a certain way, undertake certain tasks, and the DM uses his privilege to handwave my abilities away.

I'm actually just starting to experiment with drifting the rules a bit more heavily.  What I've been doing is more additive than subtractive or, ah, changeitive.  A good example of what I mean is something that I did during this week's session and the one before it:<br/><br/>The PCs are involved in a long string of arena battles, in a Roman-style coliseum.  Their choice and for legitimate plot reasons: They entered as professionals, but they are ultimately trying to save a group of condemned prisoners, who are innocent and much lower-level than them.  I'm having them alternate between playing their regular PCs and playing the condemned, which has been leading up to a "showdown" between both parties (which of course they're going to try to subvert).  So that was kind of indie, and my PCs have really enjoyed exploring alternate roles and characters, albeit briefly.<br/><br/>Moreover, after each fight, I've asked the players to take turns describing other entertainment that they've seen in the coliseum.  They've been really creative and cool!  My quietest, shyest player,* in fact, tonight, burst out with this awesome thing about a chariot race where the chariots all have spikes on the wheels.  It was great!<br/><br/>Now, I don't think there's anything in the DMG saying not to do these things, at least not explicitly.  But it's not something I would have thought of had I not played several dozen indie games in the last few years.<br/><br/>So, it's working great.  We're having fast, fun combats, lots of challenge and "stepping up," and neat narrative fictional elements too.  The only real problem is that I have to remain the DM, because I know no one else in the group could do what I'm doing.<br/><br/>Matt<br/><br/>*A bit of a stereotypical "gaming girlfriend," in fact, who sort of comes as a unit with her fiance and never games on her own, who has recently been coming out of her shell.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230805/#Comment_230805" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T09:31:17+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  9:31AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I played Force Unleashed on the Wii a couple weeks back...(the graphics are atrocious compared to the XBox version but waving around the controler and punching with the nunchuk was way cooler control scheme).<br/>\n<br/>\nI noticed (again) this thing.  Its the same thing I noticed playing Dungeon Siege and Fable and older consoles like Lightening Force.  They are called "roleplaying games" but what they really are are graphic novels.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn many cases there aren't even basic path choices.  In Force Unleashed Vader say "go to this planet and kill this guy" so you go to that planet and you travel along the path that the map lays out (old school RTS single player map style) and you kill EVERYTHING you encounter on that path...you find the guy...you kill him...and repeat about a dozen times until the game ends.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat made this fun?  Well, the story wasn't HORRIBLE.  It was oh so predictable but the graphic part of the graphic novel made it fun to tool around the junk work vs. the crazy fungal fores world.  It wasn't much but it was juuuust enough to keep you interested in what was going to happen next (as an aside if you were to argue that it doesn't have a story, just a running plot line, I would agree).  But the REAL fun came from choosing which combination of Jedi Force Powers you were going use, which was a combination of how you like to fight and what control schema you were better at mastering.  I wound up maxing out my Force shove and lightening powers and so basically walked calmly down the paths zapping hordes of people with lightning and punching them across the room with my nunchuck.  But there were a good couple of dozens of options.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo it was never a question of can I get through this.  But simply what combination of buttons should I push to get through this and see what's next.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFrom my perspective that's what 4E is designed to do.  Its not about story.  Its about having juuuust enough of a running plot line that what happens next seems interesting enough to want to see.  Its not REALLY about the tactical gamesmanship of "are we skillfull enough players to defeat this encounter".  Its really IMO about having fun pushing the buttons, watching the monsters die as a result of you pushing the buttons and seeing what's next.<br/>\n<br/>\nI suspect, that if one were to go through the game and streamline it with that in mind, a whole whole lot of the stuff that slows play down (in service to misguided efforts to provide "story" or "challenge" opportunities) would disappear...and the game would be much more exactly what Jonathan needed it to be for his Final Fantasy dungeon crawl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230808/#Comment_230808" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-09T09:46:41+00:00" title="September  9, 2009  9:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph,<br><br>That sounds about right.

I definitely agree with criticisms like these in that four hours is almost always not enough for what I would consider a well-rounded, satisfying gaming experience. There's a very slow launch factor to a session, and combats average about an hour to two hours, so trying to get some sort of emotional or narrative sense of progression within that time frame is pretty challenging.<br><br>We usually have six-hour sessions and that seems just about right.<br><br>The vast majority of hacks and playtips I see online are geared towards speeding up combat. The pacing of the game seems slower in this edition than it has ever been. Playing it well can require both player patience and a game master with a strong sense of enthusiasm and momentum.<br><br>And yet we're still totally in love with it, more than all previous editions. Here's my theory why:<br><br>Basically, you can get a heck of a lot of roleplaying mileage out of the combat itself. 4th edition feels like it's written to really bring out the evocative and dynamic character traits based on how each character fights. With good players and good GMing, these can bleed out very well into character personalities and narrative struggles. Granted, some people might see characters primarily based on some sort of combat focus as being pretty limiting, but if you're a group of hack-and-slashers like us, it's basically our bread and butter and is exactly the kind of creative limitation we most enjoy swimming around in (what would you call it? The psychotic kill-happy dungeon-delving treasure-lust milieu?).<br><br>D&amp;D's always sort of straddled this line between skirmish wargaming and epic character development, it's not a new world that this edition is inhabiting.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233345">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kiznit" title="kiznit"><img alt="kiznit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kiznit">kiznit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233345/#Comment_233345" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-20T21:58:34+00:00" title="September 20, 2009  9:58PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 20, 2009 10:01PM by kiznit.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Looks like dungeonmastering.com (a popular 4E D&amp;D blog) is coming to the same conclusions:<br><br/><a href="http://games.dungeonmastering.com/zombie-murder-mystery/" rel="nofollow">The Short Campaign Manifesto</a></br></blockquote>\nI do believe you have the wrong link there.<br/><br/>Here's where you meant to go:<br/><a href="http://www.dungeonmastering.com/campaigns-adventures/the-short-campaign-manifesto" rel="nofollow">http://www.dungeonmastering.com/campaigns-adventures/the-short-campaign-manifesto</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233389/#Comment_233389" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T06:51:14+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  6:51AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 21, 2009 6:53AM by komradebob.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>To look at Matt's second set of questions...<br/><br/>No, I don't think there's really a market niche for "D&amp;D, but optimized to play fast and light". This exists. People who like it, play it. They're a niche market. Taking away the stuff that makes combat play slowly also takes away the stuff that makes it interesting ... and<b>sells books</b>.</blockquote>\nI think the bolded part has a lot to do with the issue. There are, as mentioned, games that are already tactical and minis-oriented and lite, where combat is quick as hell. But there is only so much to write about that and hence only so much to be sold. Part of the whole Supplement Treadmill is about visibility and awareness.\n<blockquote>I think the popularity of retroclones is in part built on rebellion against combat-centric play, but it's hard to say. The<b>culture</b>of the Old School Movement (such as it is) doesn't really lean that way, but the actual play of retroclones I've seen is very much driven by the desire to remove mechanics from center stage.</blockquote>\nI'd say the OSR is very much about combat, at least IME. I don't think it is about removing mechanics, either. In a way, I think a lot of it is about a changing attitude towards the GM and why they're there. It strikes me that a good bit of the player-level Players vs. GM antagonism that seemed to permeate gaming culture for a while has dropped off again. I see a lot more GM-as-facillitator-of-Fun coming back into gaming culture, rather than GM-as-Antagonist-to-be-defeated.\n<blockquote>What would a "D&amp;D lite" require? Not being D&amp;D. The core game of D&amp;D has been tactical miniature combat with LOTS of unit customization and flexible action options for 10 years now. This is clearly the heart of the current market. I'm pretty sure that the mass market -whose core is teens and 20-somethings with lots of time on their hands and an urge to obsessive systematization- is well served by it.</blockquote>\nThat would seem to match quite well with design  and market goals outright stated for D&amp;D from 3.0 on.\n<blockquote>I think that those who want story/character-centric fantasy RP would do very, very well to give up trying to "fix D&amp;D" and just move on.</blockquote>\nOr, frankly, not very character/story-centric RPing. At least not in an artsy way.<br/><br/>Look, I know this thread is about D&amp;D 4e, but I'd like to point folks somewhere, a Yahoo Group for a little pulp minis game called Astounding Tales. I'm not selling the game ( in fact, I think there's still a free early version of the game rules somewhere out on the internet). Yeah, I know it's a hassle to sign up for yet another Yahoo group just to look at something, but just trust me on this one.<br/><br/><a href="http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/astounding-tales/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://ca.groups.yahoo.com/group/astounding-tales/</a><br/><br/>Go there, take a look through the photos section and the AP reports. Check out the Nazis Invade Ruritania entries as a good example.<br/><br/>Why that system and that game?<br/>For one thing, it's a lite-weight, largely stand-alone game with a rulebook weighing in at about the same pagecount as Moldvay Basic. As seen in the photos, it's a tactical game ( although the designer regularly gets accused onlne of trying to pawn off an RPG on honest minis gamers by minis gamers). For another, it's about the opposite of 4E when it comes to the number of fights/encounters that occur in a session-people play tons of encounters in a session of play. By comparison, tons of stuff happens in a four or six or eight hour block of time.<br/> <br/>It's also built to be played episodic if you choose to play it as such. The use of minis and terrain practically require that it be done that way in some sense. If part of the problem is the way the open-ended campaign has developed in RPGs,this takes a different track. This is about game sessions that are largely self-contained, that could be tied together if players choose to do so, but there is no requirement that they must be.<br/><br/><br/><br/>It isn't the only game out there like that, either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233413/#Comment_233413" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T08:15:46+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  8:15AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Now, I don't think there's anything in the DMG saying not to do these things, at least not explicitly.  But it's not something I would have thought of had I not played several dozen indie games in the last few years.</blockquote>\nThese techniques (player agency stuff) are made explicit in the DMG2, by the way. The first two dozen pages of this book contain some of the best GMing advice I've read in a long, long time.<br/><br/>I continue to boggle at the artificial division between combat and role-playing. If you're not role-playing while you're fighting, you're doing it wrong. You should always be role-playing when you're playing D&amp;D. Always. Is there a metric shit-ton of fighting in D&amp;D? Hell yeah. If you don't enjoy that, it's not a game for you.<br/><br/>I'm really curious: What kind of role-playing would you rather be doing? Earlier editions of D&amp;D got so much criticism for promising dungeons and dragons and Gandalf, but delivering dungeons and kobolds and a lamer version of Harry Potter. Now 4E delivers the feeling that you're an awesome dude right from the start. You can fight dragons at 1st level. You aren't a 4-hit-point wizard anymore. The village guy who sells you candles doesn't have more hit points than you. You are now full empowered to go out into the scary wilderness and kick ass, take names, and save the world. Do you mean to tell me that you want this to be a game not about doing that?<br/><br/>Also, what have you done as a DM to help the role-playing happen? If you're just running canned modules with no modification, you'll get a canned-module feel. You might find hooks to wrap a character's goals around, but it's tough. Canned modules need a little love to make them work, to make players care about what happens in them. If you're running adventures you created, where is the stuff that makes players care?  <br/><br/><b>Jonathan</b>, I'm gonna call you out a little but it's done with love. You made this awesomely cool-looking dungeon tile set, but I think you may have removed the personality of the world with your 8-bit thing. Were players able to care about the plot or the plight of these byte-sized characters? If you just reduced them to tokens, and offered barely a plot, it turns into a meaningless dungeon crawl. If you aren't engaged with the tactical game for its own sake, and there's no story that engages players, of course things will fall apart.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>From my perspective that's what 4E is designed to do.  Its not about story.  Its about having juuuust enough of a running plot line that what happens next seems interesting enough to want to see.  Its not REALLY about the tactical gamesmanship of "are we skillfull enough players to defeat this encounter".  Its really IMO about having fun pushing the buttons, watching the monsters die as a result of you pushing the buttons and seeing what's next.</blockquote>\n<b>Ralph</b>, I really don't get that from my 4E play. When I made mistakes in my tactical play, my friends' characters suffered as a result. I paid closer attention when I leveled up and retooled my PC a bit so I could support my friends better. We had some near-TPK experiences but got much better as time passed. And the story is incredibly important to me. I had specific things I wanted to do with my cleric PC, ways I wanted to see him change, if possible. <br/><br/>I can't quite figure out why my 4E experiences seem so different from everyone else's. I'm not saying "you're doing it wrong." Maybe I am the one doing it wrong and I'm drifting the game so that it works, or something. I just want to understand this huge disconnect.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233416/#Comment_233416" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T08:26:51+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  8:26AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Responding to the OP) My slots are essentially 3 hours long.

How much "story" is happening in a combat is up to you, though. If you have a series of rooms and there's a combat in each one of them, and no "story" happens until you clear out 6 rooms, then you will have to play for 6+ hours before you get any story. Or you can make sure that each encounter advances the story in some meaningful way, and then you get story every time you fight.<br/><br/>I tend to have sessions that are about 3 hours of real play. People show up at 7 and leave by 11, and there's probably pizza in there somewhere and the usual chatter and stuff at the beginning. That means 2 combat encounters and 2-3 non-combat encounters.<br/><br/>In my last session, the players looked at their quest cards and picked one involving investigation of some giant flying insects. They met with Oxford's mayor and got some leads, so there was a little role-playing there. There was a feeling that if they didn't deal with this insect threat now, it could be much worse later on. Then they went exploring in the city and found a giant ant scout team. They attacked the ants and destroyed them. That was the first combat encounter and it took about 45 minutes. The group then followed the trail towards some construction noise and discovered a very large ant work detail disassembling some buildings, stone by stone. It was like 12 minions and 6 other ants, so a pretty large monster group. They ambushed the ants and slew them. That took over an hour but was great fun. Throughout the combat encounters, there was definite characterization and role-playing happening, partly due to the "you all just discovered you Oxfordians are in this D&amp;D world and you're getting weird powers" aspect of the campaign premise. Play ended that night with the group discussing, in-character, their options for proceeding and some exploration. I let them find a 50-foot-tall ant hill made of city debris, crawling with giant ants. Tomorrow night (9/22), they will likely assault it.<br/><br/>How much "story" was there? Well, the first encounter was very short, let two new PCs meet the mayor (an important NPC) and establish that the PCs are the only people in the city who can really respond to major threats. The second encounter introduced the ants and established that they seem to be dangerous in a fight (not a ton of story there, but it was the first combat encounter for two PCs). The third encounter established that the ants were disassembling the city for some reason. The huge number of minions really made it feel like a giant swarm overtaking Oxford. The last teaser encounter underscored the menace that the ants represent. They will convert the entire city into a giant ant mound if the PCs don't stop it. And how can they stop such a large number of ants?<br/><br/>Throughout the combats, we had little vignettes like characters reacting negatively to another PC's spooky illusions, or the cleric giving a decidedly Christian (Anglican) flavor to his holy powers. The goliath fighter kept insisting that if he'd been allowed to bring a few casks of hard liquor, he could have solved the pest problem easily with some flint and steel. There were some cool IC teamwork moments, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233432/#Comment_233432" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T09:18:07+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  9:18AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite><b>Jonathan</b>, I'm gonna call you out a little but it's done with love.</blockquote>\nAnd I'm going to take you to task a little for not knowing enough about the situation to properly do that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>You made this awesomely cool-looking dungeon tile set, but I think you may have removed the personality of the world with your 8-bit thing.</blockquote>\nYou would be badly mistaken.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Were players able to care about the plot or the plight of these byte-sized characters?</blockquote>\nSure. 4E undermined that at every turn, but it was there in the fiction and at the table.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>If you just reduced them to tokens, and offered barely a plot, it turns into a meaningless dungeon crawl.</blockquote>\nYour notions of why the game failed are generic and simplistic, and fail to address the situation at hand.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>If you aren't engaged with the tactical game for its own sake, and there's no story that engages players, of course things will fall apart.</blockquote>\nThings fell apart despite having both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233448/#Comment_233448" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T10:49:25+00:00" title="September 21, 2009 10:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233457">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233457/#Comment_233457" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T11:29:19+00:00" title="September 21, 2009 11:29AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Problems I have: 4E can absolutely lend itself to flavorless play, and it is not a strong enough tactical boardgame to hold my interest if it's played without flavor. I don't think the first three rulebooks provide substantial context for gamers who are not used to bolting on their own flavor; this is particularly problematic in that 3.X was successfully simulationist in a way that mechanically generated a great deal of flavor.<br/><br/>Solutions: roleplay the living hell out of combat. If my monsters don't have personalities, I am failing as a GM. They must act as though they expect to elicit emotional reactions from the player characters. Expectations often create actions (ask any trained negotiator), so that helps immensely. Open the door and narrate enemy emotional reactions at times even if they wouldn't be apparent to the characters: let the players in on the shared fiction. It's an easy way to make it clear that the fiction exists. <br/><br/>Concrete example: I'm running yesterday for my sweetie Susan and my old friend Jeff and his SO, Emily. I have a couple of paragraphs of background written about Longfinger Harris, crime lord, and his untimely death, and the player characters are three low-lives who see a chance to cash in. The first fight is the classic goblin fight, since they have some powers which I think illustrate some important things about 4E combat. (As it happens they didn't get to use them, so what do I know?)<br/><br/>The goblin hexer has a power that allows him to put a goblin ally in the way of a ranged attack. He does a lot of that early on, using a bunch of minions as cannon fodder. The avenger comes up next to him in due course, and takes a melee swing. So: "OK, the shaman-looking goblin goes to grab that ragged guy next to him and put him in the way, but this time the little goblin squawks! 'No, no! The shiny lights are pretty, you can put me in that, but she has an AXE!'"<br/><br/>That is completely unnecessary work from a tactical standpoint. I mean, the goblin hexer just can't use that power of his on melee attacks. I could have just let the swing happen without any fictional embellishment, but talking through it gave the goblins more personality and established the fiction. <br/><br/>Once the last minion next to the hexer died, a bit later, the hexer yelled over at the goblins on the other side of the field to come join him. From a pure tactical position, the hexer was right -- getting picked off one by one was useless, and hiding in the hexer's cloud of murk was a win. The minions on that side of things came over obediently. The warriors did not, because duh, they're smart, they're warriors. "Hell with you, boss, we see what you did to little Sporg!"<br/><br/>That was actually suboptimal tactically -- I think, maybe I'm wrong, but the point is that I privileged the fiction over the tactics. <br/><br/>I'm not sure I can claim this is a solution, because it depends on what the problem is. If the problem is that your group doesn't like long combats, well, adding that layer of strong roleplay may or may not help. If the problem is that your group isn't sure how to weave roleplay into combat, this may help. If your problem is something else entirely, it probably won't help. So I think I'll just classify it as "a thing I do."<br/><br/>Hm. I do have one question about the original post:\n<blockquote>In D&amp;D 4E, an average player (which the storygames crowd doesn't represent) doesn't have enough time to play the game by the rules, play situations that take advantage of those rules (playing 1 encounter doesn't properly test your resources), and still have enough time to engage the game's fiction in any deep way if you only play for 4 hours.</blockquote>\nWhat happens if:<br/><br/>You start a play session at the beginning of the day. You play for four hours; in that time you spend, I dunno, two solid hours on roleplay and two hours on combat. Maybe this is one fight, maybe it's two. Then you note the state of the characters vis a vis resources, and shelve the situation until the next time you play.<br/><br/>I.e., are you assuming that resources must be refreshed at the end of the session? Is this assumption there for a reason I haven't thought of yet?<br/><br/>This is very relevant to me since I've run one 4e game that was highly dungeon-centric, and we saved state as necessary. It worked out fine for us, but it was not a roleplaying-heavy game. I am working up a campaign that will be more or less the opposite, and I've been planning on saving state, but I'm interested in reasons why I might be going in the wrong direction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233542">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233542/#Comment_233542" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-21T17:57:47+00:00" title="September 21, 2009  5:57PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went back through the thread, pulling out things I thought were helpful and easily missed.<br/><br/>Mark W's first post is very true and needs to be conveyed, and I like how value-neutral it is.<br/><br/>kiznit's point is excellent.

Feel free to keep it coming. I'm reading along. <br/><br/>One of the things that fascinates me is different perceptions people have about the game. It isn't that anyone's wrong about it. It's that some people are willing to look at the game differently. Some people drift it. Some don't. Some people give up. Some people don't. <br/><br/>Personally, the thing I find most fascinating is the brand loyalty people have to D&amp;D. It's amazing <i>to me personally</i> how much effort people will put into their hobby to enjoy D&amp;D. And, it's also very interesting to me how much <i>some</i> people are not willing to do that.<br/><br/>I'm not saying either are freaks. (Ok, both are; let your freak flag fly.) I'm saying that a lot goes on in social groups that forces people to find solutions to things. The number of people who seem to be going "by the book" is pretty small. Instead, most people either give up (go to another game entirely, or no game at all) or find ways to make D&amp;D work. And, that last part's totally cool (cool as in awesome AND cool as in totally acceptable).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233667/#Comment_233667" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T11:50:11+00:00" title="September 22, 2009 11:50AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 22, 2009 11:51AM by Ry.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a disconnect between "these two encounters in 3 hours are a session that matters" and "these two encounters in three hours are 2% of what you need to get to the end of the Heroic Tier."  <br/><br/>I'm seriously thinking about doubling the experience rewards so my 2-encounter adventures feel like the big deals that they are.<br/><br/>I fear what will happen now that I have spoken (because some of my players are reading this).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233686/#Comment_233686" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T12:34:32+00:00" title="September 22, 2009 12:34PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now that the DMG2 is out, I'm going pretty much by the book.

Have you read <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9591" rel="nofollow">our extensive AP about the campaign</a>?  Our early play dripped with flavor and characterization.  We were having a grand old time.  But, again and again, we found that engaging with the mechanics took things that should have been fun and rendered them not fun.  I'm actually designing <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/category/snow-queen/" rel="nofollow">a completely different console-inspired game</a> right now based on my frustrations with running 4E.  And that's cool.  I'm not trying to hate on anyone's fun here.  I'm definitely happy that lots of folks are digging 4E.<br/><br/>But my experience was:<br/>1. I never played D&amp;D before 4E. I played some 3.5 with Eric afterwards and I'm not sure it was necessarily better for me.<br/>2. I tried playing/running 4E based on my understanding of the game from the texts.<br/>3. It took way too much work for something that turned out to be inconsistently fun.<br/>4. I'd much rather play Mouse Guard or TSOY or Agon or Danger Patrol if I want something fighty but easier to prep and consistently fun. And that's not just about the slightly-more-abstract fight mechanics, but more that I know how to run them to make them fun.  I don't know how to do that with D&amp;D (of any edition) and the level of investment required to master or hack the system to the point where it could be consistently fun for me just doesn't seem worth it.  I have no real investment in D&amp;D as a tradition and I don't necessarily want to invest in it if it's not going to be something that's easy to get into and delivers at my table (whatever it does at other people's tables).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233834/#Comment_233834" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T08:21:44+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  8:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's hard to take Eric too seriously because everything he ever says sounds pretty angry, but I accept that I was totally wrong about why things didn't work for you guys. I wasn't really criticizing, though -- or at least I didn't mean to -- as much as I was offering theories about why things broke. But Eric and you say I'm wrong, and I won't second-guess that.
