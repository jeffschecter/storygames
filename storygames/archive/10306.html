Why is it boring? Because a crucial dimension of the whole fun about RPGs is missing, namely the moments of personal revelation by one of the players which gives raise to a strong personal connection between the players. So one of the main advantages of role-playing a character seems to be basically an issue of the intensity in which the players connect to each other on a personal level. Role-playing the characters intensifies this kind of connectedness, whereas authoring the characters leads to a detachment between the players.<br/><br/>Firstly I would like to say that I think this line of thought conflates authoring a character with a detached way of participating in the mutual creation of a story. As long as someone is emotionally involved in the ongoing game and as long as his decisions reveal his emotional involvement it is perfectly possible to experience all the personal connectedness between the players that you can ask for.<br/><br/>But apart from the question whether authoring a character decreases the possibilities of a certain kind of personal closeness or not I am really puzzled by a further step in the aforementioned line of thought, namely that the fiction created by authoring the characters is less affecting than it would be if the characters are advocated. In my opinion the quality of a piece of fiction is independent of the relation it bears to its author. If someone creates a great moment while authoring his character I can really enjoy the fiction without my fun being spoiled by thoughts about the way he has created this moment. How could it be different? A cool moment in the fiction is completely encapsulated in the fiction. It does not matter what's going on in the real world (at the table).<br/><br/>In addition (coming back to the level of personal attachment between the players) I can feel really close to the player which came up with a beautiful idea. I think something like: \u201cYeah, great, we have a complete understanding of how to create a great enjoyable story.\u201d A player reveals a lot about himself through the ideas he puts forward for advancing the fiction.<br/><br/>So to summarize: The dramatic quality and the enjoyability of the fiction created during playing an RPG is not in any way directly dependent on an antagonism between the players that is fostered by advocating the characters instead of authoring them. Furthermore the way a player authors his character opens the road for an intense personal connectedness between him and the other players.<br/><br/>This said, I won't deny that introducing an antagonism between the players might be an additional source of emotional involvement and intensity. However, it has it's own costs as well, since as long as a player strictly advocates his character he might throw away great opportunities for making a breathtaking moment in the ongoing fiction.<br/><br/>[I'm not sure whether I should have posted this in the thread about Role-playing Characters vs. Authoring Characters. Of course I comment on a lot of the ideas that have been exchanged there. But I wanted to focus mainly on the effects that different ways of guiding a character have on  the personal connectedness between the players and on the dramatic quality of the fiction \u2013 and since the discussion in the other thread has wandered to different places it seemed justifiable to start a new thread (I'm new here and not yet familiar with your policies of discussion, so please excuse me, if custom has demanded to post this as an answer there).]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229152/#Comment_229152" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T05:49:38+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  5:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jan</cite>But apart from the question whether authoring a character decreases the possibilities of a certain kind of personal closeness or not I am really puzzled by a further step in the aforementioned line of thought, namely that the fiction created by authoring the characters is less affecting than it would be if the characters are advocated.

And really, you don't think <i>anything</i> they're talking about sounds even remotely cool, but clearly they're totally jazzed about it?<br/><br/>I think that's where you see a real difference in the "quality of the fiction" (sort of a dorky term, but oh well) between "authoring experience" and "character advocacy" (even more dorky terms, I wish there was a better way to talk about this stuff).   The "Let me tell you about my character" crowd is often totally grooving on character advocacy, and to them, it makes their game the most awesome thing that has ever been done anywhere.  There's something special that happened to those people when they were playing that game which simply cannot be reproduced or related to people who were not playing with them at the time.  For the people in that game, the quality of the fiction was huge, they were completely in tune with what was going on and blown away by the experience; for the guy hearing about it secondhand, the same is not true.<br/><br/>And I think when advocacy-loving people come at their game from an "authoring" perspective, it can be harder to get that special experience.  It sometimes makes for a better story after the fact, but it's less personal to them; they're deliberately standing outside the whole participation mystique that comes with getting into character in order to get their "authoring" mojo working.  Other people more fond of "authoring" probably skew the other way, getting a bigger charge out of standing outside and feeling like they're missing something important when they stay in character.<br/><br/>At any rate, the cool moments are not completely encapsulated by the fiction: they are frequently encapsulated in the <i>experience of playing the game</i>, which is an experience that exists outside the fiction.  If you weren't there, if you didn't play it, those moments might not seem cool at all.  The cool moments are relative to <i>what you enjoy</i> and <i>what you were part of</i>, not something an outsider can point to reliably and say "yes, it is clear that this moment was undeniably and absolutely cool."\n<blockquote>So to summarize: The dramatic quality and the enjoyability of the fiction created during playing an RPG is not in any way directly dependent on an antagonism between the players that is fostered by advocating the characters instead of authoring them.</blockquote>\nI have no idea where you're getting "antagonism between the players" from.

If understood correctly advocating your character boils down to taking the perspective of your character, get a grip on what's important for, what he wants to achieve etc. and than put forth an effort to make him happy (or whatever it is that he aspires). In other words it is required that the player acts on behalf of his character (i.e. tries to win conflicts in the game etc.). (Please correct me, if I'm wrong.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br>And I think when advocacy-loving people come at their game from an "authoring" perspective, it can be harder to get that special experience.

Why couldn't someone who is authoring his character be as excited as any advocacy player? In fact, I really enjoyed losing conflicts, for example in PtA, because I thought that the consequences will deepen the narrative. And afterwards I was really excited and told others about how cool it was (and probaly they were not even remotly as excited as I have been). So, the point I'm trying to make is that authoring your character is no obstacle to an intense experience. And I'm not convinced that the intensity has to be lower compared to advocacy.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>At any rate, the cool moments are not completely encapsulated by the fiction: they are frequently encapsulated in the<i>experience of playing the game</i>, which is an experience that exists outside the fiction.

The cool moments are relative to<i>what you enjoy</i>and<i>what you were part of</i>, not something an outsider can point to reliably and say "yes, it is clear that this moment was undeniably and absolutely cool."</blockquote>\nI concede, that the cool moments of playing the game are not in the fiction - after all they are in the experience of the players. But what I still believe is that one dimension of the fun of roleplaying is enjoying a good narrative. And with respect to this dimension it's possible to solely focus on how cool the fiction is (or how good or whatever your favourite evaluative concept is). So, you are right in pointing out that I put a little bit to much emphasize on the fiction conceived of as something that is quite enjoyable all by itself. However, I'm convinced that the coolness of what's going on at the fictional level can be evaluated without looking at the process by which it has been produced. I think that it is often forgotten that roleplaying has this dimension of following a narrative which is compareable to reading a book or watching a movie. Of course there is much more to story games than being a spectator.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><br/>I have no idea where you're getting "antagonism between the players" from.

I thought that advocating your charater's interests might be important because it produces a kind of tension between the players that could best be understood in terms of taking different sides in a conflict. (I want my character to achieve his goals and some of the other players are introducing obstacles which I have to overcome ...) But probably that's off the mark.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite><br/>This I 100% agree with.  The issue being criticised is really people who play from a detached emotional state.

Some folks plug into story by character, and for these folks, it is the tight identification with character and the character's situation that gives them enjoyment.  Some folks (like myself and presumably you) plug in elsewhere \u2014 via plot or setting or even structure.  To us, that tight identification is not necessary for enjoyment (and can, in fact, detract from that enjoyment).  Mo Turkington talks about this sort of stuff with her socket theory.<br/><br/>The identify-exclusively-with-character approach is becoming more and more associated with Story Now in a rather negative and One True Way sort of fashion, which is a shame.  It's one way up the mountain.  Or, alternately, because I like labels, I'd be fine if this approach became the definition of Story Now, because then we'd have a label to point to when we're talking about this sort of stuff.  As it is, all we've got is the slow-simmering crusade of what's "good" and what's "not so good because it doesn't do what I do," and that's bollocks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229219/#Comment_229219" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T09:53:43+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  9:53AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I completely understand all the dimensions of this debate, but it seems to me that there are some parallels to the divide in fiction writing between "organic" or "discovery" writers and "outline" writers. For the discovery writer, the idea of figuring out the story ahead of time robs them of interest in the story, because what gets them excited is the in-the-moment surprises of seeing how their characters would react to situations and how those things spin the story in new directions. The outliner, on the other hand, wants to make sure there's a good, engaging story happening for their characters to experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229262/#Comment_229262" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T12:04:00+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 12:04PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesus, I always play detached from my characters, because that means it's <i>funny</i> when they screw up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229267/#Comment_229267" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T12:10:22+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 12:10PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Jesus, I always play detached from my characters, because that means it's<i>funny</i>when they screw up.</blockquote>\nAccording to a number of current threads, you're not really a roleplayer, JD.

They can contribute as much to the hardship of their own characters as they want.  You're a KGB operative? It's totally kosher to narrate how a CIA agent just blew your cover.  Similarly non-Principle players are free to help your guy out.  They can totally say something like, "But the CIA agent decides to stay quiet about it for now."<br/><br/>However!  Once a conflict is established the game moves to different phase called Flashpoints.  In Flashpoints, Principle players MUST narrate how the Principles advance their interests and non-Principles MUST narrate how external forces work against those interests.<br/><br/>All anyone, has every been saying is that it's kind of boring when all the players are standing on one side of the fiction which is kind of an inflated version of the Czege Principle.  Something, somewhere, in a conflict, must "stand up" for the interests of Party A and someone, somewhere must "stand up" for the interests of Party B.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229440/#Comment_229440" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T19:09:56+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  7:09PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>All anyone, has every been saying is that it's kind of boring when all the players are standing on one side of the fiction which is kind of an inflated version of the Czege Principle.</blockquote>\nIf all the players are aligned on the the same side of the ficttion, then presumably there is no conflict at that point.\n<blockquote>Something, somewhere, in a conflict, must "stand up" for the interests of Party A and someone, somewhere must "stand up" for the interests of Party B.<br/></blockquote>\nWhich is fine, but why limit that to characters? <br/><br/>What exactly is the problem of having Party A and Party B in your formulation refer to the players and their ideas about the course of a conflict, rather than to the characters?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229473">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229473/#Comment_229473" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T22:42:52+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:42PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert,<br/><br/>No.  It's possible that there is a conflict within the fiction: Drak The Bold is facing off with Naxus the Wicked in a duel to the death.  But for the players to be all aligned on one side: The players just agree that Drak should kick Naxus's ass.<br/><br/>What this says is that no one is really invested in either of the characters as passionate thematic forces in their own right.  Instead the group is invested in the story as an artifact and are working to make sure it turns out "right."  This all by itself is not a bad thing.  But it sets the stage for something I think is problematic.<br/><br/>Consider there is no conflict in the fiction, yet.  Instead someone says, "I think Drak should be kidnapped by Naxus."  And someone else says "No.  I think he should be seduced by Morgana the Exotic!"  Not ONLY have we lost Drak as a passionate thematic entity but we have an actual honest to god real-world conflict among the real players.  Two players are socially bear wrestling for the story as an artifact to be manipulated and owned.  This can get subtle.  Drak and Naxus are facing off, so conflict!  Player A: "I think Drak should kill Naxus!"  Player B: "I think Drak should take Naxus prisoner!"  But again no one is considering the motivations of the characters AS characters, they're just bear wrestling for the PLOT outcome they prefer.<br/><br/>I do not condone this behavior.  There are probably games which have this struggle as a formalized arena of social competition but in those cases the design has other motors to promote this in a socially healthy way.  Outside of such formal competitive agreements I find this behavior childish and rude.<br/><br/>I'm sorry but that's just what I think.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jan" title="Jan"><img alt="Jan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://api.ning.com/files/aMCvJWa*119KpxWfJKRX3wq*4TaoGdbPDFLD2u-xwv3UxkjerE6mt2*bPXjTPEakxlyfWEOhLHh83PvGpr4dR0WqgIT-CrY4/madmansig.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;crop=1%3A1"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jan">Jan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229491/#Comment_229491" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T00:04:56+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 12:04AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 12:05AM by Jan.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to understand two things better. First, what it the surplus of having <i>players</i> taking different sides in a conflict? The second question is related to the first question since it presuposes that there really are good reasons for this kind of taking sides. The question is than, why should it be important that the players side with characteres as opposed for example voting for different narrative developments?<br/><br/>The second question was already asked by komradebob:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite><br/>[...]<br/>Which is fine, but why limit that to characters?<br/><br/>What exactly is the problem of having Party A and Party B in your formulation refer to the players and their ideas about the course of a conflict, rather than to the characters?</blockquote>\nBut before exploring this question let me address the first question: why is taking sides at all a benefit for the whole roleplaying-experience? I guess that there are basically two reasons (and both of them have been more or less mentioned before). First, it introduces a moment of uncertainty into the game. When someone advocates A and somene else advocates B we have a moment of tension and it's exciting to see what will happen. So I guess that taking sides can be cool because it introduces uncertainty, tension and excitement into the game. Secondly, something that has been fought for seems to have an additional value. You can't take this thing for granted. Someone had to put forth an effort to introduce it into the fiction - and there have been obstacles to overcome. Regarding this consideration having different sides in a conflict passes importance to the outcome of the conflict. If it was worth fighting for it has to be of some value. I think that something like this second consideration is at the center of the idea that without advocacy the game will be boring.<br/><br/>However, it seems a far cry from the idea that some sort of tension between the players can produce a more intense experience to the claim that what is really needed is character advocacy. Why should this be the case? It seems to me that there is no good reason to suppose that the aforementioned benefits of taking sides are only there when the sides a characters. In this respect I completly agree with komradebob.<br/><br/>And Jesse, I think that you are not answering komrad bob's question here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite><br/>[...] What this says is that no one is really invested in either of the characters as passionate thematic forces in their own right.  Instead the group is invested in the story as an artifact and are working to make sure it turns out "right."  This all by itself is not a bad thing.  But it sets the stage for something I think is problematic.<br/></blockquote>\nAs I understood him he was not talking about conflict on a fictional level but about a conflict between the players in which they take sides not necessarily with their character but maybe with something else. At least this is what I think can happen as I pointed out above.<br/><br/>Another strange argument that has been put forward here and also at othter places goes roughly like this: if the players are not advocating their characters but are instead focusing on the development of the narrative, an ugly power struggle is the inevitable consequence. Why? Because as soon as they have different ideas about how to advance the story they can just rely on more or less subtle means of manipulation, coercion or what have you. But that doesn't sound right for mainly two reasons. First, when they are not able to solve their conflicts in this context in a reasonable way there is nothing that prevents them from failing in other contexts as well, i. e. when they are advocating their characters. Why should someone mutate to a badass only when he has different ideas of how to advance the story but not when he fights for his character's interests? Secondly there can be rules of how to solve conflicts about what should happen next. (Probaly I'm misunderstanding something pretty essential about the alleged problem.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229547">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229547/#Comment_229547" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T07:08:07+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  7:08AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps I'm misunderstanding Jesse, but what I'm getting from your last post is this:<br/><br/>If I'm playing for overall story development more than the fictional entity's wants, then I'm either being dispassaionate, and the story falls apart from too much agreement, or, I do start playing passionately for the overalll story and immediately become a jerk.<br/><br/>See, ehere's the thing I think I'm disconnecting on: Even assuming I'm playing mostly for direction of plot, why would I ignore the very nature of the characters?<br/><br/>I mean, generally, no matter how folks approach things, there's going to be some sort of interesting characters, no? Well okay, we'll hope so. And interesting enough characters that more than one player will be interested in them.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I've pretty much had the opposite experience to yourself I think, in that I find that games where I can choose to act as a real person and use not just a single character but all sorts of fictional elements tend to produce results with less real world conflict, more sharing of ideas, and generally just more surprising and enjoyable results.<br/><br/>I am curious how you see GM duties fitting with your formulation of Character Advocacy Primacy, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229630/#Comment_229630" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T11:23:13+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 11:23AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 11:25AM by Jesse.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Robert,<br/><br/>The GM advocates for the things that are not the PCs.  This is how games like Sorcerer and Burning Wheel work.  The way those games become about the characters is that we establish the PCs first.  Most specifically we establish the things the PCs value and want.  Then the GM simply establishes what all the NPCs want in ways that intersect with what the PCs want in interesting (not necessarily adversarial though it can be) ways.  Then once that establishing is done, we hit the "Go" button and it's advocating all the way.<br/><br/>However, I should point out that, that establishing phase can be returned to, even on scene-by-scene basis.  This can get quite chatty and collaborative.  Advocacy only kicks in once we've hit the "Go" button.  Okay, now that we understand what the here-and-now situation is what do the characters *do*, here-and-now.  Is that a conflict?  If yes.. what do the *characters* want out of the conflict?  Okay, roll dice to see if they get it.<br/><br/>That's why I'm not very keen on Pauls original word "authoring."   Because to me, this IS authoring the character.  We've made giving the player's the opportunity to author their character's actions and decisions over the things those characters value the primary activity of play.<br/><br/>The more important distinction is this.  The above, to me, is "authoring the character."  The thing Paul was talking about is more accurately described as "authoring at the players."  In the former the player is merely demonstrating the thematic energy of the character and reserving emotional impact to the judgment of the observer.  In the later the player is deliberately trying to provoke specific and calculated emotions by attempting to control key plot points in the fiction or by deliberately heaping on soap operatic levels of "stuff" to provoke a reaction.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
