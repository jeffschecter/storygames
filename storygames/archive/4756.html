I really like Cold City, and I know it well enough that I could maybe make somethig=ng comprehensive and attuned to the game a little. Also, I know the guy who wrote it and he said he didn't mind. I've even started doodling some poster ideas, see<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/7925471@N03/1894725487/" rel="nofollow">The Russian</a> here(how do you link in files from flickr? Should I be using Photobucket?)<br/><br/>But I've also had another idea, for a version of It Was A Mutual Decision based on all those great films where the guy and the girl travel together through fantasy worlds and go on quests and eventually realise their love for each other, break the curse and live happily ever after. The Princess Bride, Stardust, Legend, all those kinds of stories. It would have a kick ass convention demo structure, lovely lovely cover art designed to appeal to males and females, (and probably rip off Stardust a little) and could be supported with setting ideas, a story telling forum and just the prettiest darned character sheets you ever did see (whilst remaining simple enough to be almost a party game).<br/><br/>Which should I do?

I'd also considered a series of forum posts, scattered around various board but linking to each other, diarising the exploits and opinions of the team members. Story Games might get the Russian, RPG.net the American, Collective Endeavour the Brit, etc etc. Bring in the supernatural aspect a little harder.<br/><br/>Then, I'd have to start addressing real-world aspects. The book itself, the web support, the future of the line or the means by which the buzz, once created, would be maintained.

So no, I'm not looking for a complete do-over. The way I figure it, he main changes a lot of story games need to make them generally marketable are to do with wording and layout, but the basic concept is sound. Its just making that concept seem appealing that's the issue.<br/><br/>Cold City is hard because, as a wierdo alternate history game, its hard to sell to non-gamers/sci-fi/fantasy geeks. My main aim, therefore, will be to move the game out of the hard core Indie market, and onto the shelves and tables of gamers all around the world. Break open the game concepts in the most awesome-o-fied manner possible, and see how many WoD players I can get to put down the crack-addled Changeling supplements and use their d10s for something worthwhile.<br/><br/>But we'll see. If the game can't support it, I'd happily look at what could be done, superficially, to make it into something that can be sold more widely. For instance, bigger, more setting included. And there are some ideas floating around re minor tweaks to the system which I'd probably pick up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
