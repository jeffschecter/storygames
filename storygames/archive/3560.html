(Write a "foreign" campaign setting in 1000 words that doesn't promote stereotypes or racism?) Because it certainly smells like one.<br/><br/>CHALLENGE!  Describe a real-world culture/civilization/whatchamacallit in 1,000 words or less, for the purposes of a role-playing game.  <br/><br/>1.  You don't have to be a member of the culture/civilization/whatever, but that should be clear in your entry. <br/>2.  But you damn sure better not promote racism, stereotypes, or engage in all that post-imperial bullshit.<br/>3.  You also better not cater to fanboy stereotypes, to the extent it can be avoided.<br/>4.  Your facts, to the extent you include facts, should be accurate, though I'm fine with some fuzziness.<br/>5.  No subcultures, no tiny little regional group, no ethnic sub-groups.  I'm talking, like, "China."  <br/>5A.  Yep, 1000 words.<br/>5B.  The absurdity of the project is assumed; you don't have to apologize or defend your sketch.<br/>6.  You can pick a historical period, though, including Modern Day ___________.<br/>7.

I have met one Eyak in my whole life.  <br/><br/><b>Introduction</b><br/><br/>The Eyak are a coastal people living in the Copper River delta of southcentral Alaska.  They are sandwiched between three aggressive and populous neighbors, the Tlingit to the south, the Ahtna to the north, and the Alutiiq to the west.  <br/><br/><b>Social Organization</b><br/><br/>The Eyak are a small, matrilineal society numbering only a few thousand members.  There are two clans \xe2\u20ac\u201c Eagle and Raven, and they are exogamous \xe2\u20ac\u201c Eagles marry Ravens, and vice-versa.  Lineage, and territorial and property rights, are traced through mothers, and children take their mother\xe2\u20ac\u2122s family name.  Each clan maintains a house in every village.  This organization is considerably simpler than that of their Ahtna and Tlingit neighbors, who each have two moieties but many clans.  This tends to lead to confusion and hostility, and causes problems with inter-marriage.<br/><br/>Status is afforded to various families based on tradition and wealth.  High status families own property and often employ low status workers and slaves.  Slaves are generally captives taken in war, and they are quite rare \xe2\u20ac\u201c the Eyak are more often the victims of raids than the perpetrators.  Status groups marry within their own.  Sometimes a low-status Eyak man will save up a huge pile of resources and, with the help of family, host a huge potlatch to raise his own status.  He\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll then quickly marry a high status woman, and his children\xe2\u20ac\u2122s future is assured.  This process can also happen in reverse, when a high status man falls in love with a low status woman or a slave.  <br/><br/>Clans and high status individuals have historical rights to particular streams, river access points, and beaches.  These are often aggressively defended and hotly contested.  Old grudges constantly simmer across Eyak society, and they almost always begin as property disputes.  <br/><br/>There is no central coordinating body \xe2\u20ac\u201c villages and, in some cases, village clans or even families make local decisions.  There are informal provisions for common defense, but every clan decides for itself what action to take.  Because clan loyalty is complicated by marriage and status, decision-making is typically a drawn-out process unless a threat is transparently obvious.  <br/><br/><b>Settlements</b><br/><br/>Eyak live in clan groups of around twenty, in villages of perhaps 300.  <br/><br/>In the summer, most Eyak move to fish camps and follow the salmon upriver.  Winter dwellings are made from cedar and spruce planks with shingled roofs and central smoke holes above a fire-pit.  Protection from enemies and weather, as well as access to fresh water and salmon-bearing streams, determines the location of permanent settlements.  Villages consist of a single row of clan dwellings facing the water, book-ended by clan houses where feasts, communal activities like net making, and feasts and potlatches take place.  <br/><br/><b>Tech</b><br/><br/>Living in a temperate rainforest, the Eyak have plentiful access to wood, and wood is the central feature of their technology.  Dwellings, canoes, and even clothing is made from wood (beaten and woven cedar bark, in the case of clothing).  Ceremonial items, hand tools and jewelry are also made from wood.  Sweet-smelling cedar mats are used as floor coverings.<br/><br/>When Eyak fight, they use heavy clubs studded with beaver teeth, barbed spears, and vicious harpoons smeared with aconite.  They have a reputation for being clever warriors, striking without warning and setting traps that employ tripwires and deadfalls to cover their retreat.  The fact that young Eyak men hunt bears earns them a measure of respect, particularly from the Ahtna.  <br/><br/>Light sources include seal oil and ooligan, small fish so oily they can be lit like candles.  Woven baskets are piled high everywhere, holding everything from dentalium trade goods to dried bull kelp.  Animal bone and fur is used extensively, as are valuable artifacts made of Ahtna copper.  The Eyak live comfortably.<br/><br/><b>Food</b><br/><br/>The Eyak have a rich seasonal round that relies heavily on salmon.  Harvesting salmon involves considerable innovation \xe2\u20ac\u201c elaborate fish weirs and holding ponds are constructed, as well as all manner of nets, spears, and hooks.  The salmon run in such astonishing profusion that catching them isn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t as challenging as processing, preserving, and storing them.  Sea mammals, intertidal organisms, seaweed, berries, birds and their eggs, and mountain game like deer supplement the fish-heavy diet.  Although they are a maritime people, the mountains above to the Copper River are also their home, and they hunt and trap throughout them \xe2\u20ac\u201c even trapping bears.  <br/><br/><b>The Potlatch</b><br/><br/>High status Eyak, like their Tlingit neighbors, hold potlatches, which are social events designed to display conspicuous wealth and cement or elevate status.  Potlatches are event-driven, coinciding with births, funerals, victories in battle, or an auspicious date honoring a dead ancestor.  Potlatches are complex multi-day affairs that include feasts, speech-making, contests, and the display and squandering of wealth.  The wealthiest Eyak might shatter copper artifacts, burn valuable tools, or even murder slaves to display their social power.  Guests at potlatches are expected to reciprocate, each according to his ability.  <br/><br/><b>Neighbors</b><br/><br/>The Ahtna are known as the \xe2\u20ac\u0153copper diggers\xe2\u20ac\x9d.  They live in the mountains and are the source of all local copper, which is a precious commodity to the Eyak, Alutiiq, and Tlingit.  The Eyak often find themselves serving as middle-men, buying and selling Ahtna copper.  The Ahtna themselves have a reputation for violence and are greatly feared.<br/><br/>The Aluutiq are a true maritime people inhabiting Prince William Sound.  They are rapidly expanding, and are experts as seaborne movement and navigation by baidarka and kayak.  Aluutiq raiding parties are a frequent terror along the Eyak coast.  They are the most foreign of the Eyak\xe2\u20ac\u2122s neighbors \xe2\u20ac\u201c strangers from the west who wear the skin of birds.  <br/><br/>The Tlingit speak a language that is easy for the Eyak to learn, and they are strong trading partners, eager for Ahtna copper.  They have little respect for the tiny Eyak nation, however, considering them cowards, and Tlingit are easily offended.  Culturally they are very similar, which is a blessing and a curse.  They outnumber the Eyak fifty to one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80242/#Comment_80242" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T11:06:15+00:00" title="July  9, 2007 11:06AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 9, 2007 11:07AM by John_Harper.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is fantastic, Jason.

But hey, I'm soft.)<br/><br/>The reason I wanted big, broad stuff is because that's how this material is usually presented in RPG supplements.  Instead of material devoted to the Eyak or one of their equally worthy neighbors, your game store carries <i>Teepees &amp; Tomahawks - Peoples of America Culture Supplement</i>--with 50 pages devoted to spells, 20 pages to monsters, and maybe 3 pages of anything resembling cultural information that's actually useful at the table.<br/><br/>If we're going to sit in judgment on the imaginary authors of <i>Teepees &amp; Tomahawks</i>, I think we should appreciate the difficulty of that design spec: "Hey, explain an entire civilization, including numerous subgroups with almost nothing in common, in three pages. And make it respectful!"  <i>Teepees &amp; Tomahawks</i> is lame, but by definition it must be lame: the only question is how to make it the least-lame it can be.<br/><br/>So, the Eyak stuff isn't quite on point.

Totally anecdotal here, but I suspect more than that and either play bogs down completely, or players redact/forget stuff to get it down to a more handy size.\n<blockquote>2) I think it's also worthwhile to question that entire premise.

I know nothing about the role-playing game industry, but it sounds like people thought it made more sense to create one $30 book than thirty $1 books.  And then, since a lot of your fans are people who want to see monsters and magic systems and weapons, rather than read an anthropology treatise, your cultural info section is going to be pretty small--especially if there's a limit to how much people can meaningfully process.

Rule 5B is all well and good, but I think it's worth noting that this is an absurd and <i>potentially harmful</i> notion.  Writing cultures is a language of power.  It's saying "this is authentic" and "this is not authentic", it's creating "otherness", and it's presenting dynamic, fluid and temporary communities as monolithic, static and permanent.  Cultures are contradictory, experiential, and possibly non-existant.  Writing cultures is impossible, in one or a hundred thousand words.  They don't work like that.

Writing about other cultures is absurd<br/>2.  And it's all we have.<br/><br/>Simon, I completely agree with your comments and concerns; I share them.  At the same time if we are paralyzed by these concerns, then it becomes impossible to converse about culture at all.  I believe that having dialogues about culture (by playing Story Games, for us folks) is very important, and I hope embarking on a necessary and useful task can compensate for unavoidable or well-meant flaws in execution.<br/><br/>Naturally I say this as a member of an absurdly over-privileged group, but if other people are offended by this challenge they're welcome to do it better.  And I will fully support those efforts, because it's worth doing.  But I do think the effort should be made by someone, somehow.  To not engage in it, is to confess we can never understand one another--if that's the case, we might as well go back to the caves.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80325/#Comment_80325" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T19:41:38+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  7:41PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.  I think this is a pretty difficult subject.  I think that story games can be a really great way of exploring cultures, precisely because they expose the way cultures are shifting, negotiated, and temporary.  They make cultures about people, rather than generalisations.  They expose stories, rather than stereotypes.  They also make little claim to "authenticity", which I think is a valuable standpoint.  I guess that what I see with this project is a move away from what is so great about how story games can explore culture, and a move towards the more violent definition of (old fashioned) anthropology.  In other words, this challenge is kind of doing the exact opposite of what I think would be most valuable.  I think a cooler way to structure this challenge would be to take advantage of some of the awesome tools provided by story games.  For example, writing a relationship map that explores issues of power and status in an Eyak village.  Writing some TSoY Keys that portray masculinity in New Zealand culture.  Heck, even writing some demons for Sorcerer that represent the old culture of Japan conflicting with the new.  Cultures, like story games, are built on conflicts.  I'd like to see that represented here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80330/#Comment_80330" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-09T21:27:20+00:00" title="July  9, 2007  9:27PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote> I think a cooler way to structure this challenge would be to take advantage of some of the awesome tools provided by story games.</blockquote>\nWorking on it.

I believe that delivering a proper picture of American culture, of which I am a native member, or of Japanese culture, into which I was a transplant, in so few words is beyond my ability. Thus, I present the following:<br/><br/>---------------------------<br/><br/>When I was living in Japan, one of my professors, an American, asked his wife, a Japanese, to deliver a lecture for a class he was teaching on Japanese culture. The structure of the class was such that we would read an essay or paper by a particular scholar on a rather narrow topic, such as the debate over "weak legal consciousness" in Japan, and then the author or another scholar in the field would be invited to visit the University and speak. A goodly number accepted, which was rather nice. This professor's wife was a linguistics specialist, if I recall correctly, and she was to give a lecture related to a recent reading on "deep Japanese culture" - culture as perceived and experienced on a fundamental and essentially unconscious level by insiders of the culture (a mountain of a subject, to be sure). She delivered a lecture on some extremely specific and narrow topics in Japanese linguistics, making no reference to the subject beyond stating it in the title. <br/><br/>On a later occasion, I was speaking with this professor, and this event came up. He mentioned that he had been surprised by the apparent mismatch between the topic and the lecture that his wife had delivered. Her reply (and I must apologize here, for I cannot help but recall his telling of it as being more illuminating than the pale reflection I am offering) was that she had approached the topic as directly as she could - that the material she had lectured on was, in her expertise as a linguist, as close to "deep Japanese culture" as she could imagine. She did not feel it appropriate to draw conclusions linking this material to the lecture's stated subject matter. Rather, she thought it best to present the example that she had in mind, and then to trust that those in the audience with the necessary background would draw the proper conclusions and connections on their own. Those who lacked the proper background would not benefit from hearing the conclusions.<br/><br/>With this in mind, I present a link to <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1994/oe-lecture.html" rel="nofollow">Kenzaburo Oe's Nobel Prize lecture</a>. I read it shortly after reading Oe's <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=qLxbAqnc-cwC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq&amp;source=web&amp;ots=5804hAnE-M&amp;sig=3Ifv1Amee0W4UEArflDVfk62rBE#PPA11,M1" rel="nofollow">Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids</a>. Please read it as a few words by a man of great skill describing a particular facet of his experience, and take from it whatever your background allows. For those of you who prefer voice to text, please note the link to the audio recording at the top of the lecture.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80435/#Comment_80435" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T14:40:18+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  2:40PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Writing some TSoY Keys that portray masculinity in New Zealand culture</blockquote>\nKey of She'll Be Right, Mate: <br/>Gain 1 XP when you express possibly unwarranted optimism.<br/>Gain 3 XP when you treat a significant task as trivial.<br/><br/>It's actually more difficult than it looks at first.

I'm working on my own thing for NZ, a Sorcerer supplement where the demons are long buried secrets from the past.  Kind of like "The Sentinal", which is the creepiest movie I've ever seen.  It's very much about pakeha New Zealand though.  I think the key (?) to the Keys would be to make them a little broader, and to think hard about the counters, as well.  I guess the reason I think Keys are a better way of doing it is because it doesn't assume masculinity is the same for everyone, and it presents it as a series of (possibly) conflicting goals and motivations, which is more useful, I think.  But you're right, pinning down those Keys is super hard.  Here's my own take on your Key of She'll Be Right, Mate, which I think is an awesome idea:<br/>\n<br/>\nGain 1 XP when you avoid dealing with a problem.<br/>\nGain 3 XP when you deal with a problem by yourself, when outside help is available.<br/>\nCounter: Allow someone else to significantly help you with a problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like it this way, because it captures the reticence to talk about emotional issues, as well as accepting help with physical tasks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80487/#Comment_80487" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-10T19:08:57+00:00" title="July 10, 2007  7:08PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You see?

I've entered in most of that online, missing some of the long coverage of law and justice.  <br><br><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/race/kara-tur-life.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/race/kara-tur-life.html</a><br><br>I'll quote the sections on manners below as a sample:\n<blockquote><b>Manners</b><br/>The people of Kara-Tur, it is noticed by gajin, are extraordinarily polite as a rule.  They often go to meticulous pain to behave in the correct manner.  Indeed, among the higher classes, incorrect or poor manners is virtually as great a crime as murder and severe punishments can be levied upon those who knowingly or unknowingly commit some social <i>faux pas</i>.  Correct manners mark clearly the differences between various social classes and, perhaps more importantly, help prevent the possibility of embarrassing oneself in public.  This latter is of great importance, since there is perhaps no greater sin than to be laughed at by others.<br/><br/>The bow is the most obvious expression of manners.  It is not just a way of saying "Hello."  It measures the respect one has for the person bowed to.  Those of lower status bow lower to their superiors than their superiors do to them.  Indeed, a high ranking official may barely nod to those under him.  The greatest deference one can make is to kowtow -- kneel and touch one's head to the floor.  This is normally done only in the presence of emperors and extremely powerful lords, but is sometimes necessary when apologizing to or begging forgivenes from another.  Except in the presence of a powerful lord, kowtowing is an extreme act, since it represents the debasement and surrender of the person to another.<br/><br/>Manners also extend to what one says to another person.  Statements, even when spoken in jest, can be insulting and offensive.  Comments about another person's honor, courage, dislikes, fears, family, dress, behavior, friends, and even his possessions can be cause for insult.  Insults are seldom taken lightly.  Truly generous people might be able to ignore one or two words spoken in jest, but even they would surely not be able to abide more.  Therefore, to prevent insults, conversations are often stilted or phrased in extremely polite terms to avoid offence. <br/><br/>It is the great concern over insults to honor and the risk of public ridicule that prompts so much of the politeness.  Thus, the DM is allowed to cause player characters to lose honor when they do things that would bring them ridicule or make them look foolish.  Player characters cannot be cavalier in their attitude, they must be careful of all they do and say.</blockquote> </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80956/#Comment_80956" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T13:52:13+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  1:52PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Call me crazy, but that segment seems to describe medieval Europe just as well as anything else...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80957">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80957/#Comment_80957" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-12T13:52:42+00:00" title="July 12, 2007  1:52PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>There are two clans \xe2\u20ac\u201c Eagle and Raven, and they are exogamous \xe2\u20ac\u201c Eagles marry Ravens, and vice-versa.</blockquote>\nHey, I get to be a stickler!
