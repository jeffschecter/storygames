                    Hey friends, I'd love a little feedback on a tough nut I'm trying to crack.  I'm also cracking it over at <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=22552" rel="nofollow">The Forge</a>.  So in Grey Ranks, you've got Missions, which are collective - everybody has a little Vignette in which they further the mission and contribute a die to a group pool.  Higher is better but you have a limited set to work with.  Just prior to the final player's Vignette, somebody rolls all the dice to see if the team wins or loses, overall, and the final player gets to wrap that result into his narration.  These Vignettes are all talk - you can invoke anything, include anyone, do whatever within the broad context of moving the Mission forward as framed.  At the end somebody (the Leader guy who framed the overall Mission) gets to single out the Weak Link and punish them, using whatever criteria he likes.  So it's all a bit loosey-goosey, and that's OK (trust me).  But I want to encourage a little tension between characters, and I want the Leader to have some guidance about who to pick on as Weak Link.  So here's my thought:<br/><br/>The size of the die you contribute to the Mission pool influences the color of your narration.  The higher the die size (and the more helpful), the more you have to fuck things up.<br/><br/>If a player contributes a d4, their Mission Vignette must include some collective triumph.  Something goes right for the entire crew, and there is a noteworthy group accomplishment toward the overall Mission goal.<br/><br/>If a player contributes a d6, their Mission Vignette must include some personal success.  Their particular moment in the spotlight should go well, and their character should achieve something worthwhile.<br/><br/>If a player contributes a d8, their Mission Vignette must include some personal failure.  Something goes wrong and it is their fault, or some task in their care is neglected.<br/><br/>If a player contributes a d10 or d12, their Mission Vignette must include some disaster for the crew.  Something very unpleasant happens, or something tragic, or otherwise heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Thus the more helpful you are mechanically, the more hardship you cause, and the more likely you'll be seen as the Weak Link.  Which will encourage you to shirk.  Which will make everybody hate you.  So my question is - does the "your narration must include" seem tiresome, or overly restrictive, or like narrativist hand-holding?  I'm too close to it to tell.                </div>

                            I like it, particularly the idea of trading a bigger mechanical effect for a narrative disadvantage - you want big dice, you gotta suffer.

This is where I start to question it. Here's an example - our mission is to somehow stop an advancing tank column.<br/>We've got, say, four players. Player 1 put a d10 in and the mission started off with heartbreak: as we were leaving the hospital we'd been hiding out at, artillery fire started a fire nearby - we had to keep to the mission and left our friends to burn. That was bad. Player 2 gives his vignette, and gives a d4: collective triumph - we hear over our radios that the fire's been put out - we're exhultant!  Player 3 gives a d8 and includes the fact that his guy left the radio while we were celebrating and now we're without communications. Now player 4 (who gets to decide weakest link anyway and it sure as hell won't be him) throws in another d10 - some of our compatriots (not in the party) are slaughtered because they didn't know, and we could no longer tell them, that they were in harms way. <br/><br/>Weakest link? Player 3, hands down. The collective badness with a d10 is collective, and although its that Player's fault, I think the tendency will be to punish Characters, whose worst contribution comes as a d8.  See what I'm saying? Or is my example not quite right with gameplay?                        </div>

                            Thanks, guys.  <br/><br/>Mike, I'll contact you soon.<br/><br/>Dave, you raise a good point - maybe it should be:<br/><br/>d4 = personal success<br/>d6 = collective success<br/>d8 = collective failure<br/>d10 = personal failure<br/><br/>I'll think on that.  In play it won't be a huge issue, because it is explicit that the Leader gets to use any criteria he likes for deciding the Weak Link - maybe his character is jealous of somebody and picks on them, or maybe the player wants to put another player in a tricky spot.  He can always say "Janek, you saved our bacon out there, but you took foolish risks.  Weak Link."  So the narration and die size contribution is just something to stimulate and guide the Vignette.                        </div>

                            Feel free to ignore me if I'm missing something obvious here, I'm only trying to be helpful, but my first thought upon reading this was thus:<br/><br/>When we played Grey Ranks with you, the standard by which we seemed to choose the weakest link was who contributed the smallest die and therefore helped the least in attempting to complete the mission.  Now, with making the act of giving the higher die not as good for the group because it causes a failure for the group in the narrative, doesn't it sort of average everyone out where big die + collective failure is roughly equal to small die + personal success (but _no_collective_failure_).  I think it would make it harder for me to tell who the weakest link is.  <br/><br/>And if I've elected to play Grey Ranks, I don't think I'd be too upset by depressing narration, because that's what I'd be expecting, and if another player was really screwing us over in the narrative, bully for him.  That's what I paid for.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I really like the idea of the type of narration being dictated by the die size, but I would reverse it so that the d4 plus the narration that went with it really, really screwed the group making that guy the obvious weakest link.<br/><br/>I'm just rambling and probably contradicting myself, so please feel free to ignore me Jason.  I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.                        </div>

                            Although I like the idea that the larger the mechanic contribution, the larger the narrative disadvantage,<br/>I would trade the mechanical effect for a number of dice or a bonus on the die result rather than a change in die size.  Rolling a larger is not nearly as useful, in most systems, as rolling several smaller dice.  I'm not entirely certain of your roll mechanics, but it seems that it would be sucky to take a personal disaster to roll a "1" on that d12.                        </div>

                            Thanks for the input!<br/><br/>Sophie, the die mechanic is pretty solid at this point.  The big die/sucky roll phenomena is more benefit than drawback, the way the game is structured.<br/><br/>Shane, I see your perspective, don't be so self-deprecating!  I really do like the idea of there being an additional interesting choice involved in picking a die size to contribute, though.

                            Jason, I think have narration requirements tied to mechanics is a great way to go - I'm using it extensively in my design of The Committee. And the level of specificity of required content sounds perfect. I'd love to take a look at the developing game; maybe even get in a playtest if you think the game can work with three people.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/><br/>Eric                        </div>

<blockquote>So my question is - does the "your narration must include" seem tiresome, or overly restrictive, or like narrativist hand-holding? I'm too close to it to tell. </blockquote>
So, I might also be too close to tell, but: I think that your mechanic looks to be both interesting/awesome and workable. It doesn't look too restrictive as it is worded now.<br/><br/>I think that the personal sucess/collective success/collective failure/personal failure escalation is beautiful, and it really tells me (as a player) what the focus of the game is going to be, and what stuff I should take to heart the most. It's a game of teamwork and looking out for those around you, but that will always be trumped by personal rejection, losing the one you love, hearing that your parents are dead, or something similar.<br/><br/>I am also doing something similar in Boulevard, in regards to the "in your narration, you must..." part. The gameplay is largely controlled by Forces: Place (where you find identity), Placelessness (where your identity no longer matters), and Momentum (the default reaction to anything. the thing that gets out of control. the action.)<br/><br/>When a Placelessness is highest, followed by a Momentum, you are framed into a Crowd Scene - a riot, a concert, a line-up, an airplane, or something.  It's very much an "in your narration, you must... ...also, consider...." mechanic. (Although, granted, it works entirely differently and is triggered at a different point in the scene.)                        </div>

No, I like that idea quite a bit.  That plus the narrative elements that you work in for a bonus each round really do it for me.  In fact, if you recall, I was wishing that there were more of those little elements because a clever/greedy player (like Ian) is able to use them all up if he goes first.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So narrative constraints work great for me.                        </div>

So mechanically this means that missions involving younger characters are, in the end, more likely to succeed (and be fraught with [even more] tragedy), right?                        </div>

<blockquote>increment your Mission Vignette die size down by one and your Personal Vignette die size up by one</blockquote>
Pedant mode: You can't increment down. You decrement. And, what's more,  I believe that increment and decrement carry the meaning of "by one" already, so "increment by one" is a tautology. Personally, though, I'd avoid those two words altogether, and say "use the next higher die size for your Mission Vignette".<br/><br/>Jason, I like this idea, especially the inverse relationship between overall success and narrating successful vignettes. How long are vignettes? I worry that, if they're too short, this system will end up being rather prescriptive.<br/><br/>Also, as a single character, which dice do I get the option of adding to the pool? Do I generally get a choice between two dice? I forget how this rule interacts with that big grid thing.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Thanks, Graham, for the pedantry - I'll fix that.  There's a lot of clarification to be done!  Vignettes ought to be five to ten minute scenes, but this will vary by group.<br/><br/>To your question - you contribute two dice to a common pool, one determined by your grid location and the other by the Reputation you choose to use (you have two to pick from).  Both will be between d4 and d12 in size.  Larger is better, generally, unless you really need to fail (which happens).<br/><br/>Once everybody has put their dice in the common pool, each player takes one - any one they like.  Then, in reverse order, everybody gives one to another player.  So you end up with two dice, but probably not the same two dice you started with.  One of these dice will resolve your personal vignette, and the other will represent your contribution to the overall mission.                        </div>

OK. I'm tangenting slightly from the original purpose of this thread, so stop me if you like. <br/><br/>But are those the dice which are incremented and decremented in size? In other words, someone takes a d6 from the common pool and hands it to me, but the actual size of the dice I add to the mission pool is a d8?<br/><br/>I'm just asking because I love the idea of taking dice from a central pool and distributing them, but if the die sizes then get incremented and decremented it takes something away: because you don't physically use the die you were given.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

<p>I have one minor tidbit I'd like to add, J.  It's the order of the If/then statements connecting die sizes to narration.  Right now you've got this;</p>
<p><strong>If [you want this die] then [you must narrate this]</strong></p>
<p>Which encourages players to think of the die size they want first, then attempt to construct narration to fit.  Which may be just fine.  But I happen to enjoy this version better;</p>
<p><strong>If [you narrated this] then [contribute this die size]</strong></p>
<p>Mechanically it's the same thing.  However, it tells the players that they're free to narrate what they like then consider what they narrated and pick out the right die.  Of course players will still be considering the die size they want when they construct their narration.  But I just happen to think it's groovier to think of the different ways I can narrate my scene first, then consider what effect those choices may have on the game, rather than the other way around.</p>
<p>I have this feeling like there might be some way to explain why the second choice is just hands-down a <em>better</em> way to do things than the first.  But since I can't seem to articulate it, I'll just say that it's personal preference.</p>

                            Eric, that's a no-brainer.  Thanks very much.  It's funny how one person's mind will see a procedural structure in concrete terms and another will be able to see it in a different, obviously improved, way.  Some of that is distance, I suspect, and some of it is just thinking differently.<br/><br/>EDIT:  Hmm, you'll have perhaps two die sizes to choose from to contribute, and maybe only one.  So it isn't like you actually have a spectrum of choice.  Which complicates the language, if not the intent.                        </div>

                            Jason, I actually like the original (more goal-oriented) language as opposed to Eric's suggested one.<br/><br/>It informs us on what to make our narrative about. It also gives players a diving off point. It says, "Start with one of these concepts, and bring the awesome."<br/><br/>The retrospective version feels passive, and a bit disconnected. It says, "if you've done this right, it should match up with one of these four things, hopefully." It also feels weird because you can't freely choose which die size to contribute. It's more, "Oh, well I suppose I'm going to contribute a d8 then, seeing as that's what I narrated."<br/><br/>I realize what I'm arguing is semantics, but in this case it feels very huge. "If you want X, do Y" feels a lot more intuitive and fitting than "If you did Y, then you get X".                        </div>

Actually, "increment by one" is merely a redundancy.  Pedantry amongst game designers is a tautology.<br/><br/>As to the narration/die thang: I know from experience that it's very hard for me not to look at those decisions tactically.  And from the the context presented, I'd be throwing d8s whenever it made sense, because I can always pin a group calamity on some other poor sod.  In the long run, I'd been leery of clever players using big dice to point to someone else as the Weak Link, even with a personal failure.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I like the freehand Weak Link rule, since I can totally see punishing big stretches of the die/narration rule.  Is that recommended yet?  "Oh, you want the d10, eh?  You'll need more than a skinned knee and no supper to get it.  Weak Link."                        </div>
