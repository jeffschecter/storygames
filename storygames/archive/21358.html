What I want it to do is explore the area where we think we understand how our partners feel but we often misinterpret what they are telling or showing us. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Here's the game:<br/><br/>Relationship Brink<br/>By Johnathon Grach<br/><br/>After a fight you and your partner are having an \u201cI remember when\u201d conversation talking about the good and bad things you\u2019ve gone through together.  <br/><br/>1d6<br/>Negative story<br/>1 = -3<br/>2 = -2<br/>3 = -1<br/>Positive story<br/>4 = +1<br/>5 = +2<br/>6 = +3<br/>ALL ROLLS  ARE PRIVATE.<br/><br/>First player roll 1d6. Write it down.<br/><br/>Tell an \u201cI remember when\u201d story and make it more or less severe based on the result.<br/><br/>Second player respond however you like. Write down what you think the other player rolled.<br/><br/>Second player then roll and tell your own \u201cI remember when\u201d story.<br/><br/>First player respond however you like and write down what you think the other player rolled.<br/><br/>Tell 3 stories each. Add your results and the guessed results of the other player (6 numbers total). If the result is positive you want to stay in, negative you want out and zero choose either way.<br/><br/>First player say what you want, second player respond. If you agree then that is what it is. <br/><br/>If you disagree you can make one last plea and reiterate any story told. The other player can change their mind or not and you must accept it.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian" title="The_Bearded_Belgian"><img alt="The_Bearded_Belgian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Bearded_Belgian">The_Bearded_Belgian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467459/#Comment_467459" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-04T16:53:28+00:00" title="November  4, 2017  4:53PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of this, and wonder of it would be usable with kids as a game about friendship.<br/><br/>Are you supposed to tell a real "I remember when" story that both parties were included in?

It could be friendship or a more intimate relationship. <br/><br/>I would suggest using stories that didn't happen with the person you are playing with. I feel it is in the telling of the experience that we try to judge how that person feels about it and we can still do that with a fictional story. <br/><br/>Using real memories between the two players might be too stressful based on how the ending is supposed to play. You don't want some dice rolls telling you how to manage your relationships. <br/><br/>Take away the ending I've written and using real memories between the two players might be cathartic and there might be some insight into your relationship, I don't know though. I don't want to suggest there is more there than there actually is. <br/><br/>I think there could be something there for kids and friendship but again without the current ending. I would also suggest maybe only negative stories on a 1 and maybe 2. I would want it to be more positive for kids. I wouldn't take the negative out though. Kids often have negative experiences that they would like to tell.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467461">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/killertick" title="killertick"><img alt="killertick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/killertick">killertick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467461/#Comment_467461" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-04T18:03:07+00:00" title="November  4, 2017  6:03PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Say I roll a 6(+3) and tell the story <br/><br/>I remember when You baked a cake for my birthday and brought it over to my house.

Or - not much of a stretch - make a deck by picking a few out of a regular pack of playing cards: say, aces, deuces and 3s from all suits, black for negative and red for positive. Besides preventing a long string of identical results, cards have an additional advantage in that you don't need to write anything down.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467854/#Comment_467854" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-20T03:48:22+00:00" title="November 20, 2017  3:48AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agreed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467862">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467862/#Comment_467862" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-20T18:44:11+00:00" title="November 20, 2017  6:44PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting game; and I like imagining it as an actual conversation tool about real life after a real falling out.<br/>Of course, I came up with the mashup <a href="http://davidartman.com/games/rpg/fyayah" rel="nofollow">FYAYAH!</a> and the too-dangerous <a href="http://davidartman.com/games/rpg/for-mature-audiences" rel="nofollow">For Mature Audiences</a>.
