I am Gming a game of dungeon world and a new player has come on board; he has chosen the paladin as his playbook/class.  I'm confused as to how this class works-specifically that it says he can make an oath and gain an immunity to blades!!!  How do you guys GM this, as it is obviously a very potent ability.  Am I to take it that he cannot suffer any damage (in fiction consequences that would arise from being cut HP loss as well)? Am I missing something here?<br/><br/>I'm worried about balance and obviously confused....... help me out please! <br/><br/>Oliver.<br/><br/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446016/#Comment_446016" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T05:20:09+00:00" title="July  8, 2015  5:20AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Oliver <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Yes the Paladin is "immune to blades" in all the ways that make sense for the people at your table, especially the Paladin player... ask <span style="text-decoration: underline;">her</span> about details every time you are in doubt.<br/><br/>But...<br/><br/>In Dungeon World there is NO power balance.<br/>It is not important, it is not needed for the ends of the game.<br/>The point of the game is NOT to offer a challenge to the players... you can't... they'll always overcome it with relative ease.<br/><br/>Now this statement is of course exaggerated, but not so much.<br/>What you should worry about are the <b>consequences</b> of PC actions and choices.<br/><br/>So your character can't be harmed by blades? Cool!<br/>But only if she keeps her oath!<br/><br/>(hint: avoid <span style="text-decoration: underline;">telling</span> the Player that she is breaking the oath unless it is blatantly obvious, instead <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ask</span> if she thinks she is breaking it or not, and why... use the occasion to explore character motivations and beliefs)<br/><br/>So you are immune to blades, what do you do with such power?<br/>Are you a big hero?<br/>And what happens when the enemies have no blades?<br/>Are you still courageous?<br/><br/>(hint: avoid having blades disappear from your world, this is cheating and will frustrate the Paladin player, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">be a fan</span> of the paladin! Try to have enemies with mixed weaponry, and allow the PCs to attempt tactical maneuvering so that the Paladin might face the bladed ones... even suggest it yourself if they don't do it by themselves (but don't force it if for some reason they still don't want to do it) you are on the PC's side! you are a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fan</span>! )<br/><br/>Remember that the PCs are unique individuals.<br/>There are surely many "holy warriors" in the world, but only one is truly blessed, only one is immune to blades... is she famous?<br/>How do people react to this?<br/>Is someone starting to worship the Paladin instead of the Gods?<br/>What is the reaction of people when they hear her name? Do enemies flee in terror? Or do they throw away the blades and bring forth the greek-fire and the maces and attempt to kill the legendary Blessed Warrior?<br/>Or...<br/><br/>Power balance is NOT your concern <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446034">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446034/#Comment_446034" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-08T14:19:41+00:00" title="July  8, 2015  2:19PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, whether a character lives or dies isn't really the only point of balance here, either.

The fighter is good at fighting, but wait a second, the paladin can walk through a sword fight without a scratch.  that is kind of unbalancing in the sense that the fighter isn't on par with it.  I think that the paladin in most games is a blended character that has a little magicky stuff and a lot of fightey stuff going on (25% and 75%), whereas the fighter is strictly fighty stuff...  I wonder then how fun it will be for my fighter player who is may be looking askance at the new kid on the block....<br/><br/>thoughts?<br/><br/>Oliver.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446105/#Comment_446105" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-10T01:19:35+00:00" title="July 10, 2015  1:19AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In DW the fighter is not "<b><i>the one good at fighting</i></b>".<br/>All characters are <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>In DW the fighter is "<b><i>the one with a unique ancestral weapon that has spirits and wisdom, the one with incredible strength and the battelfield expertiese needed to say confidently -You stick to me, you survive- or -Whatever happens YOU are gonna die-</i></b>".<br/><br/>On the other hand the paladin is "<i><b>the one that fights with GOD's frikking hand on her shoulder, the one with a personal quest that is more important than anything else, the one that EMBODIES the law of gods and men</b></i>".<br/><br/>I don't see an overlap, let alone an imbalance, here <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446110/#Comment_446110" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-10T05:28:21+00:00" title="July 10, 2015  5:28AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            well he is named the "fighter".

So the balancing occurs there and, perhaps more importantly, in what vows are required to maintain the boons. The paladin can easily violate these vows and if that invulnerability was REALLY helping before, now they're kind of screwed, right? In such a situation, the paladin will definitely want a good fighter to rely on.<br/><br/>The paladin's niche with such a boon is not in combat prowess, it's pure story fuel, basically calling down trouble and consequences when that quest is declared. Seriously, just give the paladin vows of Honor and Truth and then watch sparks fly when the thief does <i>anything</i>.<br/><br/>The fighter, on the other hand, gets to be a swaggering, bloody badass who drives action and gets direct results in so many more, unfettered situations.<br/><br/><i>Every</i> character class gets to fight, so anyone else's combat success does not intrude on the fighter's niche. The fighter and paladin can both kick ass, their niche is about how they do it, not that they do it at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares" title="Ricardo Tavares"><img alt="Ricardo Tavares" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/695/nIETVNBV4ZU51.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ricardo%20Tavares">Ricardo Tavares</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446114/#Comment_446114" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-10T12:01:38+00:00" title="July 10, 2015 12:01PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>How do you guys GM this</blockquote>\nYou mean "Quest" at page 123?

I strongly suggest you look at Celtic, Norse and generally European myth for oaths and curses, and apply those. Looks at the most esoteric aspects of religious practices, and apply those. Think of the various Arthurian legends. Think of the myths of sacrifice and oblation.<br/><br/>The Paladin prays to their god for immunity to blades:<br/><br/>- All well and good, noble Paladin. Those that live by the sword, die by the sword. Break your own sword, and swords will break upon you. Take up arms ever again, and by arms shall you be slain.<br/><br/>- Faith shall be your only shield, and only faith shall ward you from harm. In humility shall you walk, wearing only a cloth around your waist. You shall go unshod by shoe or sandal. Your head uncovered. Your hair and beard unshorn. Your back shall be unadorned by shirt or cloak or armor, that they may see the marks from your morning flagellation.<br/><br/>- The swords and slings shall not harm you while you are on this quest. But the harm remains, waiting.

DW (and AW) are really big on questioning the players about their characters' point of view, and running it has made me really appreciate how useful it is as a technique, and how to apply it in other games. <br/><br/>I'd lean on the side of asking very leading questions of the player character: "You've taken a vow, but what is your biggest temptation to break it?" "You are immune to blades, so how do you anticipate that your worst enemy will attack you?" "What do you think your god's purpose is in testing you?"<br/><br/>(Questioning the <i>character</i> rather than the player is a subtle thing that it took me a little bit of experience with DW/AW to appreciate, but it really does help.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_446565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11" title="cupbearer11"><img alt="cupbearer11" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/394/n8RA473UODIN7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cupbearer11">cupbearer11</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446565/#Comment_446565" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-14T23:41:32+00:00" title="July 14, 2015 11:41PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>How do you guys GM this</blockquote>\nYou mean "Quest" at page 123?

So the balancing occurs there and, perhaps more importantly, in what vows are required to maintain the boons. The paladin can easily violate these vows and if that invulnerability was REALLY helping before, now they're kind of screwed, right? In such a situation, the paladin will definitely want a good fighter to rely on.<br/><br/>The paladin's niche with such a boon is not in combat prowess, it's pure story fuel, basically calling down trouble and consequences when that quest is declared. Seriously, just give the paladin vows of Honor and Truth and then watch sparks fly when the thief does <i>anything</i>.<br/><br/>The fighter, on the other hand, gets to be a swaggering, bloody badass who drives action and gets direct results in so many more, unfettered situations.<br/><br/><i>Every</i> character class gets to fight, so anyone else's combat success does not intrude on the fighter's niche.

Let's say the Paladin's name is Amaral.<br/><br/>"Hey, Amaral, you pray every morning at dawn, right? So, the next morning you're praying, and you feel a firm, gentle hand on your shoulder. You know it's not really there, but you can feel it still. A warm, calm voice rings behind you: 'Hey, buddy, what's goin' on? You called down my divine armor for some puny goblins yesterday?

Going from memory often misses half the subtleties. <br/><br/>Ahem...<br/><br/>Why the ever-living-frog-god is a DW player using Quest to clear out a room of Goblins!? <br/><br/>Firstly, any table not in some kind of weird social subjugation to the Paladin's player or totally genre-blind would immediately object to a Quest being "kill some unknown guys in the next room." There are, you know, components to this whole Questing thing: it has a capital Q and everything. <br/><br/>Secondly, it's right there, front-and-centre of the Paladins playbook. No self-respecting DM is going to let the Paladin's player take one step in his character's boots before tackling this essential and super fun bit of pre-play world building. <br/><br/>Thirdly, "rid the world of Goblins and their fowl kin" is a much better Quest than "kill just those Goblins specifically in that room" for obvious reasons of scale and economy. If I know players of any game involving dungeons and Goblins, scale and economy of genocide is of central importance.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_446648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist" title="Antisinecurist"><img alt="Antisinecurist" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Antisinecurist">Antisinecurist</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/446648/#Comment_446648" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-15T17:18:51+00:00" title="July 15, 2015  5:18PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, this is totally off-topic, but "Scale and Economy of Genocide" sounds like an excellent metal album title.<br/><br/>Back on topic: So the Paladin becomes immune to blades and goes in to kill the goblins.

The point that everyone keeps hitting is that neither the ritual cleansing, nor the mission are trivial things. Killing goblins in the next room isn't a mission unless they're a named cabal, central to the story and not just another hex of goons.<br/><br/>I feel like this might come off as condescending to mention this, but that's not my intention and it might be important to reinforce: DW, like many (but not all) other rpgs, is not about finagling mechanical advantages in a world that's predetermined like a video or board game. There's a soft spot that will make the game sink or swim: the players and how they negotiate what play is about.<br/><br/>Practically speaking, it's simple as hell to require an involved cleansing process or have the paladin's deity interpret "mission" differently from how the paladin's player wishes they could for a little bit of mechanical leverage. But if you don't want to be perceived as a domineering game master, cast a wider net: is everyone at the table okay with the paladin abusing the power? If they claim to be okay with it upfront, does it later bother them when the game deforms around the paladin too much? How does your group handle that?<br/><br/>As <a href="/forums/profile/Isaac">@Isaac</a> mentioned, this stems from a social contract and expectations. So it seems like the initial question in this thread could just as easily be a general one about handling the intersection of 1. what the group wants and 2. how one player wants to leverage rules that allow/require creative interpretation.<br/><br/>I can't say for certain that's what all of this is really about, but I have a nagging feeling that's part of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
