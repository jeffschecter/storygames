Caveat emptor, read charitably, one love.<br/><br/>So I've been running a Trail of Cthulhu game for a couple months now. By any measure I think I can call the experience a success: players are having fun, I'm having fun. But it's not high-grade fun. It's ... just fun. We laugh a bit, we dig into character motivations, we poke at the system. But at the end of every session there's this feeling that 90% of what just happened was on me, as GM, to bring to the table. And so I thought about that a while and came up with some conclusions about the experience.<br/><br/>For one, it seems like the very structure of a ToC-style investigation is that all kinds of interesting shit has already happened. Possibly <i>all</i> the interesting shit has already happened. Of course none of it <i>happened</i>: the players weren't present, it's all just in my head, guiding the logic and creativity of the investigative effort. It's lonely fun. <br/><br/>I get that there are two basic ways to make an investigative game interesting: Either you make an interesting puzzle for the players to chew on and/or you explore the effects of the investigation on the characters. And that's fine too: I hit the Pillars and Sources hard to make them relevant to the characters, I give them good "core clues" so they've always got a lead to the next scene.<br/><br/>Just thinking out loud here, I think some of it is the fact that it all feels so reactive. The players are reacting to the facts of the investigation, either by OOC noodling over the puzzle and/or IC playing toward their flags, such as they are in ToC. <br/><br/>I think that, in the end, this model of investigation-focused roleplay just isn't that enticing to me or my Tuesday crowd. I've been gnawing on a more...I don't know, Burning Wheel-style investigative model but that one's hard. You'd have to undermine the whole "Beliefs are instructions to the GM about what I care about" model, I think. Or else build the entirety of the mystery upon what the players have staked out -- which, allegedly, I've been doing via ToC's Pillars of Sanity. It could be that that's the missing piece for us: the game doesn't really care about how you protect or pursue your Pillars, it just cares about how you lose them.<br/><br/>Anyway, just some self-indulgent reflection on a model of play that I thought I'd explore again after a couple decades away from BRP's take on it.<br/><br/>p.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269941/#Comment_269941" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T15:39:53+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  3:39PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul,<br/><br/>Have you taken a look at Dirty Secrets?

Mysteries and investigations are reactive. They just are. That's as true in the real world as it is in fiction.  You can't investigate without a mystery to dig into*. In the world of RPGs, if you've got a GM whose job is the world, and the players, whose job is the investigative character, you've got to bring something to the table. If you don't like that job, nothing in the world, no system, <i>ever</i>, will make you like mysteries and investigations in games with GMs (that includes Burning games).  And in jointly authored games without GMs, where nobody has that job, you never have the feeling of discovery that you do in games where there Really Is a Real Answer and you are deploying your character to figure it out. So pretty much I'm nodding along going "yep, yep" - everything you hate about mysteries (like pre-planning them, etc.) I really love, including their reactive nature ("You think you've got such a cool character, well what about THIS bah ha ha") - and I recognize them in what you're talking about.  <br/><br/>Two, I think the Dirty Secrets model really isn't all that different from what you describe as problematic above, and it's not going to solve your issue.  In Dirty Secrets, the mystery is never solved, in the sense that you work out what's going on through your character interacting with the fiction - not even the Investigator solves anything.  Because everything is made up in the moment and there is no means of enforcing continuity on anyone, the creation of a coherent mystery relies on the ability and the inclination to remember and improvise, which is going to differ with everyone at the table.  Most importantly, the culprit for each crime is generated randomly.  (Yes, randomly.)  So while you don't have to bring a mystery to the table, the most anyone at the table can do with the mystery is lean it in a particular direction, which means there's really no there there.  That's not to say that it's bad, but Dirty Secrets isn't really a mystery game in the sense that the players are there to puzzle out something that's going on.<br/><br/>* Welllll, you can. Maybe that's a new post.  But you can have an investigative game without mysteries. Political games, for example, are highly investigative, but it's rarely because information is hidden, it's usually because it has to be traded and evaluated.  Exploration games are all investigation but the mystery is just "something is over there and you don't know what it is".  Still, I knew what you were getting at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269953/#Comment_269953" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T16:33:50+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  4:33PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2010 4:35PM by ccreitz.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started a whole conversation about this with respect to BRP <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=12014" rel="nofollow">here</a>. You have my sympathy. I always wind up running Cthulhu in our group, but I hate GMing for a whole variety of reasons - not least of which is that I need to know the answer to the mystery, which leaves me resenting the other players for their chance to discover it in play. To make it fun for myself again, I have, over the course of many years of Cthulhu, applied democratization-of-play techniques as I've learned them. In particular, I've not allowed myself to do significant prep; I've treated skills that players buy up as flags; I've used fishing and reincorporation to get everyone into the details business instead of making it my job alone; and I've... there should be a word for "focusing your efforts on maintaining a reward cycle that reinforces the game's themes"... Baker'd up my games by picking out a reward cycle based on sanity-blasting revelation in the fiction and accompanying SAN loss in the metagame (rewards to the players, of course, not the characters!). That last one is what drove me to write up my OP in the linked thread.<br/><br/>The trick is to get the non-GM players to feel free to introduce clues. Once you get everyone over that hurdle, the rest comes naturally. Start them off describing the wallpaper or the traffic, and then ease them into describing the body, the spoor, the assembled cult. Let the mystery emerge (or stay hidden - that's fine and thematic, too), so you don't have to write it. Then you get to be surprised along with everyone else at the table. You get to marvel at the ingenuity and deviousness and malice of your friends instead of setting up your own ingenuity etc. to be marveled at, because even if it's fun at first, that latter option gets boring after a while. It's so much cooler if you, the Keeper, are investigating the space of possible Cthuloid badness right alongside the characters.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm the dirtiest hippie I know, and I haven't played a game with anything like a traditional GM in about three years. I've been getting my Cthulhu fix via <i>A Penny For My Thoughts</i>. YMMV.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269962/#Comment_269962" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T16:53:58+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  4:53PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>And in jointly authored games without GMs, where nobody has that job, you never have the feeling of discovery that you do in games where there Really Is a Real Answer and you are deploying your character to figure it out.</blockquote>\nI disagree. I don't feel like I'm lacking a "Real Answer" just because we all found it together and no one knew it ahead of time. Ultimately, the "Real Answer" is always made up, regardless of whether the GM, the author, or all of us at the table make it up. If anything, the one that we make up together feels slightly <em>less</em> made up to me, because it came from what all of us experienced together at the table, rather than one person's imagination.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269965/#Comment_269965" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T16:58:57+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  4:58PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You may find yourself in the minority on that position, Jason G.

Say, one where the bulk of the investigation is interviewing/interrogating NPCs rather than chasing inanimate clues, or one where the GM's input is more responsive to your investigative focus (e.g., you decide to see whether Uncle Sal pays for his fancy car with drug money, and the GM responds by making drug dealing a significant element in the mystery)?  In other words, how much of your problem is "I don't like the way these GMs run mysteries" and how much is "I don't like mysteries run by GMs"?

To me, the traditional, GM-run mystery feels like an invented secret. The GM invented it, and I have to guess what he invented. A collaborative mystery feels, to me, more like discovering a secret, piece by piece. No one invented it. It was there, at the intersection of all our input, and we all had to work together to pull it this way and that in order to discover it. That it did not exist before we discovered it does not make it any less a discovery in my mind, since it is still not anything that any of us invented.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>In other words, how much of your problem is "I don't like the way these GMs run mysteries" and how much is "I don't like mysteries run by GMs"?  Just curious about that.</blockquote>\nIt could be a matter of style, but I suspect it's not. If collaborative play is a different animal than investigating a mystery, then I submit that what a GM runs is a different animal, as well. In a real mystery, the possible lines of inquiry abound. You can do "good ol' fashioned police work" by talking to people and getting the answers the old fashioned way. You can pull out the forensics unit and get into some deep CSI stuff. You can follow the paper trail, you can do surveillance\u2014really, the options are endless, and any of them could potentially get you the answer. But even the most thoughtful, prepared GM hasn't considered all of those possible avenues, and even the most adaptive, quick-thinking GM's reach a point where they need to have something prepared ahead of time. So it seems inevitable to me that you'll eventually hit the wall of the perfectly valid investigative option that fails for no other reason than the GM didn't think of it, and so, ultimately, even in the very best scenario, we're just playing a drawn-out game of "guess what the GM had in mind."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269983/#Comment_269983" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-04T18:42:17+00:00" title="May  4, 2010  6:42PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the issue is always on where the focus is.  Is the focus on *solving* the mystery in the puzzle/mental challenge sense?  Or is the focus on what do the character do as information is revealed to them.<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vineyard is effectively a mystery game.  One where the GM preps the mystery before hand.  But the focus isn't on solving the mystery.  The focus is, once you discover John is sleeping with Mary what do you do about it?<br/><br/>Dirty Secrets has a similar emphasis the difference is that information is aggregated as you go along.  But the focus of the game is still on what the Investigator chooses to do with each new pieces of information.  The Mayer is having an affair with a 15 year old prostitute!  Tell the police?  Use it as leverage?  Try to rescue the girl?  What, what does he do?<br/><br/>I think people who are focused on that "Do" part are generally more satisfied with twists and reveals that are knowingly made up on the spot because all that does is give them something new to DO.  But people focused on the puzzle/mental challenge aspect aren't satisfied because there's no sense of accomplishment with working things out.

Even the player, at the end, has to "solve" the mistery. Has to do a good job of deduction to arrive at a workable solution (so much that the game explicitly advice having always a solution in mind during the game, even if you have to revise it to follow the other player's actions). It's the nearest equivalent of reading a detective novel and trying to discover the mystery before the end I have ever found in rpgs \n<blockquote>Because everything is made up in the moment and there is no means of enforcing continuity on anyone,</blockquote>\nThis is actually false. Any violation of continuity would be canceled by Jurisdiction or Appeal.  \n<blockquote> the creation of a coherent mystery relies on the ability and the inclination to remember and improvise, which is going to differ with everyone at the table.</blockquote>\nI get the impression that you take for granted that everyone mush always choose alone, with the other people silent. Narrativist games are not played like this. They are much more collaborative. I have played Dirty Secret with a lot of people, and even if I would not say that everyone can play any role in that game (the investigator must be played in a very aggressive way), I have never found any problems with people's "inclination to remember and improvise" (the most common problem - the only one worth mentioning apart from the way to play the investigator - it's the ability to frame a scene, because it's skill that most gamers lack or have been trained to not use)\n<blockquote>  Most importantly, the culprit for each crime is generated randomly.  (Yes, randomly.) </blockquote>\nThis is actually false, too.<br/><br/>The players choose the names to write on the board. It's not random. The choice is among a fixed set of characters, it's not random. The place where you move the token is not random, the number of paces is given by the choices made in a conflict and the direction is chosen by the player. If you play without thinking and without caring you put names at random (but you will not get to play at my table), if you play the game following the rules with honesty, the reason why a certain name is on the board is anything but random<br/><br/>After all this, you roll on that not-randomly filled board to get a "who", but not a "what" and a "how". You must deduce them yourself.  The corrupt policeman is guilty of...  of having killed his wife? Or having stolen the cash? Why? How did he do it?  You decide. It's not random. And if your explanation doesn't "fly" with the other players, it will be appealed.<br/><br/>Really, I find laughable that rolling mountains of d% to "find clues", trying to get enough of them to get to the end of a crumb trail, trying to avoid being killed (by rolling another mountain of d%) could be considered less "random" than a game like Dirty Secrets where you must DEDUCE a solution that make sense, with your brain.<br/><br/>[edit: crossposted with the last 3-4 posts]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270008/#Comment_270008" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T00:35:35+00:00" title="May  5, 2010 12:35AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 5, 2010 12:38AM by JDCorley.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>Anyway, have you played Dirty Secrets?</blockquote>\nSee the credits.\n<blockquote> Even the player, at the end, has to "solve" the mistery.

You're not looking at a situation and trying to figure out what happened. You're looking at a situation and trying to decide what you think would be the best way for things to have happened.<br/><br/>Many times a name is written on the board early in the game when someone has an idea of how an existing crime would be possible with that character and then during crime resolution, the crime for which that name was written has already been resolved, or later developments have made that person's involvement virtually impossible, or worse, narratively uninteresting.  Murphy's Law holds: that will always be the person whose name comes up in crime resolution.  One hundred percent of the people I've played Dirty Secrets with disliked the random crime resolution, minus me, I guess, since I like it.  To say that crime resolution is not random is...baffling. It's random. You roll a die on a table. The experience is extremely random. Remember that the person rolling the die may have only written one or two of the entries on the table. You can pretty much guarantee that you won't land on a name that you wrote. You can lean the game towards someone being a culprit but you really have to emphasize that person and only that person to have any kind of statistical impact.  It also "helps" if you convince everyone else at the table that your version is the one they should all go along with.  The problem is that even then all you have is a probability that someone is the culprit for any given crime, so it doesn't actually help the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270014">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270014/#Comment_270014" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T02:10:39+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  2:10AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a player, I've found there's a thin line between "thrill to the discovery of the answers you've been fervently seeking!" and "try to read the GM's mind so he'll tell you what to do next".<br/><br/>As a GM, I've found there's a thin line between "yay! everyone's totally engaged by this mystery I made!" and "everyone's looking to me to make the whole game go; I'm exhausted".<br/><br/>These two lines might be the same line, actually.<br/><br/>I think it's largely a matter of signalling via the fiction.

From the rest of your reply I get that you played it with your group. How many times? Once, seeing that it seems you didn't like it very much? Twice? Did you play it with different groups? With people you don't usually game with (at cons, for example)? With the final rules or with a playtest draft?<br/><br/>As a disclaimer: I play in many different regular gaming groups and I played the game with each of them. And I run a lot of conventions demo with the Dirty Secrets Italian publisher, Narrattiva.  Dirty Secrets, in my experience, has some very strong "entry requirements" (the ones I already listed: the investigator has to be very proactive, and the players have to be able to frame aggressively) but if you satisfy them, it's one of the "can't fail" games, it work like a charm every time. I never had any problem whatsoever with continuity in any of my games: peoples usually don't ruin their games willingly, and when you devote hours of your time to play a game at a Con, you WANT to play that game, you don't "just show up to shoot some shit without caring about it".

He have to revise it every time something happen in the fiction that change the conditions. Often it's not even that the old solutions is not valid anymore, but that the fiction developing has "opened" a better solution.<br/><br/>If you go to the table with an inflexible solution in mind and you don't want it changed during the game, Dirty Secrets is not the game for you. But it never happened during a Call of Cthulhu game? That the solution you had in mind at the beginning of the game was not the one the GM had already fixed for everybody? If you don't practice complete no-myth illusionism (illusionism without anything fixed: you hear what the player think about the mystery, and when they think of a solutions you go "right! You got it" in any case) players like these would "walk away with their vision of the various crimes absolutely unsupported" every single time...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>This is actually false.

Sure, not for everybody. But it's a perennial favorite.<br/><br/>I wonder if part of the reason for that is because what's being described here sounds like a static, "puzzle" style mystery - where the events are in the past and the task of the players is to gather clues and assemble them into a picture, then apply that completed picture in some way. In my experience, that's very rare.<br/><br/>Typical play involves an ongoing mystery, where there is pressure (of time, escalation of events, an active malefactor who continues to do badness and to actively thwart investigators...) and characters are forced to repeatedly take action on the basis of an incomplete understanding of circumstances. The solution to the mystery is not just "Hah! I'll now explain how the crime was committed!" but "Oh god! The killer's going to strike again, and I think I know who his next victim will be. We have to stop him!"<br/><br/>I think it's fairly obvious that a collaboratively-created solution is quite simply less fun than a GM-created one in that situation. The puzzle is not a thing to discover. It's the adversity of the scenario - the mystery is the ENEMY. And both creating and resolving your own adversity is usually dull as dishwater.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270045/#Comment_270045" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T07:20:57+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  7:20AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>How many times?

The solution to the mystery is not just "Hah! I'll now explain how the crime was committed!" but "Oh god! The killer's going to strike again, and I think I know who his next victim will be. We have to stop him!"</i><br/><br/>Yes - what we call "antagonist reactions" in GUMSHOE. <br/><br/>I like playing mysteries with a pre-determined cause, because it's easier for me to get into the mind set of an investigator - there really is a mystery to solve. If there is one player who has defined what the mystery is, and knows it well, the play is much more likely to be consistent and the mystery more interesting and involved. Everything the PCs investigate is measured against the GM's knowledge of the solution. The downside, I suppose, is that more depends on the GM. As a GM, if you don't enjoy making up stuff in advance- "lonely fun" - then that pretty much excludes any game which involves prep, investigation or otherwise.<br/><br/>Collaborative mystery games are fun authorially, although many of them have players who take the GM role. The mysteries tend to become a little inconsistent, incoherent, and somteimes very silly, and rather than depending on one player (the GM) to do a good job, they are much more dependent on everyone doing a good job. So, you can get a lowest common denominator effect. I've had great fun with Mortal Coil and a Taste for Murder with the right players, but Penny for Your Thoughts just went wrong - nothing inherent to the system, but people mucking about and imposing silly choices on other players. <br/><br/>Maybe I (slightly) prefer the former because I've rarely played with a bad GM in an investigative game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270053/#Comment_270053" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T08:15:39+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  8:15AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Moreno R.</cite>If you go to the table with an inflexible solution in mind and you don't want it changed during the game, Dirty Secrets is not the game for you.

If you don't practice complete no-myth illusionism (illusionism without anything fixed: you hear what the player think about the mystery, and when they think of a solutions you go "right!

I think this absolutely ties into the challenge aspect of mysteries. In a CoC game, there really is, in the real world, a solution to the fictional mystery. No one expects (and many don't even desire) the power to change it. What they expect is a fair opportunity to uncover it.  I've had plenty of Call of Cthulhu experiences that ended up where the PCs didn't uncover all of the mystery, or do it in time to stop the bad guys.  The game anticipates this and its modules explicitly lay out what happens if the PCs fail.  The complete explication of the mystery, in my experience, almost never happens in play. You're always left with a handout behind the screen, or a piece of the puzzle they didn't get. This is good module design for a game about how unknowable the universe is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270058/#Comment_270058" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-05T08:51:13+00:00" title="May  5, 2010  8:51AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>As a player, I've found there's a thin line between "thrill to the discovery of the answers you've been fervently seeking!" and "try to read the GM's mind so he'll tell you what to do next".<br/><br/>As a GM, I've found there's a thin line between "yay! everyone's totally engaged by this mystery I made!" and "everyone's looking to me to make the whole game go; I'm exhausted".<br/><br/>These two lines might be the same line, actually.<br/></blockquote>\nThis is a very intelligent observation, I think.

For example, the killer isn't just trying to get away or stay hidden: he's coming after the investigators with an axe in the middle of the night. And the investigators are involved in a love triangle.

It's a supplement for Sorcerer, naturally, but a chunk of it is also a treatise on using relationship maps in play. Specifically, Ron goes into detail about taking relationship maps from hardboiled mystery novels and lifting them for use in Sorcerer (though adapting it for other games is simple). We took Ron's technique and adapted it as the Planetary Web in Burning Empires. Dogs in the Vineyard is another example of a game that's adapted it to good effect.<br/><br/>My personal feeling is that Whodunits and procedurals don't work in RPGs. Or at least I've never seen one work to my satisfaction. But make it about people and their relationships and it can sing. Uncovering what's going on is only the beginning.

There's always forensic research, as the doctors learn all the patient's secrets in their effort to make an informed diagnosis.  But the show doesn't succeed off these qualities.  Each patient is a one-off who the viewers will never see again, so there's minimal investment in their life or death for it's own sake.  And the diagnosis involves laundry lists of weird diseases most viewers have never heard of, so the audience doesn't get to "think along" with the puzzle-solving.<br/><br/>The meat of the show is the way in which the patients' symptoms and secrets reflect and pressure the main characters' issues.  Well, that, and the interactions of the main characters that have nothing at all to do with any investigations.  So this is clearly <b>character-focused</b> fiction, just like the movies that inspired Dirty Secrets.<br/><br/>As for <b>urgent</b> investigative fiction, I think it's epitomized by Agatha Christie's <i>And Then There Were None</i> (aka <i>Ten Little Indians</i>), wherein a bunch of folks are locked up together and they keep dying one by one while they try to deduce which one of them is the killer.  The reader is there along with the characters, watching everyone's behavior, learning everyone's motives, and tracking who had the opportunity for each murder.  In the end (I think), a final piece of evidence is found, which, when combined with all the rest, conclusively shows the murderer's identity.  We readers figure this is coming, but we still enjoy completing the puzzle amidst the suspense of seeing who'll die before completion.<br/><br/>So.  That leaves pure <b>forensic</b> fiction.  Is there anything that's really driven by this, <i>without</i> urgency?  The first contender I can think of is <i>The Purloined Letter</i> by Poe, wherein a villain has hidden a letter, the cops can't find it, and the protagonist reasons his way to the answer.  By thinking like the villain, he finds a clever solution the cops have missed.  The reader enjoys seeing the protagonist collect and synthesize data, and finally reveal his process and conclusion to the cops.  I think it might have been urgent that the letter was recovered, but I don't think that played a big role in the story.  Some Sherlock Holmes mysteries seem to work this way too.<br/><br/>I don't see any reason why RPGs can't emulate all this and help players tell any of those types of stories.  The complication arises when players are looking to <i>solve it themselves</i>, exactly the way you can't when you're an audience.  I suspect there's a split, wherein few story-tellers go the <b>forensics</b> route and few puzzle-solvers go the <b>character-driven</b> route.  <b>Urgent</b> investigative fiction seems to fit best in both agendas, but you still need to <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11461&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">know which one</a> you're working with.<br/><br/>Crap, now I don't know if any of that was helpful.

Want to share more?</blockquote>I get the sense that it'll take a whole group of techniques working in concert.  Right now, all I have are some individual ones.  <br/><br/>First example that comes to mind is <b>fill-in questions</b>.  Basically, when the players miss a solution to a puzzle, the GM poses them a question whose answer is that solution.<br/><br/>Example: the GM presents a locked door with a weird knob, and mentions the knob is of the same material as the altar.  He expects the players will go, "Same material?  Same procedure!  Burn incense on the knob!"  No, it's not obvious, but that's intentional, as the GM is trying to allow the players a "we figured it out!" experience.  So, the players stare at the knobs, note the material, but then start turning them and doing other stuff that won't work.<br/><br/>So the GM needs to pose a question that fills in this gap.  Like, "There's a weird smell on the knob that's vaguely familiar, but you can't immediately identify it."  The GM's now given a hint (smelly!) that's probably useless on its own, but he's focused the players' attention on soemthing productive: asking, "Why would the knob smell?"<br/><br/>This is a great technique to bust out when the players are embarking down a dead-end that threatens to be time-consuming.

Unless the game has some obvious constraints on not just form but also style, then you can easily get something that looks like this:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/c/c6/Exquisite_Corpse_-_D_A_M-2.jpg/220px-Exquisite_Corpse_-_D_A_M-2.jpg"/><br/><br/>It's fun but ultimately unfulfilling. With investigative games in particular this is a problem because you want the mystery to work, not to just be some dull background to what the players are doing. It has to be one of the goals to solve the mystery, even if you don't get there. And if you don't for some reason, there has to be some other kind of closure for the game to be satisfying. So perhaps you didn't find the mcguffin but you died heroically in the attempt, or it brought you and your brother close again, or you found your real parents, or a bigger conspiracy etc.<br/><br/>But to avoid the exquisite corpse, with the emphasis more on corpse than the exquisite, does require work from everyone involved, especially around awareness of the different goals of the players or characters.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270223/#Comment_270223" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T08:47:17+00:00" title="May  6, 2010  8:47AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I get that there are two basic ways to make an investigative game interesting: Either you make an interesting puzzle for the players to chew on and/or you explore the effects of the investigation on the characters. And that's fine too: I hit the Pillars and Sources hard to make them relevant to the characters, I give them good "core clues" so they've always got a lead to the next scene.<br/><br/>Just thinking out loud here, I think some of it is the fact that it all feels so reactive. The players are reacting to the facts of the investigation, either by OOC noodling over the puzzle and/or IC playing toward their flags, such as they are in ToC.</blockquote>\nWe happen to be doing an investigative story in a D&amp;D game I'm a player in.  We had a meeting where the players (me included) basically flopped around, not knowing what to do and obviously focusing on things that were really just incidental to the DM but seemed important to us.  Some time after that session, I talked with the DM and mentioned that one way to handle this was to have an NPC "guide" character that the PCs could talk to.  He said there actually was one, but we hadn't thought of talking to him.  I said I'd be happy to function as a plant and point the party to him.  He told me who it was.<br/><br/>Next meeting, my character, who was a newcomer to the party, anyway, asked another PC how this whole situation had come about and if there was anyone else we could talk to.  The conversation we had was all it took for her to hit on talking to the NPC the DM had in mind.<br/><br/>So there's a technique that has worked well for me in the past: have a player be a plant.<br/><br/>By the way, that player later mentioned to my wife that she thought it was an awesome session.  I didn't let on that I was a plant.<br/><br/>Magicians do this kind of thing all the time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270261/#Comment_270261" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T11:10:22+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 11:10AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul:<br/><br/>Why have you and your players chosen to do investigative games?

I even did it on an ongoing basis for a full 16 month Cyberpunk Cops campaign, which was organized with a Board like the one on Homicide: Life on the Street. Of course, because of the Homicide connection, nobody expected to solve every case and triaging what they were investigating this week was the main choice of the story. I'd love to try that again.  Pretty much my prep every week was lonely-funning 15 or so crimes, often no more complicated than "he shot her because she preferred his brother".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270319/#Comment_270319" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T22:01:45+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 10:01PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Shoot JD, we need to start a thread on Lonely Fun and "presentation" games of different kinds!<br/><br/>Or is that too Primordial School and not nearly Dirty-Hippie enough for this neighborhood?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270323/#Comment_270323" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-06T23:37:29+00:00" title="May  6, 2010 11:37PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn kids, with their hula hoops and their fax machines...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parke" title="Parke"><img alt="Parke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v97/mikker/Zoosmell.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parke">Parke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270629/#Comment_270629" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-10T13:52:47+00:00" title="May 10, 2010  1:52PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, I had this whole post about mystery games planned for my blog, then I read this and it destroyed everything I was thinking about.<br/><br/>I don't want to wade into the pre-planned versus emergent mystery debate (I think both work), so I'll just offer some ideas about pre-planned mysteries, as I've been thinking about GUMSHOE recently.\n<ul>\n<li>Hit Those Drives.

Every one in the game must write their own mystery and run it, round-robin. </li>\n<li>If you're doing a mystery campaign, make sure you have a long-term mystery. Look at recent shows like Veronica Mars and Life. They had season-long mysteries that you got little bits and pieces of as you go.
