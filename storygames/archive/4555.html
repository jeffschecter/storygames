I haven't read it all, but it has a lot of things that I really like.  One of the things I especially like is the game-world concepts to explain the Powers of Changelings.<br/>For those that haven't read it, in the nWoD version, Changelings were originally humans that were kidnapped by Fae.  After spending time in the world of Faerie they changed, becoming more (or less) than human.  Fae supposedly derive many of their powers from agreements (Contracts) between various entities or even forces of nature.  By becoming servants to the Fae (and sort of part-fae) Changelings become able to draw on the clauses of the contracts as well.<br/><br/>I think this is really cool.  Unfortunately, I don't think the game really uses it to its full potential.  In actual game terms, all you've really got is a hierarchical list of powers under each Contract.  The only way the Contract concept really ties in is that each power has a Catch which allows a Changeling to utilize it for free under certain conditions.<br/><br/>So, while I'm interested in playing or running Changeling using the normal system at some point, I'm also really really interested in this idea of magical powers derived from agreements, and I was wondering if anyone can think of any systems that might do this justice?  Clearly Sorcerer does this to a certain extent, but I'm looking for something that offers a broader range of things.  Mortal Coil could work as well, I think...  Anyone else have any suggestions?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots" title="dyjoots"><img alt="dyjoots" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/dyjoots">dyjoots</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103044/#Comment_103044" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-14T18:55:07+00:00" title="October 14, 2007  6:55PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Contract/Catch of Changeling reminded me of Power/Price mechanics in Mortal Coil...

You can have Held Dice, which are dice you acquire at some point before the action, usually in some form of preparation, and then throw into the mix when you really need them.  You could have a bowl of Autumn Dice, for example, and they'd just sit there on the table until you needed to have your character pull out the big effects, then you dig in.  Of course, when they're gone you have to get more somewhere.  <br/><br/>The trick with this kind of mechanic is that the replenishment is usually fiddly and tedious, and therefore tends to get neglected in actual play.  For example, in the old Werewolf (maybe the new one, too), the supernatural gifts all get taught by tutelary spirits.  Theoretically, you should play out tracking down and impressing these spirits and swearing strange oaths in order to get the next cool power; in practice, in every game of Werewolf I've ever played, they're just powerups.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103137/#Comment_103137" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T17:45:38+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  5:45PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had the exact same thought.  Changeling has all this meat, about the mortal life you were stolen away from, the Fae life you escaped from, and the Changeling world you find yourself thrown into.  Past relationships, current politics, and the risk of insanity!  Great stuff, and hardly supported by the rules. Great story grist that feels like its being held back.<br/><br/>So, I started designing one.<br/><br/>It revolves around the balance between a Changeling's Fae side and their Mortal side.  Utilizing one half puts the other at risk.  For magic, contracts, pledges, and oaths are all the same system.  They all have to do with bargains and costs, so I thought it was silly to not make it universal.  I've been juggling a lot of creative projects, so it's falled by the wayside for over a week (I posted the 101 thread because of a block I hit with this), but I will be getting back to it this week.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
