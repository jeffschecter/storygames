It's fun, separate, and non-productive, except when it isn't. But it does little to generate uncertain outcomes. And it's mostly not fictitious or governed by rules (other than standard social rules which, if you focus on those, break down the "separate" factor).<br/><br/>By Crawford's multiple terminologies, Facebook is a toy. It is an interactive plaything without goals.<br/><br/>Most other definitions include a goal, which Facebook doesn't have.<br/><br/>Facebook is a collection of multiple forms of communication that focus on networked sharing. And it's a place where people can play games.<br/><br/>Is a coffee house a game? Cause Facebook is more like a coffee house. Except without coffee. But it can still be a place where you spend a lot of time and that causes you to lose sleep while producing little of value.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374367/#Comment_374367" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T14:47:33+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  2:47PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about Jane McGonigal's argument about Wikipedia being a "game" in <i>Reality Is Broken</i>, as well as its <a href="http://thiscageisworms.com/2011/11/22/on-reality-is-broken-by-jane-mcgonigal-2/" rel="nofollow">subsequent critique</a>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374368/#Comment_374368" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T14:48:11+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  2:48PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, it's not a game.

As such, it is much easier to describe it in game terms in a fruitful way. It's not explicitly constructed as a game, but analyzing it as a game provides a satisfying explanation of its success.<br/><br/>As for whether it's fun, well, I suppose there's a good reason why only a small percentage of users participate in the construction side. Some find it fun and others don't.<br/><br/>The "subsequent critique" seemed rather petty and tedious to me. His arguments in favor of women and non-humans and avoiding the evils of gamification sounded like tangential "Won't somebody please think of the children?" arguments. Heaven forbid that tedious work be structured like a game, because then people might have goals, and goals are bad.\n<blockquote>I think that every game needs to fight the goal-minded, linear existence that McGonigal praises. We need more Minecraft and less Call of Duty.</blockquote>\nReally? Every game needs to do this? Every game needs to be a toy and not a game?<br/><br/>I mean, Minecraft is great. But every game needs to be like that?<br/><br/>And here's the thing. If you're analyzing Wikipedia as a game, it's much more of a game like Minecraft than a game like Call of Duty, anyway. It's all about building things (articles), feeling good about the good building you've done, and maybe receiving a microscopic bit of praise/recognition for your efforts (maybe).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374393/#Comment_374393" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-25T18:10:45+00:00" title="April 25, 2012  6:10PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I ever win Facebook, I'll be sure to write a session report.<br/><br/>Seriously though, I think people are free to feel that they have won or lost Facebook without any outside input without coming to any sort of agreement between users.

"Everything is a game to you!"<br/><br/>But there's a difference between being able to play with something, and that something being a game (you could say that you <i>play</i> the latter but <i>play with</i> the former). <br/><br/>Facebook is not a game in the sense a hammer is not a game. You can transform the hammer into a toy with a thought and play with it. You can even play a game with it, but the hammer is not in itself a game. It's the hammerness of it, that makes it a hammer and which does not include gameness. For a game to be a game, it has to be designed as such (even if spontaneously).<br/><br/>But that might also depend on one's specific experiences with facebook. Mine are very non-gamey. I have played with facebook, on occasion. But it's a tool for connecting and communicating in the sense a phone is.

Partly because you said it is, but it still would be if you didn't. It creates goals (though emergent goals are certainly very possible), it defines a space in which it exists (the comments section of that photo), it even has structured interaction (the rules for how to challenge another person's addition). It could maybe use the addition of a defined conclusion, but not having one doesn't make it not a game.<br/><br/>But that doesn't make Facebook a game. Facebook is the place where the game takes place.<br/><br/>My dining room table isn't a game, but it's a place where a game can sometimes take place. Dinner can also take place there. Or bill-paying. Or planning a vacation. Or sex. All kinds of things can happen there.<br/><br/>For the owners of Facebook, Facebook itself is more of a game than it is to the users. They have a goal - they want to get people to spend time there, so they can sell adspace. To that end, they do stuff that will help them meet their goal. They try to make the site a consistently engaging experience so that it will keep drawing users back to it. There are certainly gamelike elements to that interaction.<br/><br/>I think there are other websites that match a game model much more clearly, mostly because they have goals attached to them. <br/><br/>Selling sites like ebay or etsy are kind of like a game - keep your star rating up so you don't lose potential customers, get people to link to your etsy designs on Facebook so more people will see them and potentially buy (or at least praise you for your awesomeness). <br/><br/>Dating sites have a lot of gamelike aspects - OKCupid is super gamelike - you get to see how answering questions makes you more or less compatible with specific people and you get the opportunity to answer questions that they've answered, hopefully increasing your compatability rating if they interest you.<br/><br/>I'd say that, overall, the "it's not for reals" element of gameness is the part that can be reduced the most and still have something recognizably gamelike. You can do things that are very much "for realsies" but use gamelike structures to help them be more engaging and successful. If I understand correctly, that's the main thrust of McGonigal's book. And I think she's on the right track, there. (Though my opinion is formed partially in ignorance - I haven't read her book. I'll add it to my short list.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374530/#Comment_374530" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-26T11:03:20+00:00" title="April 26, 2012 11:03AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Facebook is a game in exactly the same way as a medical waste disposal landfill full of infected syringes and rotting, bloodied bandages is a football field.</blockquote>\nPlayed there once.

They need to get real work product as an output, but they get free help by making things gamelike. They emphasize the fun elements - people are free to contribute what they like when they feel like it, people are praised for awesome contributions.

I can make posts hoping for likes and comments, but my aunt can post vacation photos and not care and still get value (possibly even more enjoyment) out of it. <br/><br/>Literally gaming Facebook is something I do for a living. I suspect that 5% or less of users (granted, some of the more active users) try to game it in their own way, but most of that is no different than a web developer trying to maximize SEO or increase comments on a blog. There's an attention getting game that can be played. But you can use Facebook in the way it was intended without any of that.<br/><br/>But the key factor isn't what could be done. You can gamify just about anything. That doesn't mean life is a game (philosophically is a whole 'nother conversation).<br/><br/>The key factor is playing the game the way to interact with it? Using Chess as an example, I could make up stories and characters and let the pieces move in different ways. No one would mistake that for playing chess. Anyone can use Facebook and not try to game it and they are still using Facebook fully and completely.

In other words, is it only a game when you're gaming the system and perverting it's intent?<br/><br/>Sorry to get all tangential with OKCupid, but I think it's an interesting parallel example. It's also, at it's core, a social site for communicating with people. But it's much more goal-oriented. And it has interesting gamelike features that I think are a big part of it's success.

One example is that every time you edit your profile, it gets put onto the stream on the main page. So, make an edit to a profile and if it gets a good response, then it's a good edit. If there's no response, edit that section again tomorrow until results are achieved.<br/><br/>Faking it makes it more of a game than answering honestly. You should get matches either way. So answering dishonestly only works if you want certain results. Like playing a game, it's a strategy.<br/><br/>There's no more strategy to answering honestly, hoping I'll get people who will like me, than picking an item on a menu, hoping to get something I would like to eat. Maybe a game argument could be made, but it's broadening the definition to uselessness for me.<br/><br/>It's not a game for the same reason Facebook isn't. You could game the system, but that doesn't mean the system is a game. <br/><br/>Things will get fuzzier as gamification spreads across the web and out into devices and interfaces beyond it. I don't really like the idea of taking things and asking if its a game using some definition agreed upon. If I define a dog as something with four legs, a back, furry, and bark, then someone could claim a wooden chair with rabbit fur armrests is a dog (obviously, I don't think this discussion is that ridiculous).  Microsoft may add game elements to Office to make writing or presentation creating more compelling and motivating. I don't think that will turn Word or Powerpoint into games.<br/><br/>We use words to define reality, but reality is not defined by words. For that reason, I like what Hans said. If something isn't marketed as a game, then it probably is not a game.  If I make something and say it's supposed to be a game, then it probably is. <br/><br/>You might try my "game" and tell me that it's a crappy game, and that could be because it doesn't fit the definitions in certain ways. You might instead tell me that it's actually a toy, or entertainment, and it's great at being one of those things. If I want it to be one of those things, I might call it done. If I want it to be a game, I will need to consider your input and determine if I went wrong somewhere.<br/><br/>My point is, what I (the creator) claims it to be carries more weight in my book than definitions creates to describe these activities we humans carry out. FB and OKC aren't in danger of being mistaken for games. If Nathan hasn't asked the question most of us wouldn't even think twice about it. But most importantly, they were not created to be games. If tomorrow Zuckerberg announces they are rebranding FB as a game, then I will completely change my mind and say it is a game. I'll also have a few points on how it is a crappy game.<br/><br/>(Even though I drifted, from what I can tell OKCupid is virtually unchanged since the acquisition - the only noticeable change is they took down an excellent blog post illustrating how the Match.com business model was exploitative and terrible for a dating website)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_374765">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374765/#Comment_374765" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T14:24:56+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  2:24PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so OK Cupid isn't completely 100% a game. But I wasn't trying to say it was. I was trying to say it had definite gamelike elements and that you can look at those gamelike elements as a way to analyze what works well about it. The fact that it works a lot like a game is a big part of the reason it's popular and successful.<br/><br/>Facebook, on the other hand, is successful for different reasons. It does a few things really well. It provides a way for you to strengthen a connection you have just made to a friend of a friend whom you've just met, for example at a party. It provides a way for you to keep tabs on your network of friends by getting snippets of info on what they are doing when they decide to post such things. It provides an excellent platform for organizing events that occur within an established network community. And it provides an application development platform that allows application developers to leverage those network connections as part of the application (ie. visiting your firends' farms in FarmVille).<br/><br/>It does those things really well. But those things aren't inherently gamelike, except for the game applications, which are a separate entity existing within the Facebook framework.<br/><br/>I think you're getting stuck on putting things completely in the "it's a game" bucket. Obviously Facebook and OKCupid and Wikipedia are not 100% games.<br/><br/>But I think McGonigal is right to analyze the gamelike structures of Wikipedia and say that those elements contribute to it's success.<br/><br/>And I think that OKCupid lends itself to similar analysis.<br/><br/>And I think that Facebook, when looked at that way, comes up with a pretty resounding "no".<br/><br/>And I think the reason for that revolves around goals. Wikipedia and OKCupid both have goals that the users are participating in (for Wikipedia, I'm referring to the article editors, not the readers). And they both have gamelike feedback elements that encourage participation directed toward those goals.<br/><br/>Facebook, on the other hand, is much more goal-agnostic. The providers have goals - get people to spend time there so we can sell more ads. Some of the users have goals because they are using the site for goal-oriented purposes, like marketing or recruiting. But the primary users don't have goals that are addressed in a gamelike way.<br/><br/>I mean, I guess there's a tiny bit. If you want attention from your friends, you need to post often, so your posts will be at the top of their feeds and they'll see them.<br/><br/>But I guess I see the more obvious inherent goal of accessing the site as "checking in on your friends to see if any of them have posted anything interesting" rather than "get attention".<br/><br/>If you're an attention whore, I suppose it's more gamelike. I'm about to defriend one of those, whose been driving me crazy with post after post after post about nothing interesting. So I guess she looses (if I'm selfish enough to think she cares whether I read and enjoy her posts, I suppose).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_374766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/374766/#Comment_374766" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-27T14:25:35+00:00" title="April 27, 2012  2:25PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and thanks for giving me an update on OKCupid.
