I'm trying to embody some new (to me at least ) principals into my game design, and am looking for some ideas<br/>\n<br/>\n1&gt; Interesting RPG premises, I tend to make pretty trad games and while i am trolling the 6 random things thread that's floating arround here somewhere, I just thought I would ask if there was anything in rpg's people that was intersting and was underrepresented (I don't think a game about space marines or dungeons and monsters would perhaps be adding a whole lot but who knows)<br/>\n<br/>\n2&gt; Interesting RPG mechanics, As I said before, I tend to do the trad thing with the dice and stuff betraying my d20 gamer upbringing, but I'm always looking for new and nifty dice card social interaction rules. <br/>\n<br/>\nEssentially I am just looking for something to rift on<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for any and all ideas forthcoming, <br/>\n<br/>\nLogos                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169664">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169664/#Comment_169664" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T11:40:49+00:00" title="September 17, 2008 11:40AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Try to design a mechanically interesting game, one that would be fun just to play as a game (without the fictional overlay), without using randomizers of any kind (no dice, randomly drawing cards, drawing tokens from bags, etc.).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169671">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek" title="wundergeek"><img alt="wundergeek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_g1t5HfNJ47o/TJeoZAeG69I/AAAAAAAAAfQ/clp1K8KZ75o/s400/domo-avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wundergeek">wundergeek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169671/#Comment_169671" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-17T12:01:34+00:00" title="September 17, 2008 12:01PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Might I recommend taking a look at the I Want a Game About This thread that Jason Morningstar started?
