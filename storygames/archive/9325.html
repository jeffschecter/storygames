It generated some interesting feedback, comments and discussion in whispers so I wanted to open this up for a more general discourse.<br/><br/>What is <i>Chronica Feudalis</i>? Well it's an adventure roleplaying game set in medieval Europe. While its not a FATE game per se, it does borrow aspects and maneuvers from that system to round out a fairly rules-lite step-die system. The entire rules set will be OGL.<br/><br/>It uses a mentor system to create and advance characters. It's kind of like a life-path or career system, but each step of the path is a relationship you have with someone. You're encouraged through the system to maintain these relationships to continue learning the skills your mentors teach you. And you're encouraged to develop new relationships in order to help learn new skills.<br/><br/>The conflict rules center around four arenas: chase, combat, parley and subterfuge. They essentially use the same system (chase deviates a bit) with their own trappings. The tools you use play an important role. A fancy gown is just as powerful in a parley conflict as a bow is in combat.<br/><br/>There's currently a free play-test draft of the rules available on the website. I'm about to go into the layout stage of the book, but I'm still very receptive to any feedback you might have.<br/><br/>If you're interested in giving the game a try at Gen Con Indy, there's two sessions I'm running as part of Indie Games Explosion. Slots are still available for both of these.<br/><br/>If anyone has questions about any of this, let me know. You know how it is when you're working on a new game. All you want to do is talk about it.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206707/#Comment_206707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-11T10:30:52+00:00" title="May 11, 2009 10:30AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Both your sessions overlap with my games  B-(  <br/><br/>Do you think you'll be running anything afterhours?

I plan on bringing a bunch of copies with me. I just started layout tonight. I already have the artwork for the chapter headers, but I'll be commissioning a bit more to pepper about the interior. The final chapter, the one I didn't include in the play-test draft, is with my editor now but I should have that back soon. It's exciting to see everything coming together.<br><br>Yeah, I think you can see that it's fairly easy to support various settings just by changing the names of the mentors. Here and there you might need to customize a mentor a bit. But stat-wise they're just three skills (ranked at d10) and a handful of tools, so pretty easy to make them up on the fly if you need to. Some short pdf suplements with mentor lists, unique tools, example aspects, and some historical background for regions like Asia Minor, North Africa and Al-Andalus might be neat. <br/><br/>The idea I have kicking around right now is a companion book that adds rules for managing manors, mass combat, and generational play. For the latter your retired characters get to be new mentors for character creation.<br/><br/>I also want to do some in-depth supplements that detail particular historical events in the 11th and 12th centuries, like The Anarchy in England or the Reconquista. Basically like an Osprey guide but for role-playing.<br/><br/>Thanks for the kind words, Scott. I can't wait to see what you do with it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207497/#Comment_207497" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T21:37:52+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  9:37PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jeremy, how well do you think the Chronica Feudalis engine would handle other time periods?

In fact I've been thinking recently of cobbling together Chronica Imperium to run a campaign heavily inspired by HBO's Rome. You would need to work up a new mentor list and look over the various tools, but then you'd be set. I think the skill list works pretty well for any sword and shield era. <br><br>I've deliberately left some room in the tool rankings for some progress to be made. You'll notice that armor currently caps with the scale coat at d10. I've left the d12 open for plate armor. Weapons currently go up to d8. I've slotted the d10 for the anti-plate pole arms that start appearing in the later middle ages: halberds and that sort of thing. So you may want to take that into consideration for a Musketeer-era game.<br><br>Aspects really do all the heavy lifting, and they're versatile enough to handle anything by default.<br/><br/>I'd be interested in seeing how you adapt CF to IAWA and the sword &amp; sorcery genre in general. Admittedly, one of CF's greatest strengths in my opinion (the finite range of results in the dice system) is also a pretty big limitation. While there's 5 grains of human ability (d4 - d12), there's only 1 grain for superhuman (d20). It should work fine for low-powered, gritty fantasy, but you might find some difficulty scaling it up for super-powerful threats. Of course one option is always to build wider (more Vigor, supernatural aspects) rather than taller.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden" title="ScottOden"><img alt="ScottOden" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ScottOden">ScottOden</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207640/#Comment_207640" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-15T13:13:58+00:00" title="May 15, 2009  1:13PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to see the modifications for Chronica Imperium, if you're of a mind to share once it's ready!

Basically it's a roll-off system. You roll a die for your Command skill, a die for the size of your army, and invoke any tools or advantages that your side has that the other side doesn't: if you have archers, and they don't; if you have castle walls and they don't; if you have a trebuchet and they don't. If you win the roll, each success reduces the size of your opponents army by one step. Haven't tested it out yet, but hope to soon. Trying to figure out if I can work in maneuvers into it.<br/><br/>The second is Tactical. Everyone breaks their army down into units of archers, soldiers, knights. Each unit then basically plays like it's a single character. I'm still trying to figure out how to match unit scales with more static elements like castle walls and siege engines.<br/><br/>I started brainstorming mentors for Chronica Imperium (though I'm thinking of calling it Chronica Antiquus and writing it to cover Egypt, Greece, and Rome) <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9396" rel="nofollow">in this thread</a>.
