Here's what I came up with so far...<br/><br/><i>nekojanai</i> wrote:<br/>Mood: Confused<br/>Music: Tales Of Centuries Hills<br/><br/>Eh... today was strange.<br/><br/>Ran out of juice and rice this morning... had to have an egg. Bleah. I can never boil them right, they taste like sulfur. Tochan said that they tasted like the first fireball she cast, ha ha. Way to cheer me up, Tochan. Told her I'd be out to the store; she said "Try not to freak out." Why does she keep trying to keep me down?<br/><br/>Went to the corner store. It was raining, so almost no one was there... which was nice. The person who was there...<br/><br/>...It was Akira.<br/><br/>Damn it, I thought I wouldn't see him again after I broke up with him...<br/><br/>He went over to talk with me, surprised to see me. Apparently he's going to some small artsy kind of college. "Least I'm not a ronin," he said. I smiled the sort of smile that if you see in in a renai you know they're faking it, you know? He didn't pick up on it.<br/><br/>Told him I was busy, knee deep in Ori Ochi Onoe... apparently he does play some renai games. "Not the really sick ones," he added. Ha. Sure you don't. I told him O3 was in English. Apparently he's fluent. <br/><br/>Said he'd check it out, then asked me if I was allright. I don't know what he's implying by that; he told me I looked... down. I really don't know...<br/><br/>He gave me his number... just when I thought I was over him...<br/><br/>I asked Tochan for advice. She seemed to do well enough. She just looked at me funny and said, "He's trouble, and you're in no position to be dating anyway. I mean, look at this place. It looks like a tornado ripped through the Hirameki art studio and deposited all it's junk across the bedroom and kitchen."<br/><br/>Remind me why I ask Tokho for advice again?<br/><br/>Still... I kind of miss him, but I think he'd freak if he saw me here...<br/><br/>I'm going to bed to sleep on it.<br/>---<br/><br/>What I find interesting about this is how easily I was able to construct a backstory and a coherent narrative from RANDOM FREAKIN DIE ROLLS.  Also, how creepily easy it was to get into Seiko Aino's head (she's mostly female so I can use an icon of mine bearing a striking resemblance to the Innocent Sweetheart pic from Bliss Stage, if she went to a Manson concert, but it took on a life of it's own).  I'm beginning to see how powerful random events could be.<br/><br/>Also, this is dark, but not nearly as dark as I thought it would turn out.  Huh.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226588/#Comment_226588" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T15:23:19+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  3:23PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2009 3:25PM by Eric.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...wow.

No spoilers, but let's say I didn't see it coming, but in retrospect it made perfect sense. I blazed through it and I was finished with it by 4 - amazing. Next in line is Gakuen Dream.<br/><br/>I told Tokho about it afterwards, and then I asked her for advice on how to deal with... him. Akira. I still wasn't sure what I was going to do. I wanted to talk to him, but... well, I'm not exactly as good looking as I was then. I've gained weight.<br/><br/>"Why are you asking me?" was Tokho's response.<br/><br/>"You have more experience with this," I said. "I mean, you and Kei and just... just a good couple. You're happy together."<br/><br/>"...He's a dork."<br/><br/>"Who?"<br/><br/>"Kei."<br/><br/>"He's an adorable dork. He's adorkable, if you will."<br/><br/>Tokho smiled at that. "God knows why I like him."<br/><br/>"Yeah, but you do."<br/><br/>"You have Akira's number," Tokho said. "Couldn't hurt to call him."<br/><br/>I really couldn't argue with that, but I was scared. She helped walk me through what to say, and I called.<br/><br/>He... was between homework, and he was happy to hear from me. I told him that I had beaten O3, and that it was good, and I think I said "I am really nervous about talking to you, it's been a while," but as one long word in one breath.<br/><br/>He took that as a compliment, thank God.<br/><br/>"I miss you too," he said. "We should meet for coffee, or something. And talk about dating sims, I guess, just as long as we also talk about something else."<br/><br/>"I'll... try," was my response. I meant try to go out. Where there are people. Who aren't Akira.<br/><br/>"Please do," he said, and we said goodbye and hung up.<br/><br/>I really will. I feel good about this.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>The plot thickens. Also, I know am not messing up the rules; I would have probably wasted all her time on Elven Relations or something if I did it right yesterday, ha.<br/><br/>Also, I appear NOT to be running into the "Lose all otaku traits due to meddling Rescuers" feedback loops. I AM running into a raised hope feedback loop, though.

I don't know what to say. I don't know where to begin.<br/><br/>Tokho's apparently reading over my shoulder, because she just told me "At the beginning. Duh."<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>When I woke up, I decided that I really did want to meet with Akira today, but I also wanted to try Gakuen Dream. But... I know how I get. If a story is really interesting, it's hard for me to pull away. Tokho suggested that I call my sister Makoto. "Mackie would relish the chance to rip you bodily from the computer," she said with a grin.<br/><br/>I really don't like Makoto. She doesn't like me much, either: says I'm in a fantasy world and that ren-ai games are pieces of crap.<br/><br/>I'll cop to the former, but honestly - has she MET most of the creeps in the real world? In a ren-ai game, you at least have a chance at love.<br/><br/>So I told myself...<br/><br/>Anyway. I called her, and asked her in the middle of her rant on that subject to help me get off the computer at two so I could meet Akira.<br/><br/>"Willingly meeting a human being. Will wonders never cease," she said.<br/><br/>"That's not fair!"<br/><br/>"Yes, it is."<br/><br/>"I beg you for help and this is how you treat me?"<br/><br/>She got all quiet. "...you're serious."<br/><br/>"Yeah."<br/><br/>"...I'll be over at 2."<br/><br/>She was good as her word. Before I knew it (or got to the Keenan ending of Visual Stage), my computer turned off. I looked up and Mackie, in that hideous skanky halter top of hers, was holding the plug to my power strip. I gave her a sheepish grin and she marched me to my closet and made me "presentable." The only thing I really had that looked good was an old uniform bottom and an Archer t-shirt, which... didn't make her happy. But she did help.<br/><br/>When I thanked her, she said "What I want in return is for you to keep meeting this person and have a REAL relationship, do I make myself clear?" I nodded. "Now get out of here."<br/><br/>When I left, I saw her climb onto some sleazeball's motorcycle and wrap herself around him. Ecch.<br/><br/>Akira was right there at the coffeeshop, and he got me a drink. Something with a lot of sugar and milk, you know? He talked to me about some of the art he was doing - he was doing some composition and sketching stuff. Interesting stuff. I said that I wasn't that good of an artist and I showed him some sketches, mostly of Tokho and her friends.<br/><br/>He looked at them for a long time with a strange expression. "Did you trace these?"<br/><br/>"Um... no. I was copying..."<br/><br/>"Freehand?"<br/><br/>"...Yes?"<br/><br/>He looked for a while, then smiled and said, "This is really good."<br/><br/>For all I know, a bug flew in my mouth, it was open so wide.<br/><br/>"These are characters from a ren-ai, right?"<br/><br/>I nodded. He said, "Have you thought of drawing your own?"<br/><br/>"I - I haven't been in love, I couldn't do it right."<br/><br/>Then he put a hand on mine, and I FROZE, both at that and his words.<br/><br/>"It's not too late to try again."<br/><br/>I... I kind of spazzed, there. We talked a little more, but I wasn't in any state to say anything.<br/><br/>I went home and by way of not thinking about it until I needed to got the Keenan, Josh and Nathan endings to VS. Twice.<br/><br/>Tokho prodded me until I told her what happened, and she just... smiled, and said: "Go. For. It."<br/><br/>...I'm so happy right now, you don't even know.<br/>----<br/><br/>Earlier, I managed to wipe out the Ren-Ai obsession when I forgot to play it right. It bothers me that it only takes a margin of 8 points to do it: I'd expect it to lower it a die or two, possibly 1 die plus some Hope. It does bother me, and I'm going to bug Ewen Cluney to revise this game.<br/><br/>Still, this is awesome so far. Tune in tomorrow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
