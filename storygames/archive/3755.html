There is a recent <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13162.phtml" rel="nofollow">review on rpg.net</a> which gives a good idea of the contents.<br/><br/>The awesome is that Greg Stolze isn't above explaining his design decisions, also telling you why the system works instead of only how; the flavor text actually is fun to read; the weave of rules/gameworld/rules/gameworld make for an entertaining and diversified reading experience. Parts of the game world description remind me of The Shadow of Yesterday's format for Near, which is a big plus in my book. Also, the text on love and relationships is longer than the one on magic items.<br/><br/>Everybody probably heard about the Company rules. IMHO, they help an aspiring GM to get a grasp on something that often is handled ephemerally or by metaplot. Mr. Stolze does discuss the interaction of these rules with an ongoing game on several levels (i.e. the relationship of characters to companies depending on the individual power level of the characters), which also helps understand how he intends these rules to be used. Since Zach asked: The rules not only help the GM in hand-waving (some don't like too much of that), they also give the players tools to change the status quo if they don't like it without depending too much on a GM knowing how to wave their hands.<br/><br/>Did I mention the first two supplements have been ransomed, and the second one is accompanied by a podcast/story thingie? So, support of the game is also great, a lot of stuff can be found in a wiki (<a href="http://www.gregstolze.com/REIGNwiki.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gregstolze.com/REIGNwiki.html</a>), which is a great resource to browse for additional info like fan created stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84205/#Comment_84205" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T04:30:08+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  4:30AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: oliof</cite>For one, it<i>easily</i>reads cover-to-cover for me.</blockquote>Same here. Incredibly enjoyable read so far. ^_^<br/><br/>(Well, for some value of cover-to-cover. I almost never read game books in order, instead just jumping back and forth between different chapters. Still a great read.)<br/><br/>Two thing I was very surprised about in Reign is that it managed to make two things fun that I've always HATED in a game: <br/><br/>Random Character Generation and Hit Locations<br/><br/>Before I got Reign (and to a lesser extent Wild Talents), seeing a Hit Location silhouette while browsing a book was practically always a sign that said "No, this book is not for you". it talked of, to me, unnecessary crunch and fiddlyness, too much concern with minutae and so on. in Reign (and to a lesser extent Wild Talents) I actually LIKE the Hit Locations. They aren't a huge headache as in other games, they make the game deliciously gritty at times and interface nicely with other rules like Armor, Martial paths or various combat maneuver. (For example, you know those moments in movies where one character manages to put his sword at the enemies throat, forcing him to surrender? There's a really nice maneuver that does exactly that.)<br/><br/>Random Character generation was, again, always a big no-no for me. I want to do my own characters thank you very much. Maybe it's because I've never been an "old-school" gamer, I don't know. But anyway, in Reign? Most delicious fun. There's a great and easily customized Random Character Generator that (1) is only one of two methods (the other being point-buy), (2) neatly interfaces with the regular point-buy system, so using a mix of both is no problem at all and (3) makes just cool characters! And that was the biggest surprise for me: While I was impressed at the thought that obviously went into the generator mechanically, the fact that the characters it produces are cool and instantly have a nifty backstory really sold me on it.<br/><br/>Not to mention that there's also an equally awesome One Roll Company generator in the first (free!) supplement, which made the thing even better. Last week or so, I sat down with one of my players and did nothing but play around with the generators a bit. After less then an hour, we each had a cool character (Yay for Unusual-Knight-more-into-Gardening-and-Cooking then-fighting and Beggar-turned-Sailor-turned-merchant-turned-Prisoner-turned-Monte-Christo-Type-Guy-with-extra-Love-Triangles!), we each had a cool company (An idyllic little island with gentle hills and nice, nosy people, that just happens to lie right next to one of the worst pirate islands ever. And they are even connected by mariage!) and could have begun to play right then and there. <br/>After less then an hour and four dice-rolls, we had two cool characters, two cool companies and a great situation already set up. And best of all: It wasn't work, like character generation normally is with this player. It was pure fun.<br/><br/>-------------------------<br/><br/>There are many other awesome things in Reign, like the cool Esoteric Disciplines (Think fighting schools for non-combat skills.), the nice interplay between companies and characters (Characters actions give bonuses to company rolls, while companies can do cool things charcters can't, like build Allegedly Impenetratable Fortresses*.) and the nice cultures and interesting quirks of the setting. (Though the actual ... geography can be a bit taxing on the mind.)<br/><br/>All in all, it's just a really well-made fantasy game. I'm not sure if it revolutionizes fantasy gaming and it does have its weaknesses (For example, I'm not really sold on it's Passions and might use something more Key-like) but, all in all, it's one of the best, most enjoyably written and most versatile fantasy games I've read the last few years. And it even looks nice!<br/><br/>Aaron<br/><br/>* And yes, that's actually in one of the lists in the "Stuff On Which To Spend Money" chapter. And yeah, it's really called that. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_84371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/84371/#Comment_84371" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-31T14:01:29+00:00" title="July 31, 2007  2:01PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2007 2:01PM by rafial.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your 5 minute guide to Reign awesome:<br/><br/>1) Read page 13 so you know how the dice mechanic works (making sets)<br/>2) Read page 27-28 so you know what the stats are, and how skills work<br/>3) Find 11 ten sided dice<br/>4) Flip to page 50, roll those dice, and write up the resulting character.

They're definitely solid - they're almost identical in shape to the org rules I have for Elsewhere, which makes them easy for me to understand.  I like the integration with the characters as well - but the real juice is how you combine the Qualities in actions.
