So I'm hopeful you could point me to any obvious holes/potential game breaking issues you may foresee from reading this:<br/><br/><i>1) Create the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Goal</span> for your character answering this question: <b>\xbfWhat do you want the story of your character to be about?</b> you can write that your character wants to save his town, conquer the world or even destroy it. If players want to act as a team, however, they all must list the same goal for their characters.<br/><br/>2) Next, explain what's the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Motivation</span> you character has for doing that. You can start by choosing one of this themes: Duty, Glory, Justice, Love, Power or Truth. Then, use that theme to explain your motivation. It's recommended that if all players are acting as a team, they should have different motivations.<br/><br/>3) Now describe the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Inner Obstacle</span> your character has. First choose one of the capital sins: wrath, greed, sloth, pride, lust, envy, and gluttony. Then describe a way how that could refrain you from attaining your goal<br/><br/>4) Create 1 to 3 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Relationships</span> to other characters. Use only one if players want more of a door kicking adventure and all 3 if they like dealing with their character's emotions. You can use all three in the same character if you can explain how. You can also use these to define a relationship with other player's characters.<br/>- Inspiration: This character is either a mentor, relative, friend, love interest or even an enemy who inspired you to reach your goal. Write her/his name, what your character admires from she/he and what were the words that inspired your character.<br/>- Nemesis. The Goal of this character is either completely opposite to yours or perhaps their goal is just to keep your character from reaching his/her goal. Ask other player to give your nemesis a name, create a motivation for he/she in the same way you made the motivation for your character. Finally, write down one reason why your character can't get rid of his/her nemesis until one of them reaches their goal. <br/>- Love interest. Write a name for she/he,  choose if your characters are already very close to each other, if you're separated or if they haven't cross much words yet. Whatever you choose, there are feelings between the characters that can't be denied and their destiny is interwined for either joy or tragedy.<br/></i><br/><br/>This is supposed to give the GM more hooks to leat the PCs into trouble, but are left for each player to create as a way of giving them flags/keys to help the GM lead the game in the right direction. It's also been made in this form to fit in a GMfull game I'm working on, but I've got the feeling it can be used in more games/ways that it seems. But that's just a hunch I've got.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377635/#Comment_377635" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T17:19:19+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  5:19PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Two issues I found from my design which is similar, is <br/><br/>1) coming up with these : "blank page syndrome" <br/><br/> Its really hard if the player doesnt have a pre-concived character.  Its like saying "be creative - RIGHT NOW!"<br/><br/>Theres no real way around this, other than to offer help.  First of all, the player doesnt have to fill them all out at the start, they can fill them in as they play, but obviously they are encouraged to fill in as many as they can as early as they can.  Second, I made a big list of example character personalities and the types of motivations such a character might have.  Lastly, I gave a few guidelines on identifyng strong motives from weak ones.  Your leading questions/guidelines are more specific than mine, and that will help a lot to combat BPS.<br/><br/>2) How do these motives etc.. fit into the game mechanically?  what stops them from being more than just words on a page that players may ignore during play?  Or if you have really strong mechically links in mind, does that actualyl make them a straitjacket for the character during play?  Theres a fine-ish line there I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377684/#Comment_377684" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-10T21:53:55+00:00" title="May 10, 2012  9:53PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, the BPS is a big issue I'm trying to deal with my designs. <a href="http://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">This deck</a> was designed with that in mind, and though it can help solve this issue I'm also relying on player input to add more variations to the game. I've seen that specific questions help a lot, though it helps even more if these are related to an specific setting, theme and/or game idea. (currently I'm focusing on the default medieval fantasy to make things easier in the design stage)<br/><br/>I made this post at work and on my way home I recalled another thing I should totally include: the time frame. I mean, a character wouldn't come up with all these things in one day, they would be the result of many events through their life. In the same way the player shouldn't have to come up with this all at once. You're right about creating these memories during game in flashbacks, I found really interesting how that was used in 3:16, and it's even something that could be applied to some particular skills.<br/><br/>We discussed this with some folks here, talking about a design for a game with a military theme and high lethality: all PCs would start with the same stats, equipment and basic skills. But whenever a particular skill was required, platoon commander would ask "I need someone trained in demolitions" And then one player could state that his character has that skill, purchase it on the act and make a roll for the task. If your character died before using that skill then it saved you at least some time or even skill points you could have used on something actually useful.<br/><br/>Anyway, in this case is kinda difficult, since the GM will need at least some of this data upfront to create scenes that actually matter to the player. Offering examples isn't too bad, since once a player has something that clicks then other players usually get inspired to beat the odds. I was also thinking of random generators like the onse used in Reign, which I also found quite promising (though after a few tries you sorta feel characters start to resemble a lot) And now my Pathfinder GM has fallen in love with the Harrow Deck, so perhaps giving players the option to roll a random goal/motivations/inner obstacles and relationships, or leave that to the deck (it shouldn't be too hard to find a way to use it for this) and a few specific questions.<br/><br/>Now about how these work in the game I think using a Fate "aspects" compelling mechanic could do the trick. However I have a way to limit the GM from pushing that button too often and I would never allow the players to push that button themselves. I tried aspects in that way in another game and all I got was crappy almost metagame statements from the players. Of course their characters were getting in trouble by their own initiative but it was sorta bad joke, the way they were doing it, since they actually didn't earned the fate point the hard way, they just kept pushing the button until enough problems arise and they either relayed on each other, evade or pitched one problem against another.<br/><br/>The way I'm seeing this things in game is that they should be the theme of an specific conflict scene, at least one at a time or in combinations of two or three. Let's say: In this scene the main issue is an NPC who is unwilling to give out some crucial information, but the GM has the choice at this point to involve the character's Inner Obstacle on it. So she states that the player starts to despair and give out to his anger and it's about to draw his sword and attack. And then comes the resolution mechanic applied first to the PC trying to calm down.<br/><br/>I know it's kind of simple, but for a game that is meant to be (hopefully) GMfull, and directed (again, hopefully) to  unexperienced GMs, to come out with these variations on the conflicts it's what I'm aiming for. Of course, I'd still keep the fate point mechanic to let players buy their way out of it... not that these points would be too abundant or only used for this in the game.<br/><br/>I was also interested in the "Drives" buy-off mechanic, since it's kinda easy to notice after some play that one of ypur drives wasn't exactly what you were looking for. But the again I'd make that into a theme for an specific scene, at the end of which the player gets to change their motivation and/or their goal, but not without paying for it. I'd even add that other players could vote if the player could change something for free based on her interpretation, if she should pay or just keep their character sheet as it was. Anyway, perhaps for one session games and/or new players this won't be used.<br/><br/>Hey, many thanks for the questions, they gave me a lot of ideas!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377873">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377873/#Comment_377873" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T16:53:12+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  4:53PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These sound like a great start, but I would wonder as a player (and GM), how does one create the setting and situation? Is it GM determined? Established / embedded by the mechanics, a group brainstorm? For without that the characters will appear disconnected.<br/><br/>Sure their relationships are explicitly created with each other, they have a goal that they want (fictionally), and motivations that are countered by inner obstacles, but how does any of that relate to the situation at hand? How does the setting influence these choices?<br/><br/>Most importantly I want to know as a player how I am to be rewarded for establishing and playing to these 'motivations', both fictionally and mechanically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377896/#Comment_377896" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T22:33:52+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 10:33PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For the setting, the game starts establishing Medieval Fantasy as a first basic constrain. After that, players have to brainstorm to answer only two questions: What's the main danger threathening the setting? What is your best hope to beat it?<br/><br/>I know it sounds too broad to define a setting, but this is most of the time enough to set things in motion. It's only after this that players start to create their characters, so they can connect their motivations with the setting defined by their answers, adding material to inspire other players. Perhaps I should add an instruction in the procedure for creating PCs: u<i>se one of the NPCs, skills or items the previous player created and connect it to your character somehow. It can be either a resource or a motivation in your character sheet</i><br/><br/>For the situations, in GMless mode, each player in turn draws 4 cards from the deck I mentioned above and players get to add details to the situation created by the result, using another procedure. You can check the deck on my blog (the link is on my previous post) to find out exactly how it works. In the first and second testing of the game PCs were separated for most part of the game. When they meet there were some awkward unfocused conversations, mostly because it was an early design, they weren't sure if their characters were supposed to stab each other or become friends and then stab each other... so I knew I had to put a better frame there, not only in the mechanics (if they fight what do they get, what they miss) but in the motivations (why would they fight at all? What could stop them from killing each other?) <br/><br/>So yes, if the fiction doesn't state early that players are allies or foes, it's hard for them to get to any of those states by themselves without a previous agreement. Or at least it may not be a strong enough conflict. You see, when playing among good friends in a good mood, suddenly trying to find a reason to fight each other, even playfully, can be kind of difficult (may generate more BPS) if there isn't a well thought previously arranged excuse for that. But if the game states this already as a procedure and provides a way to create a conflict of interests between two (or more) fictional sides, then players can blame the game and accept easily a playful conflict between them.<br/><br/>Of course it will depend on the kind of game you want to play. Right now for this game I'm not implementing player versus player yet, though it will be certainly an interesting one to pull off.<br/><br/>About the way these work with the setting, well, I haven't been exactly a fan of alignments, not only for the limitations they represent sometimes when you're trying to interpretate a character, but for the abuse of this player established fact of their character by some GMs. I found this also works on reverse: if players get rewarded when they use this mechanic then the suspension of belief is at least threathened, and it kinda breakes completely when there isn't proper mechanics or a good GM call to prevent the abuse.<br/><br/>Whenever I've seen them in play at their best, motivations actually work when:<br/>1- Players use them as a guideline to interpretate a character and the GM doesn't use it against them.<br/>2- The GM tips the player to use their motivations to make an scene better and the player catches it quick and goes along.<br/>3- The GM takes it as a Flag or a Key and includes situations where the player's motivation matter, and lets the player deal with it in any way they want.<br/><br/>So I came up with the idea of "GM abilities". Each player starts the game only with the most basic GM tolls for framing scenes. However, each time the GM challenge is beaten by the players, she can add one tool for the arsenal they use for framing scenes. One of those tools is the permission to frame a scene with a challenge that deals with one of the PC's motivations, objectives, connections or inner obstacles. This way is guaranteed that the story will get a bit deeper at some point and it can even be a major turning point for the character, but it won't be happening all the session and the player won't monopolize the spotlight. This mechanic also helps to keep challenges fresh and more complex as the game progresses, as well as making the learning curve less stepped for players without previous knowledge of GMing.<br/><br/>So there, no special rewards for playing your motivations, but you can be sure that they will matter in the game eventually and that beating a challenge that involves those is gonna mean something for your character. Hmmm, however I think I'll give the reward a second thought...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377899">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377899/#Comment_377899" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T23:26:08+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 11:26PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do goals, motivations and such make characters easier to play?

I'll tell you what it makes me think of: In a novel, we don't necessarily know the characters right off the bat. We get to know them through their choices. By the same token, it might be cool if the players know in advance what fields they need to fill in, but those fields (goals, obstacles, relationships) emerge through the choices that get made during play.<br/><br/>So a character meets an NPC, decides to sell him out to the guards. Relationship gets defined -- and maybe now, this character has earned the enmity of the noble house of so-and-so, and so now we've got an obstacle as well. So that choice, which the player made, kind of establishes the character's situation. Gives the player some context for the decision, in advance, and lets the player define the character during conflict. Don't know if that would actually work! But that's an approach I've never tried before. <br/><br/>And, on that note, if there are any games that already do this, I'd love to know about it, because it would be cool to play a game like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378021/#Comment_378021" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T21:04:50+00:00" title="May 12, 2012  9:04PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: stefoid</cite>Tell us more about that, Simon</blockquote>\nI just mean I've played games where you come up with a lot of upfront character stuff, and games where you don't, and I haven't really noticed that it makes much difference to how easy or fun the characters are to play.

Most of the time as a player, even when you enjoy acting the character in deep, you only use a few things you created as a general guide to roleplay the character. Perhaps you just define the character by the fact that he's a fighter and a merc, so you play it as a smart-ass only interested in money, for example, and add quirks to make it a memorable character. As a player there's no need for more at least in your usual dungeon.<br/><br/>However an unexperienced GM could find hard to railroad a group of characters like this into a particular adventure; so unless you help him, the party may get stuck in a bar fight the whole session and never start the adventure. Things like objectives, motivations, relationships are all tools the GM uses to keep the adenture going and have justifications for whatever the PCs should be doing. That in the worst case scenario of an unexperienced GM that is trying to railroad the adventure, either in a good way or a bad one. So just for the sake of Murphy's law I'd say: define at least some motivations for your PC. Unless your GM thinks he/she can handle the heat<br/><br/>There's also the part of having all players (and the GM) in the same page, something really crucial for GMfull games. Having players state what kind of game they want from the beggining is a totally time-saver for this and it may save your game from going gonzo, something that also happens a lot in games with a traditional GM.<br/><br/>I don't know if this sounds familiar to you: whenever we start playing, we usually start thinking of our characters as individuals rather than as a part of a group, unless:<br/>a) It's stated in the fiction (players are a group of adventurers, a special operations team, etc) (and even if this is the case, it doesn't mean that the group is already formed, it just means that it could be formed eventually)<br/>b) the players care to make a previous agreement about starting already as a group.<br/>c) The GM defines how PCs are related in a previous dicussion with the group.<br/>d) the GM hand waves this part stating that the characters are already old friends, etc.<br/><br/>So the idea of asking these questions upfront is to give players the chance to go for option b in an orderly fashion.<br/><br/>Anyway, I agree this can certainly be something that could provoke some Blank Page Syndrome and take too long, that's why I made the questions this specific and asked them only after the setting is defined, since the more material you have to start with, the less prone the players would be to get the BPS. I'm also thinking more seriously of making a random mechanic to generate motivations, objectives, etc. if this still appears to take too long to do.<br/><br/>Also the objectives, motivations, etc in this game are supposed to determina an important challenge the PC will comfront, this is not like asking the players to write a short story about their characters backgrounds and never using it. I plan to enforce that mechanically just in case the player decides to forget about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378028">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Noofy" title="Noofy"><img alt="Noofy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/698/n8MS6M60RYOPX.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Noofy">Noofy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378028/#Comment_378028" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-12T22:26:01+00:00" title="May 12, 2012 10:26PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Rafael</cite>And, on that note, if there are any games that already do this, I'd love to know about it, because it would be cool to play a game like that.</blockquote>\nBurning Wheel - Adventure Burner Commentary.

Still, in my experience a game can make the most out of it in two ways:\n<ul>\n<li>Make this kind of character-prep the only prep, or at least the important cornerstone of all prep-work. For example, in <i>Sorcerer</i> you as a player have to come up with Kickers and lots of stuff about your character, but then the GM is supposed to put it all together in a relationship map and cook out a scenario from that, tying all characters together in the game the players want to play.</li>\n<li>Prep feeds back into the game mechanics, usually the character-advancement mechanics.</li>\n</ul>\nCan be both at the same time, of course, as is usually the case with TSoY/SS, for example.<br/>Anyway, it's still work! But it's work that pays off, so in the end it's OK. I still think it's good design to keep this kind of work down to the <i>minimum</i> your game actually necessitates, though.<br/><br/>"The minimum necessary" may actually be none: if we're playing challenge-oriented D&amp;D which focuses on dungeon-exploration, a la Eero, prep-work is autocratic and PC-agnostic, consisting in the DM designing a dungeon (or picking a module); then (assuming that we're all on the same page) it's a good thing that character-creation is quick and characters are inherently replaceable, otherwise it'd be prep-work on top of more prep-work!<br/>But you can have a completely character-centric game which takes very little character prep-work, as well: I think that <i>Dogs</i> and <i>The Mountain Witch</i> could stand as valid examples.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378125/#Comment_378125" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-13T17:35:56+00:00" title="May 13, 2012  5:35PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Do goals, motivations and such make characters easier to play?

(Here's a <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/2011/05/27/compliance-techniques-and-rpg-design-2/" rel="nofollow">link</a> to an old blog post of mine where I elaborate on this).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>I just mean I've played games where you come up with a lot of upfront character stuff, and games where you don't, and I haven't really noticed that it makes much difference to how easy or fun the characters are to play.

When goals or beliefs are a laundry list of abstract things you need to come up with before play begins I question whether they're good design. When used that way they're usually not there for the player but function as GM-facing flags (and if the player isn't really invested in them but is just writing something down to satisfy the letter of the rules to get to the actual game, they probably don't work very well as flags).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378166/#Comment_378166" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T05:45:33+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  5:45AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Paulo,<br/><br/>Those are interesting problems, and I've had similar problems myself.

Still, there's a minimum of unavoidable prep if we want to help players deal with first two problems listed.<br/>-Keeping the prep to a minimun and present it in a way that doesn't feel like work.<br/>-Players using goals and all the abstract parts of their PCs to obtain mechanical rewards in a way that could ruin suspension of belief.<br/><br/>Well, the easier way is to minimize all the issues stating that the chance of every problem listed happening in the same game is quite low, but that would be cheap. Now, the first two problems listed, as well as the last one, can't be solved until I find a proper solution for problems number 3 &amp; 4. Which are screaming "random generator" to me. I've done it before and I've seen Reign do it better (I havent' tried BW yet) and they certainly made creating a character feel like a game. Of course, if there are any bad outcomes players grow unsattisfied, and it gets worse if other players get better rolls. It's just a matter of making all variables interesting.<br/><br/>Still, randomizers have the habit of growing old quickly, so if you want to kepp the replay value high, the best option is to keep them general enough for the players to fill the blanks and precise enough for making easy to fill those blanks. So after going there at full speed let my rephrase my character creation process:<br/><i><br/>This is the Story of _________________, from the House of__________________, who set on a quest to ___________________________________________________________<br/>guided by his/her/the (choose one or roll 1d6) ____________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/>1) Sense of Duty<br/>2) Desire of Glory<br/>3) Thirst for Justice<br/>4) Search for True Love<br/>5) Greed for Power<br/>6) Search for the Truth<br/><br/>Struggling against his/her own (roll 1d6)_____________________ she/he confronted_______________________________________________(main threat of the setting of your choice)<br/>1) Wrath<br/>2) Greed<br/>3) Sloth<br/>4) Pride<br/>5) Envy<br/>6) Lust/Gluttony (choose one)<br/><br/>Your house thaught you how to (list 3 skills) You learned how to (list next 3 skills) to impress_______________ and you trained thoroughly to master (add special skill) to defeat_______________ (your nemesis)</i><br/><br/><br/>Hmmm ok, it still gives BPS signals, but defining the setting first should help a bit, and a list of skills separated by class should help players overcome it.

A:  PC have goals and players are rewarded for achieving them.<br/><br/>b) wah!

One is that players invest in the setting: the relationships of their PC with certain NPCs, places, creatures and monsters should matter to them. Having players create or influence these makes them a big deal, so whenever these "player creations" are endangered, it's only natural that the game turns epic if players have to make risky gambles to save them. The other thing needed is uncertainty, certainly provided by the system, though <br/><br/>Well, I still insist that the PCs should start the game with an objective, though I think that it can be created ramdomly so it doesn't feel like work. Once defined the objective, it also brings with it the first element of the fiction the player invests in. Another elements (up to five, including the first one) could be generated as the story unfolds and making these should bring an inmediate reward either in fiction (e.g. one of the enemy guards used to be an old friend of yours, something you can use to your advantage inmediatly) or mechanically (the guard used to be and old friend you betrayed and has a grudge against you, earn 3 luck points since he's a level 3 challenge now)<br/><br/>So now all I need is one goal (defined randomly, and which also defines the first motivation) and 5 motivations (first one defined by the goal and the rest to be filled by the player as the game progresses. These can either be benefficial in the story or reward players with Luck points according on how big an impedement they represent)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378499/#Comment_378499" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T13:21:14+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  1:21PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, now I get the flashback mechanics from 3:16, D'uh!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
