It makes the game more tactical, and we like our games tactical" or something similar. I'm in a group that doesn't really feel that way but loves the core system and the setting. So we're considering not using the advancement rules, and I wanted to ask about this.<br/><br/>1. What should we watch out for? What is safe to get rid of and what do we need to keep to make the game function? Our goal is to simplify play and minimize in-session record keeping.<br/><br/>2. We'd still like our little dudes to develop and grow - any suggestions for changing characters post-session? What's a typical amount of advancement in a full GM turn/player turn cycle?<br/><br/>I realize this isn't recommended but it seems like a good option for our particular group. I'd appreciate constructive advice related to the above two points. Thanks very much!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218203/#Comment_218203" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T06:14:14+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  6:14AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm following Jason around the Internet and cross-posting with him.<br/><br/>I'm running the game for this group, and thought a lot about this after-game last night. We're playing one season per session, so I think I can accelerate advancement a tiny bit without hurting anything. Given that, here's what I have so far:<br/><br/><b>Resources and Circles:</b> You can increase either of these by 1 by spending a Check in the Player's Turn and succeeding at a test. Not sure what the test will be, but I could go with whatever makes sense: tell me how you're increasing your Resources or Circles and then we'll figure it out.<br/><br/><b>Skills: </b>Choose a Skill at the beginning of the session you want to focus on. If you use that skill during the session, it goes up by one at the end of the session. I'd like to have some sort of limiting mechanism here, like "you roll against your Nature." Maybe that's what I'll use.<br/><br/><b>Beginner's Luck:</b> Only works on one skill per session, but it automatically becomes a skill of 2 at the end of the session.<br/><br/><b>Traits:</b> Adding, changing, or increasing a Trait requires spending a Check in the Player's Turn and succeeding at a test.<br/><br/><b>Instruction:</b> A successful Instruction check versus another player's skill they want to be instructed in increases that player's skill by 1. You must either have the skill at a higher score than the target player, or be assisted by someone who does.<br/><br/><b>MVP and Workhorse:</b> The group can decide to add a trait, increase a trait, or increase a skill or ability instead of granting a Persona point to the MVP and Workhorse. What the character change is is up to the group, based on how the character acted during the game.<br/><br/>I'm not sure how well this'll work, but it seems like it won't increase advancement by more than 1.5 times, maybe double. I'd love any advice on improving these ideas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218211/#Comment_218211" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T07:02:26+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  7:02AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2009 7:34AM by Doyce.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Editing to withdraw the stuff I wrote when I thought you guys hadn't actually played the game yet.)<br/><br/>Hi guys,<br/><br/>I'm not sure why, if you're not comfortable with the advancement system, you want to instead speed up advancement to make it happen more (and via hacks).  Maybe think about that, because I'm not sure you want that.<br/><br/>Here's a few thoughts:<br/><br/>First and foremost: Jason mentions a desire not to do bookkeeping. <i>I think you've created more bookkeeping than the game itself has with these hacks.</i>  I accept that what's in the the game rubs wrong, but this stuff feels like more, not less.<br/><br/><b>The MVP and Workhorse hack:</b> players NEED those persona points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218212/#Comment_218212" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T07:07:43+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  7:07AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2009 7:14AM by Clinton.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Doyce, man - we played it last night. We played it for realz with all the rules. And we loved it! What we didn't love is some of the same stuff you love, and <i>that's totally ok</i>. You misread skill improvement - you'd roll against Nature (edit: in retrospect that doesn't make sense: what would you roll? Not your current skill). Trust me, I get how the system works, and I love it, and I'd use it with a group that liked it, but ours doesn't. Tracking successes and failures and beginner's luck checks is a total harsh in our flow. The hacks leave the exact same sort of things in play - Nature makes it harder to learn skills, player interact to gain Traits - without the paperwork.<br/><br/>I don't think you read our posts well: we've played it; we get it; we want to advance - in fact, a little faster, since we're playing 5 sessions, max; and the bookkeeping was too much for the group as a whole. With that said, I thank you for your input, and your points about Traits, MVP, and Workhorse are good points I'll think on. I know some of the group wants to change their traits before Winter - since it'll be either our last or next to last game - so I need a way to allow that. I also agree with you about failure: I need to take that into account, as it's one of the primary drivers of the game.<br/><br/>I could take bookkeeping on myself, so that I track people's successes and failures so they don't have to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218216/#Comment_218216" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T07:17:17+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  7:17AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2009 7:22AM by Doyce.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the clarification, Clinton.

This is WAY more complicated than the actual MG rules.  I mean, if you want to hack, no one's going to stop you, but you shouldn't do it under the pretense that you're actually making things easier.<br/><br/>In the 7-session MG game I ran this Spring, players simply checked boxes when they passed or failed checks but didn't approach things tactically at all, trying to get the right checks they needed and so forth.  As such, we had very little advancement at the end of 7 sessions.  Probably each character had two skills increase, no stat increases, and a couple learned a new skill the hard way (gaining it at the starting level of 2).  Consequently, our game was very explicitly not about mechanical advancement at all; it was an afterthought compared to the plot and character development (in a non-mechanical sense).  My sense is that MG characters only change mechanically, at least in the short run, through changing their Goals and occasionally their BITs (Beliefs, Instincts, Traits). The actual mechanical advancement of skills and stats is part of the long-form play of the game and we only saw a little of that happen. This is very different from stuff like D&amp;D and TSOY where you're earning XP or hitting Keys all the time.  Instead, doing that kind of stuff in MG earns you bonus dice at the time (for hitting Traits, say) or Persona / Fate points at the end of the game session, neither of which advances your character. Basically, the resource economy is completely different, much more about improving your immediate chances of survival / success rather than advancement.<br/><br/>Here's the other thing: Guardmice stats are very coarsely gained.  The difference between having a 3 and having a 4 in a stat or skill is immediately felt after a couple of conflicts. Tenderpaws and Patrol Leaders are worlds apart in feeling when you play them, just based on what you can accomplish mechanically, and that definitely adds to the feel of the game.  If you start increasing stats at a faster rate... all that is going to fall apart.  Mice won't be stuck at the same stat level long enough to get a sense of what it feels like at that level before bumping up to the next level.  The other thing that might happen, depending on how long you're planning on playing, is that single mice will eventually be able to solo weasels with no problem, and that, frankly, just isn't what the Mouse Guard setting is about.  It's about being small, fragile, and afraid of bigger animals.<br/><br/>So yeah, all of these sound like bad ideas to me.  If you really want a system that has constant chances to improve traits... maybe you wanna be playing something besides Mouse Guard.  A lot of the game, in my experience, is about making do with what you have, the limited resources and stats at your disposal, and just trying to get by on luck, grit, and, in many cases, pains and suffering (Conditions).<br/><br/>EDIT: Cross-posted with all that other stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218220/#Comment_218220" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T07:33:49+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  7:33AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, good point, and your experience lines up with Doyce's.

You could, for example, let players increase 1 skill after every two sessions or something, and limit it to whatever skills they'd actually used regularly, and that would be fine.

Honestly, if I run it again for new players, I want to make a new one that starts off only showing you the information you absolutely need, but I haven't gotten around to that yet. That said, the sheet definitely gets much easier as you become more familiar with it.  I mean, now I can <i>consider</i> playing BW after playing through MG and slowly becoming comfortable with how things work.  Previously, I would look at a BW sheet or the character burning guidelines and run for the hills.<br/><br/>EDIT: Jason, I am a bit confused about your comment on "state tracking."  In my experience, the numbers on the sheet change only rarely, with the exception of Disposition for individual conflicts.  There's a lot of stuff there, sure, but it shouldn't be changing states all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218240/#Comment_218240" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T08:13:59+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  8:13AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every time you test you mark the character sheet.

IOW go ahead and mark for each test -- you either succeeded or you failed, full stop, right? It doesn't seem godawful to make a mark next to the skill you just rolled. But what I'm suggesting is that the players just *forget* about chasing advancement, and figure it all out in the postmortem -- if you earned more checks than you needed to advance a skill, just roll 'em over.<br/><br/>We instituted something very similar to our regular BW game, and just log everything we do on the spot (skill, Ob, dice rolled, Artha spent) so we can get on with the getting on. Then afterward, we go back and see if something improved.<br/><br/>BW play philosophy derives some good play-juice from its various advancement systems -- mostly in the form of bribing players to take suboptimal tests -- but the check-earning system already does that in MG. I don't know that you really lose much by logging and advancing after the fact.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218246/#Comment_218246" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T08:38:13+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  8:38AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "no weasels" rule was employed liberally and frequently in my playtest group, to the point where the Patrol Leader actually got in a habit of delegating nearly all rolls in-character: "Tenderpaw, go set up those snares" to streamline it.<br/><br/>My recommendation would be this:<br/><br/>1) If you use a Beginner's luck skill, write it on the sheet and mark one of the tick-boxes;<br/>2) When you use a skill the first time in any session, mark one of the tick-boxes. Do NOT mark multiple boxes during the game (think like BRP/CoC/Pendragon);<br/>3) At the end of the session, each player can raise/open X ticked stats, where X is whatever you think is appropriate for the pace of advancement you want, probably 3 or so.

It was my first time running it, by the way.<br/><br/>We didn't use the advancement rules at all. I simply forgot. Things went fine and the players and I were able to get into a decent groove with the game with only some very minor bumps. The interesting part was that when we were done with the Player's Turn, the players asked me about the advancement rules. We talked about them, and I let them mark off the stuff that they could remember as far as skill and ability goes. It was kind of neat, as the stuff that was marked was the stuff that stood out for them and therefore interesting, it was a neat way to relive the story after the fact, and we didn't break the flow during the game. We still did the end of session stuff like the MVP and Workhorse rewards and it complemented it fairly well.<br/><br/>Now, that said, now that I've got a session under my belt, I am totally excited to have the players mark the tests DURING the game. I love the fiddly aspects of Mouse Guard, and I'm not too worried about the immersion. I'm going to let the player's imagination pick up the slack. I will be pushing them to keep up the pace, but I think the turn structure will do most of that work for me. <br/><br/>If you end up playing without marking tests during play, I think the biggest thing you will lose is that players will not be trying to get this or that failure or success on whatever skill that they are trying to increase. I think this is a very neat and subtle feature of Mouse Guard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218714/#Comment_218714" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T09:12:42+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  9:12AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your thoughtful reply, Jesse.
