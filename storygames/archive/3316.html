Quite new to this site and while I was "looking around", I came upon the definition of "story games", which revives in me some thougths.<br/><br/>As a reminder, the definition :\n<blockquote>:::A Story Game is a type of role-playing game or gaming experience with a lesser focus on My Character and a greater focus on Our Story.:::</blockquote>\nNow, I want to adress an issue, taking the angle of <i>plots</i> and not <i>rules</i>, as a way to oppose story games to adventure games. And, please, bear with me : I'll need "charitable" reading on this !!! Here it goes, but first, a little note :<br/><br/><i>I've studied philosophy (with a university degree to prove it) and personally, I'm an existantialist (to be exact, hermeneutic, but let's put this detail aside). This means that I am the master of my destiny, that my path is not already written, that my life has a meaning because it can be told, narrated, just like any story. But, my own existence is linked to a context, a history, a language. I can't understand my existence outside this context. I can't understand "my self", my actions, my decisions while ignoring the events of the world that surrounds me. It is also "them" who define who I am (well, quite obviously, I wasn't born in the middle age, I'm not a native english speaker, I can read, for instance). For me, it is the central notion of "sense" that is at stake here. Now, back to rpg.</i><br/><br/>I quite understand the critics toward the "adventure games" since, I must admit, I'm no longer really interested in that type of game anymore. Because the game is centered on the PCs, as if the whole world was turning around them ; because, somehow, their path is already decided, fixed in advance, as if the PCs had just to follow the flow of a river ; because the PCs do not dispose of the freedom that would allow them to really define themselves ; because, finally, they don't really own the key to their destiny ; because it is not really about "their story", but instead about their characters in the context of "a story". Well, I know, I kinda simplify things here, but I think you get the picture ...<br/><br/>As an alternative, there are the "story games" which, normally, needs very little prep and the absence of any prewritten plots. This time, the PCs get all the freedom they need to generate "their story", without constraints and restrictions. But, on the other hand, any kind of context is driven off. The events of the world cease to happen ; and the stakes are lower. How can we give sense to "our story" in the absence of "the story" (the one of the world) ? How can an existence be "read" without a context ? How can one justifies its actions and decisions outside the story of the world ? Once again, I know, I simplify things, but I believe you get the picture ...<br/><br/>So, in one hand, I have "a story", the one of the world, into which the players take part without freedom ; on the other, I have players building "their story" without any kind of context, outside the story of the world. As a DM, I feel some kind of insatisfaction in both cases ; as an individual, I have a philosophical problem with both. Is there some kind of alternative, some kind of middle ground ? That's what Avalanche is about.<br/><br/>To allow the players to build, to write "their own story", but inside the story of the world ; a world that lives, but asks nothing from the PCs, imposes nothing to them, especially a prewritten path. To give the players a freedom, but which takes sense, is "inside", "the Story". Of course, this objective needs a completly new approach toward the design of prewritten plots, which is at the heart of our project, and that I won't present here.<br/><br/>But, maybe the most important thing : does this conception changes our approach toward rpg, does it change the way we play, does it change the role of the DM, does it change the way the players apprehend the game and the role they take into "their story" ?<br/>To all of those, we believe the answer is "yes".<br/><br/>Well, I guess I could present "my solution" and its impact, but as I truly believe this is not the one answer, I'll let you express yourself on this !!!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75098/#Comment_75098" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-12T07:46:05+00:00" title="June 12, 2007  7:46AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I rather think that in my 'The Story' the Pc's have lots of room to make 'Their Story'/ I play fairly plotty DnD and i don't think that the PC's lack for choice ( Real game shifting/ending choice) <br/>\n<br/>\nI think you made a comparison with the idea that it's either or, when it's closer to a continous scale.

The "their story" is pretty much exemplified by the game Polaris, and no other games that I can think of currently, save maybe "Shock".  Even The Roach, Mountain Witch and PTA (once setting is defined) have context (perhaps because they rely on a GM, or because Roach has a definite "backdrop"?)  <br/><br/>The middle ground isn't really an exception, it's the day to day.<br/><br/>My example of running things "Story Games style" is the following, taken from some experiences I had back in college with AD&amp;D2e.<br/><br/>1) I joined some friends playing AD&amp;D. I was told to be a cleric. "The Party needs a cleric". I played a cleric. I journeyed together with the other players in a Forgotten Realms setting that was set up by the GM. We were offered some side-stories by the GM, which we snapped up on because there really wasn't anything more that we could offer (personal suggestions often didn't fit with the GM's plans, you see). It was one of those games that lasted a few years, drifting from one superadventure to the next.<br/><br/>2) Later, I joined a GM who was running AD&amp;D with a specific setup in mind. If you read "The Complete Thieves' Handbook", there was this campaign idea for an "all thieves' campaign", set in this thieves' guild set in a Persian city, where the evil city watch guard basically burned out, rounded up and killed the members of the thieves' guild in one giant raid; The PCs are the survivors".<br/>"I want to run THIS", he said.<br/>It had a starting point, the middle was ill defined, the end goal was clear, though: Liberation and revenge. The GM had a map of the major NPCs in his head, but we helped create some memorable NPCs as well.<br/>The players were encouraged to make characters that fit within this "story backdrop". Naturally, it was 3 thieves (2 rogues with different kits, one elven thief-magic user), and one fighter who "used to protect the guildmaster". We played weekly for a few months. Then we concluded, and moved on to the next campaign (IIRC, it was a Cyberpunk game).<br/><br/>That second game is the "middle ground" that a lot of us dwell in all the time. There was a GM focus and "story", and yet there was plenty of player input into the setup as well. Then the game proceeded into play. We didn't constantly pull out and create new shit from scene to scene, adventure to adventure, but rather just relied on the stuff we created earlier, and leaning on the GM to provide much of the coolness and catalysts.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> is "story games style". Not an extreme, but a pretty balanced middle. Thing is, I had played RPGs for about *7 years* before I realized that "#2" was even a possibility. Nowadays it may be Common Thought. In the late 80s, though, the model of gaming was "the really long campaign that never really ends until all your characters get to high level/skill and retire".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_75254">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75254/#Comment_75254" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T03:01:05+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  3:01AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, I think Andy gave out great examples (by the way, thanks a lot) !!! But before going into more details and explanation, a quick note :<br/><br/>I really don't want to do theory here. The terms I'm using, and how I use them, should be intuitive, understood thru common sense. What I'm aiming at is some thoughts about plots design, in the context of this "middle ground", how it influences the way we play and how can it produces a <i>product</i>.<br/>Also, I'm not saying that one way of playing is better than the other.\n<blockquote>The "their story" is pretty much exemplified by the game Polaris, and no other games that I can think of currently, save maybe "Shock".

That said, accoding to me, there is no context in "the Roach". There is a strong setting, of course, but context, I don't think so. By context, I mean <i>events</i>. This would mean for instance, for the Roach, that at one point into the story, two countries would declare war and some PCs might say "the hell with what we're doing and let's engage ourself" !!! Anyway, you don't play a campaign of the Roach, you play a game. That said, the absence of context here is very fine with me : the game is <i>not meant</i> to integrate that !!!\n<blockquote>My example of running things "Story Games style" is the following, taken from some experiences I had back in college with AD&amp;D2e.</blockquote>\nI like those, but I would add <br/>3) running a game with three words written down or, as E.T. Smith said in this <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3305&amp;page=1#Item_20" rel="nofollow">thread</a> :\n<blockquote>I find that a "DIY on the Fly" approach is working best for my games, where there's alot of room for improvisation and the story, the setting and the rules all grow over the course of play. Note, I am not advocating total improvisation, sitting down and starting from zero. I've tried that, and in the end it does not work.</blockquote>\nwhich might work very well for some people.<br/>Back to our issue.<br/><br/><b>Sense</b><br/>In 1), PCs take part, most of the time, in the great events in the world. The stakes are very high, maybe even saving the world. But, why are the PCs taking part in those ? Well, like Andy said, they don't have much else do. Can they understand what they are doing in the context of those events ? I guess yes. Can they understand why they are doing it ? No really. Well, at least, not with an answer that would suit me.<br/>In 2), PCs take part, most of the time, in events that concerned them, for which they care. The stakes are usually lower (saving themselves, a city ...). As opposed to 1), the middle being ill defined, the PCs have the freedom to act, to choose freely their path. In the middle, I guess there would be some "events" of the world (in the case Andy described, in the city) into which the PCs can relate to.<br/>In 3), PCs build their own story, with the DM, not necessarily related to the events of the world. Which may be the goal of the game.<br/><br/><b>Tools</b><br/>Here I'm taking typical and clich\xc3\xa9 examples.<br/>In 1), you've got some kind of setting (homebrew or bought) and a linear plot (that the PCs will follow), generally <i>chapters based</i>. Most of the details are already prewritten (each inn, innkeeper, secondary characters ...). Note, that in the case of a bought setting, then the setting is somehow <i>constant</i>, not defined for a plot, no stakes at hand.<br/>In 2), only the main outlines are defined, the setting is defined for specific stakes (but not always the case), much of the details are created at the table. But, there is still the presence of a frame, which, most of the time, is expanded (written) by the DM as the sessions go by. Events might be defined, but some incoherences migth emerge, as they might not be planned well ahead (example : among the persia guild member, there might be an "evil" one, who will try to confront the PCs, or assassinate the mayor of the city ... Anyway, all of the story of this character is not written in advance, only what occurs and not what exactly preceds it).<br/>In 3), generally, everything (almost) is created at the table with a mechanic strongly linked to a setting. Establishing coherent events seems to me like a very difficult task.<br/><br/><b>Products</b><br/>1) Classic setting available (<i>\xc3\xa0 la</i> Forgotten Realms), and chapters based adventure. It might be a prewritten plot or homebrew, but anyway, the chapters desing stand.<br/>3) One book, including mechanic and setting, closely linked.<br/>But, for 2) ? Usually homebrew, the DM takes a lot of notes before (rmap with the main characters, main events and locations) and during the game (all the details), build the plots and the setting session by session. But what design does he use ? How does he store the information ? Unless it is in a big mess ... And I don't think the classical chapters based design applies here : the PCs don't go thru chapters !!!<br/>Is there some kind of design specific to the middle ground ? Are there products (that could be bought) that respond to that specific need (allowing freedom, no details, only a backbone) ? It seems that many players are in this configuration, playing in this "middle ground", but what design are we proposing, what specific tools have we conceived ? Don't we have needs that we can express and elaborate solutions according to those ?<br/><br/>I think 1) and 3) are pretty much cover, but there is still a lot things to do about 2), no ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_75337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/75337/#Comment_75337" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-13T09:31:50+00:00" title="June 13, 2007  9:31AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Joshua, I think Andy gave out great examples (by the way, thanks a lot) !!!

It's just my ridiculous tendancy to justify myself !!! That said, for the purpose of this discussion, I would propose the following :<br/>Adventure : pre written part<br/>Story : improvised part (which may be build with or without the PCs)<br/>And a quick note : I think that what I'm saying mostly apply to the "campaign" type of games.\n<blockquote>It sounds like you're asking for stuff happening in the background that may or may not engage the characters -- the "events of the world" in your post. You cite Roach as being absent of this, which I might quibble (Homecoming, the Follies, the Winter Ball, etc -- but it seems you want bigger, world-shaking events). Is that correct?</blockquote>\nI think the important part is <i>may</i> or <i>may not</i> engage. This engagement (or lack of it) should have, in my opinion, some consequences. I'll come back to that.<br/>For the roach, I've just checked back the rules. As I see it, the events (convocation ...) are being proposed for the PCs to engage into it. Some PCs may or may not engage into them, but they don't seem to me as events who could "derail" you from your goals. If I'm not wrong, the game is being played around those events. Another thing, let's say no PCs ever take part in "convocation", would it be possible that something happened there (outside of the PCs' influence, since they are not there) that would have an impact on another scene ?<br/><br/>As for "world-shaking" events, what I'm saying doesn't necessary imply that, they don't need to be that "big". Well, maybe big enough to "shake your world", the size of it being different from game to game ("your world" could be a city, a province ...). But, maybe I'm not clear enough here ...<br/><br/>Let's say you want to play "in the middle", so I'll have some parts prewritten, and some not. Question is : "how much" adventure do you want ? "what kind" of adventure do you want ? Or, if you prefer "what is prewritten and how much of it" ? I think the answer to those is very structuring for the game. And, it should also influence the specific design use to "hold and structure" the prewritten part.<br/><br/>There is one problem I see : some people would say I want to play in the middle, so the DM starts with a rough "sketch" of a scenario with a ill defined middle. I guess, the adventure will developed from session to session (writing around the part the PCs are willing to explore). But then, the middle might be ill defined, but composed of many parts, each one being very well defined. And then, it comes back to pure adventure, or almost ... How can you give freedom to the players without working on the events they don't see, they don't take part in it ? A "world" restricted to the PCs view and actions, isn't it an adventure ?<br/><br/>Then again, as a personal preference, I want my game to be about "what is the PCs place in the world ?". That's what I'm looking for. But how could they answer this if the world is centered on them ?

You can have all kinds of stuff going on in the background of the "world", but until the players engage it, or it changes their goals, or otherwise affects them, it's pretty much just meaningless color.  As soon as any of that stuff going on in the world really <i>matters</i>, it matters only because the PCs/players have decided it matters.<br/><br/>To try to address your question, though, to the degree that I understand it, you can "prewrite" as much stuff as you want, as long as you can be resonably assured that the PCs won't have a chance to interfere.  If you try to "anticipate" player actions when writing events, or if you put too much investment into these events, then you easily run the risk of being tempted to railroad the players to "fit".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_76147">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/76147/#Comment_76147" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-16T19:35:57+00:00" title="June 16, 2007  7:35PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>Then again, as a personal preference, I want my game to be about "what is the PCs place in the world ?".

Well, at least, not with an answer that would suit me.<br/>In 2), PCs take part, most of the time, in events that concerned them, for which they care. The stakes are usually lower (saving themselves, a city ...). As opposed to 1), the middle being ill defined, the PCs have the freedom to act, to choose freely their path. In the middle, I guess there would be some "events" of the world (in the case Andy described, in the city) into which the PCs can relate to.<br/>In 3), PCs build their own story, with the DM, not necessarily related to the events of the world.

I've been out of town with no internet access for the last two weeks. So, anyway ...<br/><br/>Now, to begin, just a couple of things concerning this thread :<br/>- I really stink at presenting my ideas !!! I need to better myself, so thanks for your input.<br/>- My issue here is in the context of a campaign. I'm curently working on a plot related project and really believe there is much left to work around those.<br/>- Most of the time, "adventure" is opposed to "story" as games from a mechanic point of view. But I think the way the plot is written also matters.<br/><br/>And before starting the discussion, I'd like to mention what are my needs when playing a campaign :<br/>1. I want the PCs to have freedom, to be able to choose their own path, their own destiny.<br/>2. In this context, I want the PCs to be able to change their "center of interest" in the course of play.<br/>3. I want the PCs to be able to interfere with the plot ; change things.<br/>4. I want the PCs to be in a "living world", to get the sense it doesn't live only around them.<br/>5. I want the world to be coherent from a plotline point of view.\n<blockquote>I don't know how helpful a comment this is, but it seems to me that the game is always centered on the players.</blockquote>\nYes, Iagree, that's how it should be. But, when centered around the players, are they doing some adventures (just following a plot, with no real freedom) or are they building their own story ?\n<blockquote>You can have all kinds of stuff going on in the background of the "world", but until the players engage it, or it changes their goals, or otherwise affects them, it's pretty much just meaningless color. As soon as any of that stuff going on in the world really matters, it matters only because the PCs/players have decided it matters.</blockquote>\nIf the PCs engage into some events, then this plotline matters to them. But, if they don't care about the king's assassination, this event might still matter a lot to the kingdom and have major impacts. I don't think it is just color. Maybe a rude tyrant will take its place and then it will matter to the PCs and they will engage into it. Maybe the new ruler will engage into a war with a country whom the PCs care about. Well, of course, for some events the PCs won't care about it at all !!! But, in the process of writing prewritten plots, I can't take one or the other for granted.\n<blockquote>To try to address your question, though, to the degree that I understand it, you can "prewrite" as much stuff as you want, as long as you can be resonably assured that the PCs won't have a chance to interfere.</blockquote>\nBut I want to use the prewritten part, taking nothing granted from the PCs' part into it and I want them to be able to influence it ?! How do I do that ? See my solution below ...\n<blockquote>Since you're using the word "world" two different ways here, I've got some thoughts.</blockquote>\nYeap, my mistake. Let's give this a try :<br/>- The world : the sum of everything happening into a given space time continium. Now, for an hermeunetic, this doesn't exist, as it would suppose some kind of God's eye point of view. Now, let's say that "the world" would correspond to everything the DM knows. I'm not glad with this, but it will work for the moment.<br/>- Your world : things happening into a given space time continium from your point of view. It may be a subset of the world.\n<blockquote>Let's say my world is a treehouse. Our neighbor is lobbying to get our tree taken down. I'm taking part of that because, well, the treehouse is my world!

If the game and any related plot to it is only about the treehouse, then the world is limited to it ; and your world is more or less the world. If this treehouse is in the context of a bigger scheme, located in a kingdom on the verge on war, then your world is a subset of the world.<br/><br/>Post is too long, I need to split it ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_78886">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78886/#Comment_78886" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-30T02:32:05+00:00" title="June 30, 2007  2:32AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>This isn't some "lesser" event for us, because we care more about that treehouse than anything else.

If the world consits of two locations and three NPCs, well, maybe you don't need a specific design to hold any kind of prewritten plot. Maybe, you want play a campaign just about your treehouse. Now, one question : let's say the world is larger, but you don't care about it because you only care about your world, your treehouse. Let's say you save it and want to continue to play those PCs in the context of a campaign, thus starting to explore the world, expand your world. What had happened into it when you were saving your treehouse ? Was the world "on hold", waiting for you ?\n<blockquote>You could scale that up to saving Earth in a galactic game, or make it more personal be defining your world as "My burning vengeance for my father's unjust murder."</blockquote>\nLet's say you're playing a game where your PCs want to avenge it's father's unjust murder. Can you tell me that the events of the world won't affect your PCs ? Can you tell me your PC won't engage in anything else ? As I see it, to avenge your father's death is your priority. But is it ? Are there other plots into which you could engage, but decline ?\n<blockquote>What exactly is this middle that you're talking about? Games where the events of significance in the greater world don't happen to your character, thus there's nothing of significance?</blockquote>\nThe middle I'm talking about is the use of some kind of prewritten plot, defined before the game, and the use of creation at the table, not defined earlier. About the events of the world, you don't know beforehand if the PCs will engage into them or not. And even if they don't engage into them, it doesn"t mean it is of no importance as they might turn out be very important later.\n<blockquote>Why is 'adventure' not 'story', or vice versa? It sounds like a false absolute. Like Josh, I'd ask for some Actual Play example of what you're looking for, either real accounts or just give us an example of your ideal.</blockquote>\nFor me, adventure is the part prewritten. Living campaing, sold by TSR might be a good example of pure adventure : PCs have no choice, they can't derail from the plot. Everything that is provided is used. Capes, on the other hand might be an example of pure story.<br/><br/>As for an actual play example, there is one in my <a href="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/AvalancheTeaser_EN.pdf" rel="nofollow">teaser</a> (last page before the back cover).<br/>And here's more or less, how I do things for Avalanche :<br/>- Mapping out all the events that happen in the world without taking the PCs into account.<br/>- The use of multiple plots simultaneously.<br/>- The use of a calendar instead of chapters.<br/>Now, what does it change :<br/>- When the PCs decide to engage into a plot, it is their choice (and they have choices !!!)<br/>- This structure allows to specifically pinpoint the impact of the PCs.<br/>- Note that the PCs might change a plotline, but changing all of them at a given time is impossible.<br/>- It is very easy for the PCs to move from one plot to the other. They are doing something and meet another plot, change their priority and engage into something else.<br/>- Affecting a plot is possible, but it takes time. But, even if the PCs change a plot, there are still others provided by the product, so the DM can still use it.<br/>- When we play, we really work on their story, but in the context of a prewritten plot.<br/>- The world is evolving. Each time the PCs go into a major town, their first reaction is asking "what had happened lately ?" because those events, even if the PCs weren't there still have their importance : they have change the world.<br/>And, as this is a campaign, thus going on over a long period of time, there is no real events of no importance. Maybe something happened a long time ago, but the results are important and the plot still go on, based on those events that happened in the past.<br/>Well, of course, using this design, a DM will only use about 25% on the final product, but the resulting game experience will be coherent from a plotline point of view. And using so little is one of the reason I believe it makes a product : no one would be crazy enough to map out events, if they don't know if their PCs would engage into them or not. That said, there is a strong replay value to this kind of product, as everytime a DM plays it, the story will always be different (the PCs will explore a different part of the adventure).<br/><br/>Well, I hope I am clearer now ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_78976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/78976/#Comment_78976" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-01T06:17:08+00:00" title="July  1, 2007  6:17AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Y'know, notwithstanding the landslide of text that has been generated here:  I think you may have made a very simple, very critical misunderstanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt looks like you're reading "My character vs. Our story" as referring to the <i>characters</i> and their place in the fiction.

It's just "flavorful background noise" until the players <i>make</i> it matter.  To cite your example, maybe they don't care about the assassination.  The king gets replaced by a tyrant.  Maybe they don't care about <i>that</i>.  The tyrant starts killing off foreigners.  Maybe the they don't care about <i>that</i>.  Even if one of the PCs is a "foreigner", the player might just have his character leave the kingdom, uninterested in that confict.

If you mean that the PCs have stakes at heart, their own, which drive the story forward, I can't agree more. And if you mean, also, that the "story" should be generated thru a shared process, I can't agree more (that said, in a living campaign, I'm not quite sure there is room for this, given how it is produced). And, the "world" is not the responsability of one person, <i>but</i> ... in the context of a campaign, there is only one person <i>who brings something to the table</i> (a prewritten part), the DM. My concern, in this context, is : what do you bring ? What do you consider useful ? How do you manage the information ?\n<blockquote>It doesn't matter what cause and effect background events have at all until the players choose to care about them, thus, the perception that the world exists for the PCs, because it does.</blockquote>\nThen again, I agree ... But how can you know <i>beforehand</i> what will interest the PCs (unless you wish to railroad, given no alternatives to the players) ? Then, maybe <i>some parts</i> of what is prewritten, using my design, might turn out to be "flavorful background noise". Personnaly, I'm ready to take that chance ... because some parts, some events, will generate care from the players. But, then again, as I said, this is why this design might turn out to be a product : as a DM, writing my homebrew campaign, will I write down events, which I'll only used at 25-50 % ? I guess not ... But a product which would provide me with that, why not ?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79255/#Comment_79255" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T08:17:56+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  8:17AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>And, the "world" is not the responsability of one person,<i>but</i>... in the context of a campaign, there is only one person<i>who brings something to the table</i>(a prewritten part), the DM.

You seem to think that the distinction between focus on "My Character" and focus on "Our Story" has something to do with that question ... and I just don't see the connection.<br><br>If you want to talk about how fast-prep games can or cannot facilitate the creation of a rich and engaging fictional world, that's cool.  I'll happily discuss that.  But I don't think it has <i>anything</i> to do with the quote that you led with.  Does that make sense?<br><br>Anyway:  On fast-prep and rich world.  I don't think that a fictional world is created during prep.  I think that what prep does is create the <i>structure</i> that people will thereafter use, during the game, to create the details of the world.  So if you've got a long monologue on the cultural mores of the G'Brakh people then the GM and players have enough information to very easily create the actions and attitudes of a G'Brakh chieftain.  The preparation gives them a structure of generalities which helps them to create the specifics.<br><br>The question is whether a <i>very small structure</i> of generalities can lead people to easily create a rich and diverse set of specifics.  Obviously this is going to be down to the creativity of the group on some levels, but let's assume that we're talking about "all things being equal" ... how will the same group do with (a) a large structure of material and (b) a small structure of material to work from.<br/><br/>My take is that a small structure can still do a good job, <b><i>but</i></b> only if it is very, very carefully organized indeed.  The Town Creation mechanic in [i]DitV[/i] is my go-to structure for this:  It is small, rigidly formulaic, and <b>spectacularly powerful</b> at creating a skeleton that leads to rich, vibrant towns filled with detail and passion.<br/><br/>Another way that you can structure things is to cheat:  You pull in a <i>really large structure</i> from popular media or culture.  <i>Primetime Adventures</i> does just this ... it provides a large structure to help people create a world, just by saying "Think of it like a TV show."<br/><br/>You sure don't get these structures by accident, though.  I'll grant you that in a heart-beat.  If you just say "Okay, here's my prep:  The sky is green.  People travel around in air-barges powered by Steam Hamsters.  The Khanate is deeply politicized.  There, we're set!" then you make a game where it is very, very difficult for people to create new details of the world.  They have to do it from whole cloth, without meaningful guidance.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79287/#Comment_79287" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T09:53:04+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  9:53AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My solution to the challenge identified by Tony (and maybe the challenge pells is curious about) lies in identifying player-flags and then building the situation out of those.

That's an interesting question. You seem to think that the distinction between focus on "My Character" and focus on "Our Story" has something to do with that question ... and I just don't see the connection.</blockquote>\nYes, I'm talking about DM's preparation ... and yes, it is connected to this !!! What I'm saying exactly is that <b>plot does matter</b> ...<br/>I think we can agree on our problematic : our goal toward a play experiment (sharing the creative "narration"). So, to acheive this goal, I truly believe that what you bring to the table (the prewritten part), and how it is structured really makes a difference, as it may help you or hinder you. For instance, if you come to the table with an old d&amp;d module from TSR (linear, chapter based adventure), will it help you attain your goal ? I don't think so !!! This model doesn't correspond to my need !!!<br/>That said, if you allow me an <i>apart\xc3\xa9</i>, when I first discovered the indie scene, I was playing almost freefrom, thinking that any system could do anything. Some people told me I was thinking that because, somehow, the mechanic came in the way of what I was doing, so I just decided to throw it away. But I was soon to discover that system does matter. A little bit to the image I just described, I think that for most people, they reject any kind of prewritten plots because it comes on the way of what they are doing. What I say to that, is that plot does matter, and there are ways to generate prewritten plot that do not come in the way.\n<blockquote>The preparation gives them a structure of generalities which helps them to create the specifics.</blockquote>\nI can't agree more here Tony !!! But beware, I'm mostly talking about plots here and not setting. That said, I'm a truly believer of the link between plots and setting !! I don't believe in a setting without a plot ... and does that exist outside of rpg ????\n<blockquote>The Town Creation mechanic in [i]DitV[/i] is my go-to structure for this: It is small, rigidly formulaic, and spectacularly powerful at creating a skeleton that leads to rich, vibrant towns filled with detail and passion.</blockquote>\nI'm so glad you bring this up !!! Yes, DitV is the prefect example of a structured plot design : simple, easy, effective. But, note two things :<br/>- This design is truly a <i>container</i> and impose nothing for the content. That's also my aim.<br/>- This design corresponds to the <i>need</i> of this game : short ones. I think it would be difficult to use this design for a campaign, as the needs are quite different.\n<blockquote>Another way that you can structure things is to cheat: You pull in a really large structure from popular media or culture. Primetime Adventures does just this ... it provides a large structure to help people create a world, just by saying "Think of it like a TV show."</blockquote>\nThen again, nice analogy. But let me ask you a tricky question : would you use the same design for a TV show like <i>desperate housewifes</i> and <i>24</i> (or to some extend <i>the wire</i>) ?<br/>I'm bringing up <i>24</i> on purpose here, as its narrative structure quite looks like <i>Avalanche</i> : it is multi plot, calendar based. One thing also you could notice about this : suppose you "adapt" <i>24</i> for a game, then which part will you use, in which story will you engage ? Are you ready to say that all the others are just background noise as they cross over each other later on ? Also, when you jump into a story, the time would be very important : where is the plot up to ?\n<blockquote>You sure don't get these structures by accident, though. I'll grant you that in a heart-beat.</blockquote>\nYeap, that's for sure !!!! Then again, my needs are very specific, the context also, the one of the campaign, but I'm quite sure there is a lot to come with ...<br/>For information, here's my specific <a href="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/blog/index.php?m=20070128" rel="nofollow">design</a>, which I find quite simple and light. Then again, it is truly a <i>container</i>.<br/><br/>And two last things :<br/>- I'm really, but really, interested into the metatime (the time elapsed in the game world). This is a real concern for me for the credibility of the game play.<br/>- Of course, we're talking about DM's prep, but I'd like to separate two things : the time needed to create a product and the time needed to prepare a game using this product. Creating Avalanche is a very, very, very long job to do, but preparing a game with it is quite short, because of it's structure ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79480/#Comment_79480" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-04T11:11:50+00:00" title="July  4, 2007 11:11AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>So, to acheive this goal, I truly believe that what you bring to the table (the prewritten part), and how it is structured really makes a difference, as it may help you or hinder you.</blockquote>Gotcha.  I think the early emphasis on "How much preparation?" was perhaps a little misleading.  You don't seem, really, to be taking aim at <i>prep-light</i> games ... rather, you are taking aim at <i>prep-inadequate</i> games.<br/><br/>A game that gives you rapid, light prep structured in such a way as to provide you everything you need in order to play ... that's cool by you, yes?<br/><br/>Contrariwise, a game that takes days and days to prep <i>and still</i> doesn't provide you everything you need in order to play ... that's not so good, right?<br/><br/>If you want to object "In the rush to lighten preparation, people often fail to have their rules create plot, and that sucks" then I'm right there with you.  I think that those things do often go together, and that's a failing of the systems involved (<i>Capes</i> most definitely included).<br/><br/>But that's a very different thing from your initial objection of (roughly) "Prep-light games can't have rules that create plot, so they suck."

I've never said that !!!! Quite honestly, if I want to play a small game, in one session, I won't really care about "the PCs finding their place in the world". I'm not looking to simulate a <i>living</i> world. Games like <i>Dogs</i>, <i>capes</i> or <i>Shab-al-Hiri Roach</i>, in my opinion, doesn't respond to the same needs, the same objective as playing a campaign. Those are games that really light prep ; which is perfect for those games !!! What I meant is that if you use a very light prep, similar to Dogs in the context of a campaign, you'll come to the problems I mentionned above. I'm not saying "light prep games suck", but "if you use the design of a light prep games to build the plot of your campaign, then it will suck !!!".

But, if I'm not wrong, "plots" or "events" are not part of the big model. Am I wrong ? Are they defined ?<br/>I'm saying that what you bring  to the table, as a DM, in the context of a campaign (or, well, maybe, in any context), does matter ; that it will have a definite impact during play ...<br/>Can I propose a little change in your definition of plot ? I would say : "the events the players <i>may</i> participate in during play" ; as some events may happen outside the PCs' influence. Otherwise, it would mean that any kind of prewritten plots means that the PCs will take part in them, which bother me, since I don't know beforehand what the PCs will want to engage into. Otherwise, I'm afraid to railroad.<br/>And, to respond to your question, I'm saying : <i>I want a strong foundation for an engaging plot as the best way to create a good situation</i>.<br/>Thus, I want to be able to focus on "our story" during a campaign by using "the adventure".

Maybe a problem of terminoly !!<br/><br/>I'll just start with some definitions :<br/>Events : <i>something</i> happening <i>somewhere</i>, with <i>some people/races/objects</i> involved, at a precise <i>moment</i> (ie time).<br/>The problem I see with the term <i>situation</i>, understood thru the big model, is that it involves the PCs ; unless I'm wrong !!<br/>Now, as for <i>plot</i> : a sequence of events, happening in a given order, in a definite timeline.<br/><br/>As for an example, I'll try this :<br/>Then again, I'll use my <a href="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/AvalancheTeaser_EN.pdf" rel="nofollow">teaser</a>. I must admit, it is not the best playable example, but still you'll see the design. Note that any black and with illustration, associated with its text, represent an <i>event</i>. Events follow each other, in a given order, on a given timeline. This is the structure. I think it shows the prep is very short, the stuff provided to the DM very light ; a backbone upon which to build ...<br/>Now, to have a full extend of the plot of Avalanche, here's the related <a href="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/relationship_map_EN.jpg" rel="nofollow">rmap</a> (the characters present in the teaser are in the upper rigth corner) and <a href="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/img/maps_world.jpg" rel="nofollow">the map of the region</a> (sorry, the quality is not good, it's in french, but the crest of the world is on the middle right).<br/>As you can guess, much goes on there !!!!<br/><br/>Now, about plot. PCs begin to play, engage in situations, which, once resolved, become events. Once, many events succeeded each other, on a timeline, it becomes a plot.

So, you're asking for a low prep-time method to create events in the fictional world that the PCs don't care about?  Why would you do that?

I'm looking for a design to "hold" prewritten events into the fictionnal world, that will allow, that way, low prep-time.<br/>Well, then, why would I do that ??? Would the PCs care ??<br/>Let me just restate (briefly) my initial statement :<br/>I'm looking to bring something to the table (ie a prewritten part) in the context of a campaign that will allow me to build the story of the players (that's why we are there playing !!!). Typical prewritten plots are linear, thus prohibiting me (and my players) from the freedom we need to express our choices (find out our place in the world, truly experimenting a kind of existence, in the philosophical sense, a freedom that is anchored in a context ... blablabla, see above).<br/>And, by the way, on low prep : the idea is to focus on what you need. Are your PCs any how near the summit of the world <i>for the time being in the game</i> ? No, then you discard the events of the teaser. You can easily pinpoint what concern you.<br/>From my point of view, it is not worse than the typical : meet the wizard, accept the mission, kill the monster, free the princess, discover the wizard is bad, kill the wizard. Those are all events, by the way ... and the PCs are supposed to engaged into them in a <i>specific way</i> !!!<br/>If I want to go with "plot light" scenario (only a backbone, no details), along a timeline, over a long period of time (calendar based), then I'll come with a multi plots campaign. Well, if all my plots are boring, not engaging ... I guess I have a BIG problem. But the idea here is to provide enough room for the PCs, with very different kind of stories (high adventures, political intrigues).\n<blockquote>On a potentially constructive note, perhaps you could roll on a "situation generator" (something like the Oracle from In a Wicked Age or the maybe something you write up specific to your source material) but have it happen to other NPC characters.

And by the way, yes, the PCs do not take part in the events provided in Avalanche ... <i>yet</i> !!! This is done that way, because I don't want to take for granted any intentions/actions from the part of the PCs beforehand.<br/>Look, I'm the author of Avalanche, this is a campaign, but I can't tell you what your game will be like !!! Honestly, it's impossible !!!<br/>They go in there, in a <i>living world</i>, do their things, find their place in the world, take sides, come to build up their own story ...

Yes?<br/><br/>Fantasy roleplaying is usually about fantastic stuff happening in fantastic settings.  When you play or GM, you know you're hitting your own personal target when there's fantastic stuff happening.  Yes?<br/><br/>Now, you like both of these things, and they seem to be similar: fantastic stuff happening in fantastic settings.  So you want to talk about these two great tastes together.  How best to write about fantastic stuff happening in fantastic settings <em>and</em> roleplay through fantastic stuff in fantastic settings, using the same-or-similar fantastic stuff and fantastic setting material?<br/><br/>Is this accurate, or am I barking up the wrong tree?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_80656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80656/#Comment_80656" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T11:42:27+00:00" title="July 11, 2007 11:42AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Is this accurate, or am I barking up the wrong tree?</blockquote>\nYou're barking at the very right tree, Joshua, but I'd really like to explain a couple of things before answering your questions ...<br/><br/><i>A quick note : strange as it is, this thread is near covering all aspects of my project. Is that good or bad news ? I don't know. I just really hope that my discourse is readable. On the following, I'm going to talk a little bit about myself, my interests, where I'm coming from. For one thing I really want to avoid any kind of clich\xc3\xa9s (about the doomed author) and I hope this will help to understand my aim.</i><br/><br/>Now, this is my opinion about the current status of typical role players (not indie one, the one I used to be) ; feel free to object. I believe that people who wants to play a campaign, basically, have two choices which requires the buying of a product (hey, I know, those are rough sketches !!!!) :<br/>- Read a book, see a movie ... whatever !!! Get a source of inspiration, a plot/setting (remember : a setting without plot doesn't exist !!!!) which he finds cool and then adapt it for its game. But, the initial product is not meant for the rpg. It provides many, many details, which, at some points, may hinders you. It provides you with a point of view, main characters that you follow. Dealing with a game that would go outside those bounds might be hard to come up with.<br/>- Buy a rpg campaign (or something like that). Well, we know our old chapters based, PCs centered adventures (with the plots being sold as a separate product) ; prefect railroader. Are we happy with it ? Not me !!<br/>I guess there is always the "do it yourself", but then, what do you bring to the table ? How do you manage the information ? Not an easy answer ...\n<blockquote>How best to write about fantastic stuff happening in fantastic settings and roleplay through fantastic stuff in fantastic settings, using the same-or-similar fantastic stuff and fantastic setting material?</blockquote>\nI'd rather say "how to write specifically for the rpg ?" ; to provide a non directive source of inspiration. A product that would work like the movie/book I mentionned above but that don't need any kind of adaptation : it is already written for the rpg ... and, without the drawback of the typical scenario.\n<blockquote>You like writing about fantastic stuff happening in fantastic settings. I mean, regardless of whether players will interact with it in a game, that sort of thing is fun for you. Yes?</blockquote>\nIs writing Avalanche fun ? Yeah !!! It's not a novel, and this is very important. I wouldn't write a novel : you need to come up with a lot of details. It's a long shot !! With Avalanche, an event is a 200 word text. The breath of writing is very easy. Now, about "fantastic" ... not especially !!! I like to write/create plots, intrigue. From a higher point of view. By the way, this is also what I like to read/watch. I'll come back to that below ...<br/>But, maybe another very important thing about writing. I like to discover new kind of narrative structure (how to you tell a story ?). For instance, you don't tell a story the same way for a novel, short stories, manga, TV series, comics, movies ... That's what I like and that's why I'm "eating" a very varied menu of cultural items. But even so, inside each categories, there are new things appearing. I mentionned earlier 24, bringing a completly different kind of story telling. But also, in novels, Cerventes, Musil, Kafka, Gao Xingjian and so many others manage to find new ways to propose a plot.<br/>Also, I read the newpapers (I spend two hours a day on this), <i>Le Monde</i>, the most renowned french one. And this is relating maybe the best story, in its own way : our own, the story of our world. And this is, again, multi plots calendar based !!!<br/>Of course, without comparing myself to the above material, I think a find a way with Avalanche to narrate a story in a new way. I don't see any product that looks like this. Or, maybe storyboards, which are, by definition, unfinished product, not meant to be sold as a product. And this makes sense I think : Avalanche is meant to be completed by the group.\n<blockquote>Fantasy roleplaying is usually about fantastic stuff happening in fantastic settings. When you play or GM, you know you're hitting your own personal target when there's fantastic stuff happening. Yes?</blockquote>\nWell, not really fantasy (in fact, I hate reading fantasy !!! Except maybe <i>A song of ice and fire</i>, you'll see why). I want to read/write/take part in a good plot !! A plot, give me plots (my kingdom for a plot) !!! And I want it coherent. I want to see things at the beginning, discard them as unimportant and see them coming to my face months later !!!<br/><br/>Well, sorry for the long post, but this is the tree you're barking at ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_80670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/80670/#Comment_80670" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-11T12:29:10+00:00" title="July 11, 2007 12:29PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2007 12:32PM by Josh Roby.">edited July 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First, a little language difficulty: by 'fantastic' I don't necessary mean just the stuff that you'd see appear in the fantasy section of a book store.  I mean stuff that only happens when you fantasize about heroes and intrigue and stories and whatnot.  Which sounds like what you're talking about.<br/><br/>Here's the kicker for me, S\xc3\xa9bastien:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>How best to write about fantastic stuff happening in fantastic settings and roleplay through fantastic stuff in fantastic settings, using the same-or-similar fantastic stuff and fantastic setting material?</blockquote>\nI'd rather say "how to write specifically for the rpg?"<br/><br/>From my perspective, you're not really asking how to write for an RPG; you're asking how to take <em>this thing that you already enjoy doing</em> and make it useful to a roleplaying game -- or in this specific case, to story games.  You keep coming back to the question of "what do you bring to the table?" with the assumption that you have to bring something to the table.<br/><br/>It's like you have a ball that you really, really like, and you want to play a specific kind of sport... and you want to use your favorite ball in this specific sport.  So you're on the sideline with your ball asking, "how does my ball figure into this sport?"  And I'm not saying it doesn't -- maybe you brought a basketball to a basketball court.  But also, maybe you brought a baseball to a basketball court.  Maybe you brought a basketball to a baseball diamond.  But as long as you keep insisting on fitting your ball into the sport, you're going to have trouble understanding the sport on its own.<br/><br/>Because what I don't see you talking about is <em>how the players interact at the table while playing the game</em>.  (And it's important to note that by 'players' I mean the GM, too.)  In a story game, all the players are involved in creating a story together.  They do, hands down, need some tools to do this.  Maybe the stuff that you like to write would be a useful tool.  But I don't think you're going to find out if it's useful, and I'm <em>positive</em> that you're not going to be able to optimize what you write so that it's even more useful, until you put your writing aside and look at what's happening at the table.  If you want to answer the question, "how to write specifically for RPGs?" then you need to <em>look at RPGs</em>, not your writing.<br/><br/>I think you've got a very powerful insight here on the nature of publishing for roleplaying games:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>I think a find a way with Avalanche to narrate a story in a new way.

And this makes sense I think : Avalanche is meant to be completed by the group.</blockquote>\nNow, the question is: <em>how</em> does the group use the published material to 'complete' Avalanche?  What do they do?  What do they look up?  What numbers or descriptors or maps or whatever do they use in their mechanics?  What bits do they change through events in the fiction?  Which bits do they change because it makes a better story?  What parts do they outright ignore?  Perhaps most importantly, what things do they use from the book that actually hamper their creativity but they keep doing it out of some sense of 'doing it right'?  The big question behind all of this is: what do the players need (gauged by <em>what the players do</em>, not what we designers <em>think</em>), and how can you provide for those needs?<br/><br/>You have a hammer -- not everything is actually a nail.  The trick is figuring out what really is a nail, what things require different tools, and if you can or should provide those tools.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/pells" title="pells"><img alt="pells" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.cycles-rpg.com/teaser/avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/pells">pells</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81049/#Comment_81049" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T04:01:55+00:00" title="July 13, 2007  4:01AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>From my perspective, you're not really asking how to write for an RPG; you're asking how to take this thing that you already enjoy doing and make it useful to a roleplaying game -- or in this specific case, to story games.

And just a thing about it (and I know I keep repeating it), what we're saying here, is that <i>plot does matter</i> !! I think most indie designers (including myself) will agree that system does matter. But plot ? I think we are somehow in unchattered territory here ...<br/>I believe we need to adress this issue just like with systems. If I want to play dungeon crawl, then TSOY might not be the best pick. If I want to play Dogs or Capes, then the design I'm proposing might not be the right pick.<br/>When I say "how to write specifically for RPGs?", I mean "how to write specifically for RPGs <i>according to your needs</i> ?" <br/>I've stated mines (context of a campaign, working on our story, with freedom, tought anchored in a strong context to fully give consistence to an existence). My design is really <i>coming from the table</i> ; mine. The design for the towns that Vincent proposes for Dogs correspond to its needs, at his table.<br/>I can't answer the questions of needs concerning plots for others. But I think its importance is understimated and I wish more people would think about it.<br/>Just like systems, Avalanche is not meant for all kind of play ; but I think (hope/guess) that it does well what it's supposed to do.\n<blockquote>Now, the question is: how does the group use the published material to 'complete' Avalanche? ...<br/>The big question behind all of this is: what do the players need (gauged by what the players do, not what we designers think), and how can you provide for those needs?</blockquote>\nTo a question like : "what do characters do ?", my answer is "I don't know !!!" ; and I'm not kidding !! This is due to two things :<br/>1. Avalanche is not about <i>systems</i>. In fact, when we'll launch it, it will be released multi systems : d20 (under the OGL), TSOY (with a specific adaptation for Avalanche, under the right licence) and Fudge (we have not begun on this system yet). Depending on the system chosen, the game will be very different.<br/>2. Avalanche is, on purpose, not about the PCs. So, they have a lot of freedom and can even play the bad guys (like the black orcs). So, given their initial role, the game will be about very different things. But even that aside, what will the game be about ? Avalanche is multi plots, so the game can be about very different things. Maybe the survival of the human race against a very strong foe (the white orcs), maybe about stopping the raise of a demon, or the quest to repair injustice, freeing village dwellers against their oppressors, or about a civil war ... and it can be about <i>some of those things</i>. <br/>As for what they might change, they may change everything in fact, but still, it depends on their interests, the sides they choose. But remember : changing things takes time and in Avalanche <i>time does matter</i>.<br/><br/>That's why I like to say that Avalanche is about finding your place in the world. Taking sides. For one thing : PCs will explore the lands of exile for a given time ; they will "evolve" in a <i>living</i> world, a world that moves, that doesn't wait for them, that expects nothing for them. A world that has depth, that has a strong coherence in its various plots.<br/><br/>I like to think of Avalanche as, somehow, an homebrew campaign, but providing something that no one would dare to do itself : mapping out all the events of the world, even when PCs are not there, but that will assure a coherence into the plot when the PCs get there.<br/><br/>I know I didn't answer all your questions, but I hope I reassure you on my aim ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81092/#Comment_81092" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-13T10:02:46+00:00" title="July 13, 2007 10:02AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite><i>plot does matter</i>!! </blockquote>Does it?

And it really changes things ; or at least I think so. For instance, would you prepare a game of Dogs using the old D&amp;D module design (chapters based, taking for granted the actions of the PCs) ? I think you wouldn't get the same game.\n<blockquote>Everything is about system (not to be confused with rules). ...</blockquote>\nSo, you agree with me, right ? I mean, I'm kinda of stuck, because much depends on the mechnic used ... But I see you coming : "you need the system before creating the plots". Well, more or less. Avalanche is about many things, many different kinds of situations. So, I guess that depending on the mechanic chosen, the PCs will tend to interact more with some kind of stories (for d20, I think PCs will more be like to go rescue the villagers or confront the white orcs rather then take part in the political intrigues in the south). Anyway, maybe they'll use d20 for political intrigues, and it might not be the right choice ...<br/>And I know that all stories presented won't interested any one group !!!\n<blockquote>This is perhaps misleading. Are you saying that the game isn't about the PCs (because honestly that sounds kind of bad) or are you saying that the setting isn't focused on the PCs (because I think that most settings usually work that way anyway).</blockquote>\nI agree about the setting, but Avalanche is about plots in a setting (the two components can't be separated). What I'm saying is <i>if you want the game to be about the PCs, the prewritten part shouldn't be about them</i>.\n<blockquote>S\xc3\xa9bastien, you kind of sidestepped the question: what's in the book that the players need in order to play?</blockquote>\nJoshua, you're right and I'll try to be explicit. Let's see what Avalanche provides :<br/>- A complete setting for a context (around 40 characters, 20 locations, 20 races, 20 organisations, 10 main items, some "monsters")<br/>- Description of those elements using different systems<br/>- A calendar based plotline (divided into weeks, for a year long, around 30 events provided for each week)<br/>- All elements (characters, races ... and events) are illustrated<br/>- Maps of the main cities and the region<br/>- A graphical interface that will allow you to access all those datas thru a database, where DM will be able to quickly access the information, manage the impact of the PCs on the plots and incorporate the story of the PCs (using events on the calendar).<br/><br/>Now, what would you really need ? It depends on what the PCs do, their starting point, their interests, <i>the part of the web of the events they explore</i>. Think of Avalanche as fiction written for the rpg, relating everything that goes on in the "world". You won't use everything.<br/>A general note about Avalanche : you have to it as a product containing <i>layers</i>. The main layer is the plot. On top of that, you've got illustations, maps, but also systems.<br/><br/><b>The existence thing</b><br/>Quite franckly, this is the main point of this thread (building our story within the adventure). Yeah, I know, this is not a common idea. But do you get what I mean ?<br/>For me, as an individual, finding sense, my place into the world, giving constency to my <i>persona</i> is a real problem !!! And that's also what I'm looking for when playing a rpg <i>campaign</i> (and not when playing a single shot game or a gameboard, for instance or MMORPG).<br/>Of course, you can always tell me "I don't care about the events of the worlds". Well, your players can stay at the inn, if they want to !!! Just like in life, you can stay in your parent basement, not caring about what's happening !!! I mean, no offense toward anyone here, but that's not what I'm looking for !!!<br/>If you follow a little bit the events in our world (the wars, politics, global economy, global warming), can you tell me it doesn't affect your life, the way you think ?<br/>Now, of course, I'm not a major actor in our world ... But in a rpg campaign, I hope PCs will be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_81646">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81646/#Comment_81646" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T07:19:02+00:00" title="July 17, 2007  7:19AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that this is a terminological problem, one that was hit on above, but not then recognized as the problem.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlot has two meanings, even in general use.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The course of events as they play out through a story.<br/>\n2. The course of events that are planned by the forces involved.<br/>\n<br/>\nExamples:<br/>\n1. The plot took a sudden turn when the main character decided to off his partner.<br/>\n2. The madman had an evil plot to take over the world that started with offing the main character's partner.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe first is what folks who do theory often use to refer to plot, because it's in the context of player empowerment to create in play. The same folks (Josh, myself, etc.) would more often use the term situation to indicate not only the plots of the evil madman, but also just what characters are present, and anything else about the setting that's indicated as being immediately present.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe question of whether or not they have anything to do with the PCs right off the bat is irrellevant. They will have something to do with the PCs at some point, or there will be no play, however. For instance, in Paranoia, the "plot" or "mission" that the players are assigned has nothing at all whatsoever to do with the wants and needs of the characters directly - the computer doesn't care about them. But it will become important to the PCs, or Green Vulture Squad goons will descend upon them and make it important to them.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, from this perspective, everybody agrees that a "Plot" as a set-up for interesting things to happen, is a great idea. What we all also all agree upon is that a "plot" where the GM decides what the PCs will do before hand is a bad idea.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's leave the term plot behind. What we all want is the same two things. Some interesting set of creative elements that are presented to the players so they have something to react to. And then an allowance of the players to deal with those elements as they see fit. Then the elements respond as would seem likely. And the players respond again, sending the course of events in yet new directions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis back-and-forth is, I think, what we're all in agreement should exist. When people hear me or somebody else say, "There should be no plot!" it's shorthand (I usually describe what I mean here in more detail) for, "Do not pre-plan the course of events in any way that assumes certain decisions being made by the players."<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, that being the case... is there really any difference in what's being suggested and what is usually meant by "story" here at Story Games?<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81718/#Comment_81718" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-17T10:33:18+00:00" title="July 17, 2007 10:33AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: pells</cite>S\xc3\xa9bastien, you kind of sidestepped the question: what's in the book that the players need in order to play?</blockquote>\nJoshua, you're right and I'll try to be explicit. Let's see what Avalanche provides :<br>- A complete setting for a context (around 40 characters, 20 locations, 20 races, 20 organisations, 10 main items, some "monsters")<br>- Description of those elements using different systems<br>- A calendar based plotline (divided into weeks, for a year long, around 30 events provided for each week)<br>- All elements (characters, races ... and events) are illustrated<br>- Maps of the main cities and the region<br>- A graphical interface that will allow you to access all those datas thru a database, where DM will be able to quickly access the information, manage the impact of the PCs on the plots and incorporate the story of the PCs (using events on the calendar).<br><br>Okay, now how do the players at the table actually make use of these resources?

And note that I am aiming at "plots as a product" (ie sell something), which quite changes things for me. Quite honestly, there are not many people in the plot trade anymore those days ... That said, back to "how you do it".<br><br>Let's take your madman plot for example. My first question would be "is this the only thing happening in the world ?" Because, if so, then you at least take for granted that the players will want to interact with it ... and if they don't, well, you've got a problem. Also, it still restricts their freedom, or so I think. My idea is to describe the madman plot one way or the other and add <i>while</i> plot X is happening <i>at the same time</i> and <i>while</i> plot Y is happening <i>at the same time</i> and <i>while</i> plot Z is happening <i>at the same time</i> ...<br>Doing this, you get two results in gameplay :<br>- You assure that the PCs have some kind of freedom, maybe they are interested in the madman, or X, or Y or Z<br>- PCs will need to decide what are their priorities : they can't do X, Y and Z ; they must make choices !!! Also, nothing prevents them to change during the course of play, leaving X behind and jumping into Y suddendly. But since they happen at the same time, you'll need a specific design to manage this ...<br><br>On the other side, the DM won't use all that is written. If the PCs are interested and take part in X, most likely all of Y won't be used. But ... sometimes the PCs may come across some parts of it (or effects from some parts behind acheived).<br>But, this doesn't mean that Y or Z are only "bakcground noise". For instance, in Avalanche you have a plot, concerning the north, about the raise of the "dark heart of nature". This plot goes on for about 7 months before resolving. If the PCs don't interfere, the dark heart infests the forest in the north, attacking the men there. After that, their forces would grow toward all forests present in the region, including the south. If the PCs always stayed in the south for this time, they won't get what is happening and won't be able to react correctly (or at least, they'll spend time to understand). Things would be different in they got interested in that "background noise".<br><br>Mikes, do you see a difference in what I'm proposing (all theory left aside) ?\n<blockquote>Okay, now how do the players at the table actually make use of these resources? How does the use of these resources affect the experience of play?</blockquote>\nRessources used are linked to the choices of the PCs. Maybe you'll use more the north, or the south ... whatever in fact. But, remember, Avalanche is only a backbone : the DM and players will need to work together to make it come to life ; to add flesh to the bone. The calendar aspect is maybe the most important thing : the DM will need to use it !!! The PCs come to a town in weeks X ? Things that are happening are not the same as in week X-1 or X+1.<br>One of the main effect of the calendar is to have a living world. Once the players have understood "the trick" about Avalanche, they will always be asking, when coming to a new place "what had happened recently ?" and they ask to NPCs "what are you going to do ?". Once they understand that no one is waiting for them, that if they want to change things (for plots they care about) they need to be proactive, that the world continues to evolve while they follow one plot, I believe they get interested in what's happening, in what's coming next. "While we will spend one month doing this, what will happen elsewhere ? Is this really what we want to do ?".<br>And because of the calendar, time becomes an important ressource : if they spend one week or one month doing something, it changes their possibility to interact with the various plots later.<br><br>Do you think that what I'm proposing affects the game experience ?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_81996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/81996/#Comment_81996" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-18T09:25:31+00:00" title="July 18, 2007  9:25AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            S\xc3\xa9bastien, thanks -- I think I finally get what you're going after.
