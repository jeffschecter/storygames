I found this game quite charming. The subject matter is very serious (burning a witch is, after all, a very deliberate act of murder), and lent itself well to drawing the best out of the players. Dave's haunting rendition of the witch Elouise helped set the tone for the story. I played Ham, the unreliable guide. I had a surprising amount of fun playing the role of an anti-hero coward. It turned out that my "Ham" was really someone else, who had replaced the murdered original, and was leading the procession into a trap. When the trap failed, Ham even managed to avoid discovery, (barely) outsmart his companions and get away. We had an amazing surprise ending as Brother Armond actually <i>replaced</i> an innocent Elouise at the stake.<br/><br/>I also played <b>Muse</b> with my co-workers. We're playing a <i>cosmic horror</i> game in which the Elder Gods have bound Azathoth (the insane, blind watchmaker creator god) to human form on Earth. Meanwhile, the Great Old Ones are plotting to release Azathoth from his binding, and somehow Azathoth's human-seeming grandson Avery is a part of their plans... We're still at the early part of the story, but it's shaping up to be a good one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479668/#Comment_479668" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-13T18:48:48+00:00" title="January 13, 2019  6:48PM">January 13</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Started to play <b>D&amp;D 5E Lost Mines of Palvander</b>.

They came up with some hilarious characters and got through three weeks of school and character creation in our 3 and a bit hour session which is a pretty good pace I think. <br/><br/>This one will hopefully be more of an ongoing thing so I can work out some best-practices for campaign based gming for the game. The game is meant to have on overarching mystery peppered with school drama (Skunko was forced into a duel with someone who was bullying them and nailed a roll to use the spell they were learning that made people blurt out their most embarrassing secret, which was very effective in front of the gathered crowd). One thing I want to do is set up some guidelines for the gm to be able to generate a mystery on the fly, so I'm seeing how that works out by trying it myself. <br/><br/>So far the threat has been introduced: some sylvan spirits have been angered and are violently possessing the Thornwood tree and the animated Broomstick servants. I've just been winging it so far but now between sessions there might be a little bit of prep to set up some red herrings and find out who or what is behind the disturbance.<br/><br/>The session also highlighted a couple of incomplete mechanics so I'll have to work on them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis" title="wdavidlewis"><img alt="wdavidlewis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/256/nEGTDPV2N4H5B.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wdavidlewis">wdavidlewis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479745/#Comment_479745" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-15T20:26:08+00:00" title="January 15, 2019  8:26PM">January 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In some alternate timeline, this week I ran <b>Call of Cthulhu</b>, <b>DnD 5e</b> and a two-shot of <b>Dogs in the Vineyard</b>.<br/><br/>But over the last four days, they all fell apart due to illness, scheduling conflicts and MLK weekend travel.

Thorny Games came and ran some of their games as well as some other games that focus on language. <br/><br/>First, I finally got an opportunity to play <b>Dialect</b>. We played the Martian Outpost setting and had a lot of fun creating corporate babble. I want to think about how I can bring the language more to the forefront next time I play. I felt like we created a very cool story, but I also felt we didn't focus enough on our dialect. <br/><br/>I also got to playtest their upcoming game <b>Xenolanguage</b>. I won't say too much because the mechanics are still in development, but it was an excellent game mirroring the premise and structure of the movie Arrival/"Story of Your Life".

One of the Questions is, "Will Ozzy find his grandson Avery?" For those not familiar with the mechanics, until the Question is formally answered, no-one is allowed to narrate the answer. This creates a lot of back-and-forth where plot events might make it more or less likely that Ozzy finds Avery without Ozzy actually finding him (or definitively losing him).  This has led to some pretty funny in-game moments, like: (1) Ozzy sensing that his grandson was in danger, teleporting to the scene, not seeing Avery immediately behind Ozzy, and Ozzy blasting the attacker in annoyance and teleporting away again, and (2) Ozzy using magic to track Avery and continuously arriving to Avery's location moments after Avery left. I'm sure Ozzy felt a bit like Fievel in <i>An American Tail</i>.<br/><br/>None of the other players is a gamer, and at the end of last session one of them asked me if it would be "OK if he played the game on his own with his cousins."

It's my first time with the game, which I picked up recently for a little cheaper than the retail price (one player had played it once before).  We had a great time, and it forms a fitting end to a few lovely months of playing in-person with this all of this group. One of the players is moving to Taiwan, unfortunately for the rest of us. This has been one of my favorite groups to play with ever, and this game was perfect for us and the methods of shared collaboration we've developed. <br/><br/>We had five players, which means each round takes a while, but we ended on Castle Stormguard after about four hours. One player was the fugitive from Stormguard, and that helped create a great climax. (The player moving the Magus left it up to a die roll to see which way we'd go at the first fork in the road, so off to the castle we went.) We're going to try to get another couple of hours in next week, though there's no way we'll get to explore the entirety of the map. We might try finishing it up over Roll20, but that means missing out on the lovely physical components.<br/><br/>The other gaming for the week was on Roll20, discussing an upcoming game of <i>Day After Ragnarok</i> (<i>Savage Worlds</i> version).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479903/#Comment_479903" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-21T16:28:28+00:00" title="January 21, 2019  4:28PM">January 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Since last I checked in...</b><br/><br/>Three sessions of <i>Nerves of Steel</i><br/><br/>So much goddamn Monsterhearts, mostly in my Kingsport setting; finished runs of Kingsport 1943, and a season of the f2f game at the meetup.<br/><br/>Recently:<br/><br/><b>Alas For the Awful Sea</b>: I ran <i>The Wind and Rain</i> starter adventure.

The player of a crone-like character, who had the bad habit of cackling uncontrollably when witnessing murder, narrated how the angry mob picked on her as a way to vent their hostility and she was burned as a witch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479975/#Comment_479975" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-01-24T17:32:42+00:00" title="January 24, 2019  5:32PM">January 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Very interesting!

The group was made up of two first-timers and one of my longtime gaming co-conspirators. The first adventure is a super-simple little dungeon crawl - enter abandoned manor / retrieve macguffin / flee - but with hooks enough for me to parlay it into a bigger thing given sufficient player interest. The experienced player in the group played a bard, which was great because it allowed him to help out the party/move stuff forward with utility spells, while not taking up too much spotlight during combat (and thus allowing room for the new folks to take action in response to combat's clearer cues). The new players were great participants and seemed to have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The one big house-rule I used was to drop traditional initiative and instead run initiative in more of a dungeon-world way, as someone on here suggested <i>(sorry, can't recall who...2097?)</i>.  While that's worked great for groups of more experienced D&amp;D heads, it seemed to create "when is it my turn?" questions for the new folks. So, probably back to boring old regular initiative next time.<br/><br/>And I get to run Torchbearer for the first time on Sunday! Very excited!<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480125/#Comment_480125" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-02T05:44:22+00:00" title="February  2, 2019  5:44AM">February 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/milesgaborit">@milesgaborit</a> Excited to hear about your first Torchbearer run!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge" title="Demiurge"><img alt="Demiurge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/684/n5EMN506IRUMS.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">Demiurge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480138/#Comment_480138" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-02T20:39:13+00:00" title="February  2, 2019  8:39PM">February 2</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 2, 2019 8:42PM by Demiurge.">edited February 2</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On Monday, I played <b>My Life With Master</b> with some of the folks on this board. The sneaky GM created a scene where my minion (whose monstrous trait is that he is extremely aggressive) was forced to nearly murder a small child. One of the other PCs stepped in and gouged out my minion's eye! Ouch! Great scene, though. The third minion ended up in a struggle to steal a tiny amount of gold from a town person (due to a request from the Master), only to have the Master furious at him that he brought back so little gold. It was a really great session!<br/><br/>On Wednesday, I played <b>Muse</b> with my coworkers. Last session, one of the players couldn't make it and we played without him. When he read through the synopsis of what happened, he kept saying, "What?!? Who came up with this one?!" and every time it was me sheepishly raising his hand. In our plot, one of the main characters (Avery) is the grandson of Azathoth (the blind idiot creator god), which puts him in potentially the same power bracket as Cthulhu. We hadn't specified up-front what Avery's powers would be. I was inspired by an old anime whose name I forget to have Avery get frequently, gruesomely killed, only to get up moments later completely unharmed. Of course, after having criticized me, the newly-returned-player went ahead and narrated more gruesome Avery death scenes during Wednesday's session. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480141">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480141/#Comment_480141" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-02T21:07:20+00:00" title="February  2, 2019  9:07PM">February 2</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">@Demiurge</a>,<br/><br/>Nice synopses; it's great to hear your <b>Muse</b> game is ongoing.<br/><br/>I recently reread our notes/synopsis for our game of <i>Inconceivable!</i>... it's quite a rollercoaster!

I didn't know what it was when I declared this, though, so we had a Discovery phase where we learned more about the illness (a nanite plague caught from some pre-Singularity batteries the PCs were salvaging) and what they were going to do about it. In the end, they went to a space station and learned the nanite plague was a self-replicating terraforming engine that could wipe out life on a planet and replace it with something else. The space station's inhabitants wanted this super-weaponto crush their enemies, but the PCs realized they weren't to be trusted with that sort of power. <br/><br/>So there was a cool action/chase sequence where they were pushing hospital gurneys through a space station as laser fire rained down around them and the cyborg drained the air from the spaceship to take out the guards onboard, giving them the opportunity to flee with the nanite superweapon in hand.  What will they do with this new weapon in hand now? I don't know, but I look forward to next week when we'll find out.<br/><br/><br/>I need a good list of science fiction-y names and NPC quirks to use when making up NPCs and locations on the fly, because my world-building has been less than stellar.

There\u2019s a plethora of players out there wanting DMs, so after just a bit of screening I got 5 players who were willing to put up with my savage house ruling of 5e :-) I changed alignment, XP, initiative, and inspiration, among other things. <br/><br/>Two of the players are new to role-playing, and seem to be enjoying it so far, but it\u2019s been so long since I\u2019ve been a beginner that I worry if I\u2019m treating them as best I can. I do try to make sure they\u2019re not overwhelmed with rules technicalities. The newest player is still a bit shy about participating - for example she mostly stayed out of the recent dragon encounter.

I think character generation was too random and 'unfair' for his story gamey style. He especially hated that he had only 1 HP. In actual play he played his PC brilliantly but not really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Several other ItO GM had similar experiences!<br/><br/>One easy solution could be to not play ItO with these people.<br/><br/>Another one is to add some kind of procedures which does not change the rules but add more backstory, depth or personality to the character. I was suggested to take a look at MazeRats and I will...<br/><br/>But in the end I think its okay to say that heavily randomized murderhoboing (even if it can be played in a very educated, highbrow style) is not for everyone!<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480268/#Comment_480268" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-09T22:53:33+00:00" title="February  9, 2019 10:53PM">February 9</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2019 10:53PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited February 9</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Don't be afraid to spin off new threads for discussion, everybody!

Embracing unusual and strange characters as a play challenge and then being prepared to see them die early on is a big part of the "aesthetic" and the fun in a game like that.<br/><br/>There are two approaches I've seen which work well: either (1) to embrace the random and hilarious joy of characters dying with appalling regularity (see below), or (2) to take a hardcore stance where a tough starting situation like a character with no useful skills and 1 hit point makes you grin with glee: now there is a REAL challenge for your skills!<br/><br/>The best illustration of this playstyle I've seen is here (it's very amusing to read!):<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18249/the-osr-in-vivid-colour-an-actual-play" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/18249/the-osr-in-vivid-colour-an-actual-play</a><br/><br/>Adding more backstory, depth, or personality to the characters will make the problem *worse*, not better, as it will make character death sting even more.<br/><br/>The general conceit in this style of play is that characters don't have backstories and detailed personas... they have to earn those in play! You get to "create" the character through play, in other words, instead of doing so *before* play even begins.<br/><br/>Having said that, low starting hit points are one of the most commonly house ruled elements in OSR games (as you can see in the link, above). My favourite solution is to use "quantum hit points": instead of rolling your hit dice at character creation, you roll them when you get injured for the first time. This preserves all the features of the game's design (doesn't change any of the rules, really!) but doesn't leave anyone feeling dejected because they're going into a game with 1 hit point. That's what I do when I play OSR-style D&amp;D!<br/><br/>Having said <i>that</i>, however, <i>Into the Odd</i> is far more forgiving than most OSR games (and Maze Rats is far more lethal!), because your hit points are much less important than the damage you take to your stats. Starting with 1 HP isn't really all that bad in <i>Into the Odd</i>; it's a fairly reasonable proposition, in fact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480290/#Comment_480290" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-10T23:00:29+00:00" title="February 10, 2019 11:00PM">February 10</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ran the end of part 3 of Our Ladies of Sorrows, and we're unsure whether or not it makes sense to run the coda.

Ha! That's the Mantra of Evil if ever I heard it. Meanwhile, the Master seemed to be off sightseeing somewhere, which gave our characters all the time in the world to pump our contacts for all the Love we could muster. This cost my character Bush all the money he had, and with looming debts still on the horizon, he'll probably have to go back to the Master soon for his pay cheque... <br/><br/><b>Muse:</b> Avery's adventures continued. He ended up meeting Gaea, who had awoken from her long slumber to prevent Azathoth (bound to human form as Ozzie, as you may recall) from finding Avery. All these encounters with the supernatural started awakening Avery's cosmic powers, and he found the whole thing rather overwhelming. He worked on securing his dream job at GOOgle (the headquarters of the Great Old Ones), and they hired him and then immediately tried to sacrifice him in a ritual to break Azathoth's binding. The ritual failed when Avery didn't die after multiple stabbings. Avery went back home to start his sweet telecommuting job and found himself a first date!

Luckily, they were characters with a hell of a lot of baggage to work through. <br/><br/>The Wyrm and the Serpentine in this game are a lot alike in many ways. They're both the golden children of their respective families, laden with a ton of expectations. Both of them are violently protective of their friends. Both of them have supportive (if somewhat suffocating) families with piles and piles of bloody skeletons in their closet. Both of them are the last hopes of their respective species (Dragons and Snake People), as the time of the Serpent has long since past and the time of Dragons is waning. <br/><br/>All of last season though, fate found them thrown against each other. Their families have warred for centuries, and the suburbs of mount pleasant were built on the theft of the Serpent People's ancient holdings, and the murder of their allies. Meanwhile, Mount Pleasant was built to be a lasting legacy for the Dragons: a perfect community that could serve as a model for humans to improve their kind. A sort of societal hoard whose pristine order clashes violently with the monstrous and archaic impulses of the Salazar clan. <br/><br/>They've thrown barbs at each other, schemed against one another, and on one fucked up occasion that involved memory alteration and brainwashing slept together (although the Serpentine and the Wyrm both later decided that they were okay with that last bit, even in the face of the mind-magic). That changed in this session, as they came together to fight a common foe and bonded together as friends. But they're worlds apart, and the enemies they share are family. <br/><br/>I can't wait to see if this messy, unstable friendship can endure. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480482/#Comment_480482" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-18T05:44:21+00:00" title="February 18, 2019  5:44AM">February 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played in a session of OSR B/X D&amp;D; scions of an ancient family returning to reclaim some of their heritage in an abandoned magical city.<br/><br/>There was lots of hilarious roleplaying and eventually we found our way into a factory... which has been turned into a hellish prison by some bizarre gargoyle-like creatures.<br/><br/>We were caught and two characters died (but survived for the moment due tonight the use of a Death &amp; Dismemberment table), while the rest of us were getting overwhelmed, looking like a likely TPK.<br/><br/>We agreed to surrender, while two of the characters struggled to swallow keys we had stolen earlier - when we play again, it will be as prisoners of the hellish jail.

I have some thoughts...and some <i>feels.</i><br/><br/>First thought: Dang! Those Wheel Burners know how to build some tight mechanical loops! And whereas gaining skill/mastery in Burning Wheel takes time (by virtue of fiddly-ness and opacity of some of the mechanisms), the feedback that the system provided to the players had them learning and adjusting their play style pretty quickly. This meant I was really able to just focus on evocatively running and describing the 'dungeon' (a cursed manor in this case) - I didn't have to make sure I was telegraphing a sense of danger or uncertainty to the players, as the mechanics were generating that in spades.<br/><br/>Second thought: I understand "Twists" now! The way that Twists were explained in Mouse Guard just didn't penetrate my brain for whatever reason. But reading (and even more so, running) Torchbearer it clicked for me that <b>Twists are just Hard Moves a la PBtA.</b> That is, a Twist is a consequence/outcome/bit of narration from the GM that is so punishing that you need a failed die roll to justify it. Not sure if this makes me want to run Mouse Guard now (still not super into how mission-structured it is), but it was a satisfying thing to figure out.<br/><br/>Third FEEL: I don't think I like being a punishing, strict referee to players. Like, running TB is fun and satisfyingly game-y, and I like that the system allows you to "play hard" by giving the players plenty of tools and gauges. It felt fair. But I'm not sure "fair" is what I'm looking for - I much prefer "generally collaborative, if gently adversarial" as a GM stance. I found myself feeling a little guilty after the session ended. Will definitely play a few more sessions to wrap up the cursed manor adventure, but probably won't stick with TB for anything longer term.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lord_mordeth" title="lord_mordeth"><img alt="lord_mordeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/779/nVHN5533YB3PT.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lord_mordeth">lord_mordeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480606/#Comment_480606" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-20T15:48:33+00:00" title="February 20, 2019  3:48PM">February 20</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 20, 2019 3:49PM by lord_mordeth.">edited February 20</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/milesgaborit" rel="nofollow">milesgaborit</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Third FEEL: I don't think I like being a punishing, strict referee to players.

Don't. The system is mean for you! Meaner (not harder) than any other fantasy RPG I know of. You need to be merciful.<br/><br/>"Be a fan of the player characters" is still very much in play here. In fact, it's more important than ever. The mechanics in TB do a great job of being mean about survival. The GM's job is really to put a light at the end of the tunnel and help the players reach it <i>despite</i> the rules. When they get a taste of that hard-won success, that's what hooks them.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/milesgaborit" title="milesgaborit"><img alt="milesgaborit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/747/nVUCQU91ZGMO9.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/milesgaborit">milesgaborit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480625/#Comment_480625" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-20T21:11:36+00:00" title="February 20, 2019  9:11PM">February 20</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I dig that Mordeth. I just kept feeling like I wanted to 'pull my punches' when dealing out twists and consequences...like I was really reluctant to 'allow' the system to be as mean as it is. I felt personally culpable, and it wasn't really my jam. <br/><br/>That being said, I like the concept of "The GM's job is really to put a light at the end of the tunnel...", and am wondering if leaning into that role next time I run TB might increase my enjoyment / decrease my guilt. I'm definitely already being a fan of the PCs (IMO that's the only way to GM, except in very specific games/circumstances), but the idea of actively trying to convey to players "your actions are driving progress to your goal!" seems a little different - and is something I'm v. interested in trying to do.

Now it\u2019s them constantly bugging me about playing again.<br/><br/>We played 3 Sessions of Dungeon World, doing all the fun fanatsy cliches from meeting in a tavern to evil wizard tower and sky castle.<br/>The party are a Bard, Thief and Barbarian on a quest to save the realm from an evil wizard.<br/>What suprised me how quickly the players got a hang of it. Especially the Bard, who uses her specials moves to create flavor and lore for everything. In the second session she even started a map without any prompting on my part.<br/>Playing with people new to the hobby is one of my favorite things, especially when you can see the moment were they \u201eget it\u201c .<br/><br/>Another observation I made while playing is that this is the first time Dungeon World seems to be working for me. I always felt it quickly fell apart when you tried to do anything that wasn\u2019t strictly fantasy and DnD tropes. But for playing a sort of theme park game, doing all the fun cliches, seems a perfect fit. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480700/#Comment_480700" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-02-22T15:01:32+00:00" title="February 22, 2019  3:01PM">February 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice!

The Great Old Ones were pulling out all the stops in their attempts to kill Avery and release Azathoth from his binding. This included mind-controlling Avery's date so she ripped out his heart (<i>literally</i>) and murdering almost the whole pantheon of Elder Gods while they plotted around their war table. This latter event opened Pandora's Box, and things were getting pretty heated on planet Earth (in the boiling oceans sense). Yikes! The other players are expecting me to win the Climax Question (the final contest of the game) and narrate an unhappy ending for everyone. <img alt=":p" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/tongue.png" title=":p"/>  Just because I did that last time...<br/><br/>I also played our Yukon Gold Rush-flavoured <b>My Life With Master</b> campaign with friends on this forum. My character Bush (a former lawman) got orders from the Master to capture a native man and his cyborg son (the boy Bush had injured got turned into an alchemical cyborg to save his life). We had a cool gun battle between Bush and the father. This put Bush in direct conflict with another PC yet again, this time Galilee the tortured young boy that can smell honest gold. Galilee actually held Bush at gunpoint (!!) while the family got away. Then Bush turned the tables, handcuffed Galilee to a post and took off after the family...<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to more!<br/><br/>--Jonathan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480934">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480934/#Comment_480934" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-04T03:20:10+00:00" title="March  4, 2019  3:20AM">March 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dreamation!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">@Adam_Dray</a> sorry I never actually got to talk to you there.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>  Sounds like you were a busy man!  So glad you were able to make it; I know that had been in doubt.<br/><br/>Here's what I played:<br/><br/><b>Masks</b> wide-con.  I remain very impressed with the quality of the Masks playbooks.  This was the second time I've played, only this time with 16 other players, and all the playbook options were still stellar.  <a href="/forums/profile/Brendan_Conway">@Brendan_Conway</a> has done an amazing job of breaking "teen superhero" into so many fun and different flavors.  As for the wide-con, it was neat to get in a little game time with so many different people, and the sense of so many characters active in a shared world was neat... but rather than being a 16-hr plot broken into 4 simultaneous chunks (which sounds awesome in my head), it was more like a 1-hr plot with lots of filler for the characters to separately tackle before reconvening for the next plot point.  What we did in the first 3 rounds was fun, but it didn't strike me as terribly consequential.  The next plot point was gonna be the thing the organizers prepped, regardless.  I missed the 4th round, though, do to catching a train which proceeded to strand me in the middle of nowhere.  Now I know why NJ Transit gets such a bad rap.<br/><br/><b>Thousand Arrows</b>.  I dig <i>so many things</i> about this game -- glad I backed it on Kickstarter!  The color, the 4 elements as stats, the variety of playbooks, the default minions and the moves you use to deploy them, the territory covered by the basic moves, etc.  I envision this game as something I'd want to use for PvP with a good amount of politicking, and I was initially a little underwhelmed by the session premise of "escort heir to throne while ninjas attack you".  But that's not how things played out at all!  Everyone at the table just dug into the characters and situations hard, and in the end some serious arcs were explored and completed.  The character Drives and the relationship questions we answered created a nice blend of reasons to work both together and at cross purposes, and although there was no PvP combat, we definitely struggled with each other plenty over goals and plans and loyalties.  In the end, the irresponsible heir forged a connection with her estranged family through the honesty and dedication their retainer showed her in the process of exorcising the ghost of her brother who was haunting a pirate ship.  And the retainer repaid her debt to the family, a debt incurred by participating in the robbery that got the brother killed in the first place.  And the pirate got his ship un-cursed, which (as revealed at the end) turned out to be the reason he'd accepted the "transport the heir" mission in the first place.  Just a killer session.  Big shout out to Brennan Taylor, Nicolas Hornyak and Jason Hill. <img alt=":grin:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/grin.png" title=":grin:"/> <br/><br/><b>Ten Candles</b>.  The Rapture arrived in blackness aboard a cruise ship.  Only the innocent children were worth saving in the eyes of the otherworldly "divine"... and only once all the adults had been shown the light and then sacrificed.

Three sessions for three different games.<br/><br/><b>Facing the Titan :</b> I ran a demo of my GM-Less game, where we face Lofituina, the Horror of the Deep. 5 players (counting myself), and this demo proves me that 6 players is too much and that I need to limit (in the presentation) the game to 5. I also need to have a "cooperative" roll for players to act together on a scene. Great demo, the "mini-universe" runs well and some modifications following the last demo have been applied with success !<br/><br/><b>Ghosts without Master :</b> My "dark-fantasy" "Castlevania / Dark Souls / Ravenloft / ..." hack of Swords Without Master runs well. But it was not suited for this session which is special during this con : Random Players to Random Table. The group I got was very beginner, or not used to narrative games. The start of the session was hard, the players had difficulties to see what they could do. But it went well in the end. Not great. Just well. The characters were "Nonamed" trying to bring down a "Dark Lord". The session started with the Lord in a coffin, trapped, and the characters travelling to see the Judge, an antique being who could kill the Lord. So people said. The journey featured a bridge hard to cross, fire skeletons, a strange marsh, a time loop, and the Lord awakening and trying to kill the Judge, who was trying to kill the characters for bringing the Lord. The last scene was great : one of the characters was in fact working for another Lord ...<br/><br/><b>Fiasco :</b> "Tales from Suburbia" is one of my favorite playset. It always makes great games. This one was one of them. Kentucky. A preacher, his wife who likes dogs very much, the widow who helps at the parish, a grumpy security man (working for the lady) and the car-repair man, link by some blood with the preacher. Also an old lady with a lot of money, a video of dog love, many old secrets, and an ending in blood. One dead, one fugitive with a memory loss, an assassin in prison, and two people losting their marbles.<br/><br/>A great con, with fresh new faces, old ones, and a very good finish.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_480964">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480964/#Comment_480964" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-04T15:03:49+00:00" title="March  4, 2019  3:03PM">March 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those are some great writeups (particularly those last three posts)!

Had a couple of planned games not been cancelled I think I would have averaged one game a day for about two weeks <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> <br/><br/><b>Good Society: Belligerence &amp; Benevolence</b>: This game produced some of my favorite RPing in a long while. We ended up drifting a bit into a story of queer lovers trapped in a social situation that could not accept them, basically discovering what <i>War &amp; Peace</i> would have looked like if it was written by Evelyn Waugh. The last session ended with a devastating 90 minutes of recriminations as five people tried to reconcile how much they loved each other and how much they hated what they had done to each other. And then there were heartwarming epilogues! I loved this game.<br/><br/><b>Sagas of the Icelanders</b>: This is going much better this time around. The Monster, a Saxon, is going around murdering his former owner's family, pulling everyone into a whirlpool of blood feuds; our especially scheming Gothi is stirring the pot too.<br/><br/><b>The Bat Hack</b>: We're the members of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League! I liked my character, Julie "Dutchy" Gatz, a tough no-nonsense catcher with a husband living a thousand miles away, a former major-leaguer as a father-in-law, and a pitcher who is mad at her for wanting to start someone who'd actually knock down the opposition when they crowd the plate.<br/><br/>Then <b>Dreamation 2019!</b><br/><br/><b>Jane</b>: This is a game about the network of women who provided abortion services in Chicago before Roe. I had fun with my character, a pre-law student from a traditionally radical Jewish family (the kind that dropped references to the Rosenbergs casually). The session didn't quite gel (we were testing some rules) but I'm interested in seeing where this ends up.<br/><br/><b>Orun</b>: Misha Bushyeager ran her own Afro-Futurist posthuman Space Opera. I played an insectoid physician who seemed fascinated that the deadly poison that was involved in our locked-room mystery turned out to be a great hot sauce base for his species.<br/><br/><b>Monsterhearts 2: Kingsport 1969</b>: I ran this as a two-parter. The Faery King and Queen were dueling for the Fae's loyalty; our mortal was even more co-dependent than normal; our Infernal was great at walking the tightrope; and the vampire was a hippie. It ended on the road to Woodstock. I had a lot of fun with this one <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><b>Prime Time Adventures</b>: Our show was set on a sleeper starship heading for planetfall. I played the AI user interface, who was trying to conceal the fact that she could no longer enter sleep mode, leaving her with the choice of either staying awake constantly or going into a catatonic state of unpredictable length. We had some nice work around the table, including some interplay between me and our android doctor, looking at different forms of artificial intelligence.<br/><br/><b>The Mountain Witch</b> with our own <a href="/forums/profile/Mel_White">@Mel_White</a>! I played the samurai-trained daughter of a daimyo, here to see if the Witch would be the agent of vengeance against those who killed my father. I think we all kind of got what we wanted, just not what we needed; the end was downbeat but appropriate.<br/><br/><b>Red Carnations on a Black Grave</b>: I think this was the first time I've actually played my own damn game in a while. We had a nice table, with plenty of rallying speeches, and some heartbreaking moments when the Army arrived in Paris to crush the Commune. Poor Camille <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/><b>Good Society</b> with Rachel E.S. Walton. I played the Meddler, who had a first act conversion experience and tried to use her considerable gifts to get her best friend married to the right person and rehabilitate the reputation of her former best friend. I adore this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_480972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/480972/#Comment_480972" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-04T16:58:27+00:00" title="March  4, 2019  4:58PM">March 4</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" rel="nofollow">Aviatrix</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> was that one of the Ten Candles game with Seraphina? because she brings the night.

This time the players had requested to play vampires. As in Vampire The Masquerade, \u201cfor that sweet gothic 90s vibe\u201d. Spoiler: The gothic nineties vibe never showed up.<br/><br/>I knew that there was a new edition of Vampire available but I\u2019d just cobbled together a simple generic rule system, originally for a wildly different setting, that I wanted to try. So the players would be my guinea pigs. Admittedly it is geared towards my playgroup\u2019s playstyle which leans more towards leaner rules and more storytelling but still with a GM and dice, \u201cWe want both role- and playing\u201d as one player is fond of saying. So there weren\u2019t any strong objections when I presented the Bloodsuckers RPG.<br/><br/>Beforehand we had agreed to set it in the modern day city where most of us live. I made a set of archetypes for the different clans and detailed the five people leading the vampire council (no prince here) as well as the vampire handler helping the newly fanged characters enter into the world of darkness. Session one was to be making characters and discussing how the setting worked and maybe some warming up scenes to get the ball rolling.<br/><br/>This session highlighted what I love about RPGs, you can never really predict the outcome when a bunch of people share the same creative mind space. Seen from what the players have played before I could never have guessed at the characters we ended up with: A violent Brujah greasemonkey with a selfish streak, a drug dealing street thug Giovanni, a corrupt policeman Giovanni (these Giovanni do not keep it in the family as it were) and a trailer trash Ventrue with a literal noble boyfriend providing blood and an unkown sire. <br/><br/>I wanted to sort of try out the mystery rules from Nerves of steel so we landed in the starting question of who\u2019d embraced the Ventrue.<br/><br/>The whole thing started with the newly turned vampires at graduation night at Vampire for Beginners (very reminiscient of Swedish for Immigrants, the state run school that teaches the basics of swedish language that continuously gets a bad rep for being mistargeted, unpedagogic, and just generally ill-equipped to do what it sets out to do). Thus unprepared they were sent to the council for a scare talk about keeping on the right side of appropriate and then things went out of hand, in a good way, when the Ventrue in a faux-pas asked them for clarification of who\u2019d made her.<br/><br/>We had a blast! Instead of gothic nineties we got weird gritty social commentary drama marries explosive underground violence against the backdrop of very familiar localities. Also, the rules worked very much as intended, but that might just be because I wrote them and ran them. Can\u2019t wait to play again though.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div

They had been bugging me to play for a couple of weeks (they love LEGO). I often use LEGO and LEGO topic for teaching slightly older students.  <br/><br/>They were a fairy, a good witch, and a magical cat (I homebrewed up the three new classes to suit their interests).  I had already built a five room dungeon (an abandoned knights manor) out of LEGO. They were there to rescue a princess (I know it is corny but they are all about princesses). <br/><br/>In the first room they faced a death knight. Instead of fighting him, they decided the fairy would turn him into a frog. Then she squashed him with his own halbred. A spiderweb in the corner was a monster generator spitting out spiders turn after turn. They ran from the spiders but the witch was surrounded by them. The fairy ran away through a curtain into another room smack into three zombies. She turned herself invisible then ran back. The cat and the fairy eventually decided to help the witch (after some prompting by me) after they got over their fear of (LEGO) spiders. Eventually the witch, after reading her character sheet more carefully, realized that she could talk to animals and told the spiders to run away. Then the magical cat broke the spider web, finally. Session over.<br/><br/>It was great fun for them, but the Brickquest combat sub-system is too much of a grind (for me) for a game designed to be played with LEGO with children and parents, etc. or perhaps it is really for AFOL, I don't know, but I need to re-design the combat system so it quick and easy. It needs to be more fluid or it kills the play and roleplaying.<br/><br/>They did great considering it was their first time roleplaying and they were doing it in their second language.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481087/#Comment_481087" name="Item_106" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-08T22:56:01+00:00" title="March  8, 2019 10:56PM">March 8</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing the "can I find one day this month five adults can meet" and "is it viable to volunteer to playtest Pelgrane's Borellus Connection?"

In the morning I had an excellent game of <b>Downfall</b>. Our flaw was Civility and we weren't allowed to talk about anything that bothered us! It was a fun problematic theme to explore; no one could leave relationships, you were expected to always keep the peace... it was trouble.<br/><br/>My second game was <b>Companions' Tale</b>, which I hadn't played before. It's really great and I recommend it, especially if you're looking for something with clear rules that's easy to facilitate. If you like The Quiet Year, I really encourage you to try Companions' Tale. It's going to be my go-to map game from now on.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481206/#Comment_481206" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-18T05:11:57+00:00" title="March 18, 2019  5:11AM">March 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At Dice Bubble for larps, Raptor/Falcon/Owl in So It Seems a Solstice (we remade the sky, as we were supposed to), Jelazi in Awakenings and Reconciliations (hey, guess what?

It's amazing!<br/><br/>First up was <b>Dragon and Warrior</b>, a JRPG story game. Were there battle mechanics? Yes. Did we get XP? Of course. Did we make a bunch of homages to our favorite video games? Most definitely. <br/><br/>The game follows the story of one hero, with that role plus the other narrative roles (describing allies, enemies, settings, and treasure) switching players throughout the session. It felt a bit like passing around the controller, which I loved. It does a good job of making that type of adventure/fight-y game GMless. Of course conflict doesn't need to be violent--our main conflict of the game was trying to cross the bridge. There were a lot of "look over there!" moves, which works mechanically the same as if we were doing slashy sword moves. <br/><br/>I also had a delightful game of <b>Legend of Aesthetic</b>. The game is a masterpiece of getting you to reincorporate elements from previous moments, and if I can ever get my hands on a copy of it, it is going to be one of my go-to games.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481447/#Comment_481447" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-30T06:34:22+00:00" title="March 30, 2019  6:34AM">March 30</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Monsterhearts 2 Season 2, having agreed that if the Infernal has sex with their Infernal Power, we'll handle it by each getting a string on the other.

They loved the game. And coincidentally on the train home I heard the words "short or long rest" from the next cart so I went over there and butted in and flashed my D&amp;D books and started talking D&amp;D with a group of random guys! (Seemed to be around 17yo\u2026? #justguessing) They were on their way home after playing their first session ever! I gave them some tips ("make spare characters" being one I remember\u2026 mostly they had questions and I was like "OK we've tried doing it this way, which has these pros &amp; cons, and doing it that way, which has these pros &amp; cons, so it's a tricky problem.")<br/><br/>As far as our session I finally got to try the legendary "Holy Sword" adventure from 2012. Slightly updated for a diverse audience, I changed the word "gender" to "mer". So the orc PC got turned half mer, half orc.  A mer-orc. We had a blast, six very noisy players + one unapologetic B for a DM (i.e. yours truly) so this beer&amp;pretzel type adventure was the perfect fit<br/><br/>It was also a session that made me feel vindicated in my "never fudging" attitude since some things happened coincidentally that, because they were real, were very satisfying.<br/>The party was split and one of the two trios were getting absolutely clobbered by wraiths and just when they were about to die, the other trio finally made it back to them. And one PC did die and we had two clerics. Both knew Revivify. One had the spell slot left (Neo -Vancian\u2122), the other had the diamond dust you need for the spell. Bam! What a perfectly satisfying climax to a long day of playing. They discovered just a fraction of what this wild &amp; unrule one-pager had to offer but we had a blast!

We played a 3500 AD Mars Colony scenario. The protagonist Mathieu was a hyper-potato farmer (you know, giant Mars potatoes) with muscles on his muscles, and all he really wanted in life was a medal. Meanwhile, Jacques, a horribly ugly cyborg-AI hybrid, wanted to steal Mathieu's body, and Mayor Gazdan was a secret pro-Earther plotting to destroy the Martian colony. Well, Jacques failed to steal Mathieu's body, the Mayor failed in his plot and was unmasked, and our protagonist managed to get his medal for his part in stopping the Mayor.

As usual, everything that could go wrong did, with the woodwife just barely managing to save her daughter from a vengeful ghoul, whilst at the same time the stopping her from ending the world; the changeling &amp; werewolf spun off into their own 'Games of Thrones' style series about courtly intrigue among the Fae; and the bridge troll was left stacking rocks, trying to make the worlds longest bridge.<br/><br/>Saturday evening I got to play <b>Monsterhearts 2</b> and picked the Hollow, outlining them as the Mortal's childhood imaginary friend brought to life to protect them. I decided the best way to do this was to stop the other students at school from taunting him for his Goth tendencies, so naturally I burned the entire senior year.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon was for <b>Something Is Wrong Here</b>, a Lynchian-storygame of delusion and surrealism. I described it as 'peculiar &amp; intense' and was one of the few story games I've really needed to decompress from for a long time: the presentation of the game was very evocative and supported the tones &amp; themes wonderfully.<br/><br/>Sunday evening ended with <b>Troublemakers</b>... for seven players! We picked 1950s rural England, on the south west coast, as the setting, with the Daredevil, Dog, Crush, Knuckle, Delinquent, Ranger and Mouth taking on Russian spies out to steal a British superweapon disguised as a haunted lighthouse with a guest appearance (or should that be guesht appearance?) from Sean Connery as James Bond.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chiarina" title="chiarina"><img alt="chiarina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chiarina">chiarina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481494/#Comment_481494" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-31T22:15:51+00:00" title="March 31, 2019 10:15PM">March 31</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played a german hack of <b>Poutine</b> this evening.

I enjoy reading them, short though they are.<br/><br/>This week, we continue an ongoing game of <i>My Life with Master</i>, with three fellow familiar Story Games folks (<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>, <a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a>, and <a href="/forums/profile/Demiurge%29">@Demiurge)</a>, as it approaches its final conclusion. I am the Master, and they are the Minions. It's out first time trying <i>My Life with Master</i>, so it's been quite the adventure! What an interesting game (and challenging in some ways).<br/><br/>We chose a somewhat unusual "Yukon Gold Rush" setting for our game; an icy gold mine somewhere far in the North, with miners and cowboys and prostitutes and standoffs with fast-drawn pistols, but also with a touch of weird clockwork and alchemy and Native American spirit magic. It's fairly serious and dark in tone, and two of the Minions are rather more of the powerful and intimidating variety than the typical "meek and pathetic" Minion described in the text.<br/><br/>Some people I've talked feel that going with this (instead of the default/implied Gothic Eastern Europe vibe) might be losing some of the charm or mystique of the game. We've definitely struggled with this in places - the individualism of the Western genre is somewhat at odds with the static power balance and social order implied by the game itself. However, I think we're starting to find our stride with this game.<br/><br/>It's challenging for me to really "bring the Evil" as the Master (it does not come naturally to me!). The game pretty much expects you to "deprotagonize" the PCs, and that's very much against the grain of everything I normally do in gaming. However, I find release in the Connections scenes, where we get moments of kindness, beauty, or gentleness. I imagine the final confrontation will bring further catharsis.<br/><br/>We're also experimenting with slightly more diffuse narrative authority than in a typical GMed RPG - sometimes I frame scenes pretty hard, but at other times the players get a lot of say about what happens, when, and how. In this most recent session we had a really neat scene where one character used some kind of mix mystical alchemy and Native American spirit magic to establish a connection with a young boy, whose face, once half crushed by the most terrifying Minion, was saved by turning the destroyed half into a golden mask.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/moconnor" title="moconnor"><img alt="moconnor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/483/n3W81Z19PQYI6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/moconnor">moconnor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481503/#Comment_481503" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-01T13:34:04+00:00" title="April  1, 2019  1:34PM">April 1</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran 7 sessions of Goblinville at PAX East and played in a brief one.

It took my brain a minute to switch over into the right mode, but I think the fact that I had hardly prepped anything at all was actually helpful.<br/><br/>It ended up being one of my favorite sessions, and it seemed to click for everyone at the table in a way the game never had before. At least by the end.<br/><br/>We had two Trollbabes and their adventures never intersected but unlike in previous sessions it still felt like everyone was engaged even when it wasn't their scene.<br/><br/>I think one of the most helpful changes we made to our game was how we started it. In the book it basically says that the players pick a location from the map and start the game traveling to that place on foot and eventually encounter the "stakes" of the adventure. That was alright, but this time we sat down and the players already had some ideas about what their characters wanted to do.<br/><br/>One player wanted to magically travel to realm of the elves and find the greatest bard in the universe. He told me that the elves live in a police state where they party all the time because "joy and opulence are mandatory". The other player told me she wanted to find a "mastodon trapped in amber" so she could give it as a gift to her love (a Trollbabe from a different session). The stakes ended up being about other things of course, but they were such fun ideas it really made my role a joy. I felt a lot more like a facilitator than someone "running" things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week/p2" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week">1</a><a class=" p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week/p2" rel="prev">2</a><a class="Highlight p-3" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week/p3">3</a><a class=" p-4" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week/p4" rel="next">4</a><a class=" p-5" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week/p5">5</a><a class=" p-6 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week/p6">6</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week/p4" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21906%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21906%2Fx%2Fp3%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>What did you play this week? - Page 4 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week/p4" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="What did you play this week? - Page 4" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21906/what-did-you-play-this-week/p4" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Night\xb4s Black Agents: Unto the fourth generation.

We started with crime detection. The revolutionary assassin of tsar Alexander II fled to London. Years later the russian foreign minister visits the city. In his entourage are seven members of the russian secret police (Ochrana) with the order to kill the anarchist. They are successful. Our characters are british detectives, law enforcement officials and similar figures trying to throw light on the murder. The detective is the brother-in-law of the dead. Now they detected an enclave of russian expat revolutionaries in London and a mysterious test tube with blood fell into their hands. The evidence traces back to the russian-ottoman war, maybe even further behind... but there is not much time to follow this lead - the nephew of the detective is kidnapped and the characters become more and more personally drawn into the matter (3rd session, it becomes increasingly thrilling).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge" title="Demiurge"><img alt="Demiurge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/684/n5EMN506IRUMS.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Demiurge">Demiurge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481956/#Comment_481956" name="Item_152" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-13T19:00:35+00:00" title="April 13, 2019  7:00PM">April 13</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2019 2:34AM by Demiurge.">edited April 18</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last Wednesday evening we played our Yukon Gold Rush <b>My Life with Master</b> campaign, to which Paul referred above.

It\u2019s been a really interesting and a lot of fun. The scene you created with Slim Messer - you\u2019re about to destroy the man\u2019s life and yet here you are, helping him nevertheless - was one of my favourite contributions.<br/><br/>I had a lot of trouble figuring out how Blackheart might continue to feature in the story, and whether he might have exited it altogether.<br/><br/>However, in that moment where he lifted up the revolver you\u2019d given him, pointing it at your back, he realized that you were not his real enemy - the Master, the mine, and everything it stood for was what had brought about ruin on him and his family. Yes, you had maimed his son, but there would just be another Bush Lavender if he shot you dead, for you were ultimately just a tool for Merwin Smith. <br/><br/>And then <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a> gave me a great opening for that idea by creating a psychic connection to Blackheart, at which point they influenced each other with oddly similar plans of destroying the mine (I\u2019d come up with that plan before Dave did, as we know from the vision of Blackheart stealing away from the Haida camp with a bag full of mysterious equipment). It all came together so organically... quite a joy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481967">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer" title="Hopeless_Wanderer"><img alt="Hopeless_Wanderer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hopeless_Wanderer">Hopeless_Wanderer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481967/#Comment_481967" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-14T09:02:01+00:00" title="April 14, 2019  9:02AM">April 14</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2019 9:11AM by Hopeless_Wanderer.">edited April 14</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LEGO storygaming again this week with the fairy, magic cat, and good witch. <br/><br/>After fleeing from the hallway with the three zombies, the fairy re-entered the first room where she had earlier turned the death knight into a frog. The magic cat (still there) decided to step on a golden circle that was in the floor. It was a teleport ring. She disappeared. Then the witch (also still there) and the fairy also decided to do the same because the fairy was still being followed by the zombies. They all teleported to different parts of the knight's manor (different rolls) since they didn't know how to control the ring. They hadn't spent much time looking at anything in the first room (this seems to be part of their gonzo approach to adventuring <img alt=":smile:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":smile:"/> ).<br/><br/>The cat ended up in a room with a magic door/gate on a a pedestal. It was spinning. There was a control panel. She decided to pull one of the levers. The door stop spinning and opened. She went through it, alone (very brave/foolish of her). <br/><br/>The good witch ended up in the room on the other side of the (zombie) hallway. There was a lot there to see, including a green force-field blocking an archway that she had no way to go through, but the first thing she saw was the zombies milling about in the hallway, so she hid. Unfortunately, she made some noise (partial failed roll) and the zombies started moving into the room where she was. She did find the missing princess they were looking for, though. She was in a stone-walled cell in the center of the room. The witch hid behind it. It was a pretty big room. <br/><br/>The fairy teleported to a great room with a sculpture of burning blue fire. There were also ghosts there circling the flames. They were enough for her to want to leave, immediately.  She ran to the nearest end of the room where there was a green force-field blocking the exit. Using her magical lock/unlock (it probably shouldn't have worked in this situation, but GM fiat*), she stepped through into the room with the witch, princess, and zombies. Chaos ensued.<br/><br/>The fairy used her magic to unlock the princess's cell door which opened, but that only made the princess start screaming, which attracted the zombies. The fairy turned two of the three zombies into frogs but the farthest one still remained. The princess ran into the arms of the fairy (who is human-sized, btw) with the last zombie close behind. Meanwhile, the witch was quickly making a potion to change the last zombie into a frog (they are fixated on turning things into frog, at the moment). The fairy, princess, and zombie all met in a narrow place near between the force-field and the cell, near where the witch was hiding. The witch threw her potion at the zombie (but partlly failed the roll). Unfortunately, she hit the zombie AND the princess, who both turned into frogs (interesting fairy tale reversal!). <br/><br/>[cut to the cat]<br/>The final scene was with the cat, who had teleported to a beach. She was face-to-face with a blue-skinned humanoid riding a tiger and carrying a large, transparant, pink umbrella, and a pail. There was a recently built sand castle between them. Wisely, the magical cat asked the blue-skinned humanoid for help. Blue-skin agreed, but there will be a price for helping (hook for the next adventure). [/end session]<br/><br/>*The girls were having fun. I wasn't going to quibble about whether her magic lock/unlock worked on force-fields. That would have killed the gonzo momentum they were developing.<br/><br/>We're using a <i>Yes, and; No, but</i> system for this.<br/><br/>Sorry, this was so long. I will probably start a separate thread for this AP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481969/#Comment_481969" name="Item_155" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-14T09:29:25+00:00" title="April 14, 2019  9:29AM">April 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was good frogging, and announces nice catting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481971/#Comment_481971" name="Item_156" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-14T19:04:03+00:00" title="April 14, 2019  7:04PM">April 14</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 14, 2019 7:05PM by 2097.">edited April 14</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The hin gloom stalker's wife has a magic cello that can create a cottage where they can rest. And the cello got completely submerged in red wine for somewhere between 3 and 20 minutes. And to resolve whether or not the cello still worked I called a musician friend and let him settle it. I didn't tell him the sides or the stakes, just asked whether the cello would still work. And he said he believed so, if she retuned it. And that's not hard to do, even on a fretless, it's just fifths. She keeps it at CGDA. <small>(California Guitarists Drop Acid.)</small><br/><br/>This is a fantastic game.<br/><br/>This was an "ice moon" situation, I thought it was a TPK for sure. Which I discussed openly with them.  I was like "As far as <i>I</i> know, this might very well be it. I can't think of a way out of this. New chars, or\u2026?" But since they could get their cottage they could rest and get new spells. By a weird combination of spells including\u2026 guidance\u203d!? and bardic inspiration\u2026?! they managed to get out of their conundrum. It was a real drakar&amp;bananer challenge, except legit, &amp; with mechanics. "Physics" (except the weird-ass physics of spells and magic cellos).<br/><br/>It was a great session of tangibility, of doing math on liquid volumes, on reading up discussions of spell effects on Stack Exchange, and of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Also we ruled that lesser restoration spell can sober up your lantern ghost if she gets too drunk but is not enough to de-goatify your enby hin evoker jester if they get goatified.<br/><br/>I felt really vindicated in this DM style. This is exactly the sort of game I really really value the most. "Mirror story" style.<br/><br/>Also in the session they were fighting a monster and I thought it was so obvi that they'd win that I at first was like "OK, you can split 700 xp" and they were like "ok, yeah, we can just defeat it\u2026?" which sometimes we do when they are kiting or w/e and the pretty monster can't really do anything. But we talked it out and decided that OK we'll have to roll it out. It is actually a dangerous and non-obvious, even if likely, victory. And the gloom stalker did almost die. In the end they didn't really expend resources, but they <i>risked</i> dying. Also, rolling out the fight was FAST. The new fighting system feels fast to me. Not the world's biggest fight \u2014 the boys (a hin gloom stalker and a moon dwarve) vs a CR 3 creature while the other two hin kept the fort under control in the magical cello cottage. But it was made more complicated because they had to hold their breath.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481972">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481972/#Comment_481972" name="Item_157" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-14T21:41:14+00:00" title="April 14, 2019  9:41PM">April 14</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                             What about the new fighting system makes it faster?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davey" title="davey"><img alt="davey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/739/n2UJ50N52BV5N.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davey">davey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481975/#Comment_481975" name="Item_158" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-15T01:01:40+00:00" title="April 15, 2019  1:01AM">April 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Untold: adventures await. <br/>I haven\u2019t been frequenting this site for a while.

I\u2019m sorry. Real life and stuff. In any case, I played a game again, it was with kids again. BUT it was not in class and I was not a GM. I wasn\u2019t even aware we\u2019d be roleplaying as the kid in question just invented a game on the spot, in a train. <br/><br/>He drew a labyrinth (and I wasn\u2019t allowed to watch) which I had to solve. First time around, that was all, second time around he included dragons, doors that could only be opened by solving a riddle (mostly, \u201cwhat number am I thinking about\u201d between a range of numbers, different every time, but also like questions where I had to guess things about him choosing from two options). When a riddle was solved I\u2019d get bonus points that could be exchanged for \u201cpowers\u201d.<br/><br/>I encountered one of the dragons and used my LASER POWER on it, which he ruled distracted it and made it run away (like a freaking cat with a laser pointer) ruling that when I would meet it again, it would have found something and made it be a MEGA DRAGON.<br/><br/>We didn\u2019t manage to finish it, but it was very fun.<br/><br/>This kid is seven years old.

We had a new player join which great, and they all decided to go back to the <i>Tomb of the Serpent Kings</i> which I was even more excited about (I like that module)! At one point they broke into a tomb and nearly died from a lightning trap only to find the stone coffin inside was totally empty. "Well that was anti climactic", was the general consensus. Previously I would have probably added something to the coffin on the spot but I'm trying to just let things ride and see what happens. That said pretty much <i>none</i> of the coffins have treasure in them in this module?? I might have tweaked that if I had read the whole thing more carefully, feels weird to me. Anyway empty coffins aside I think everyone had a pretty good time.<br/><br/>The night before I also played some Trollbabe, but it didn't feel as smooth as the last session we had. One player keeps coming up with "acquire this item from this exotic location" as a goal for his character, and I just can't seem to find much complexity or excitement in that. He's actually bringing a lot of cool ideas to the game so I feel bad that I can't meet him with any interesting stakes... At least I have a better idea of the kind of stuff he's interested in now, maybe it will make it easier to brainstorm some options.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482202/#Comment_482202" name="Item_169" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-21T00:52:28+00:00" title="April 21, 2019 12:52AM">April 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/ebear">@ebear</a>, I don't know the exact details or circumstances, but my instinct say that if a player gives me "acquire this item from this exotic location", I need to wrap some relationship complexity around it.

Probably would require more context (like a threads worth) to dissect if I could be doing more there, but I think it would be more efficient to just try and talk to him about it first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_482285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482285/#Comment_482285" name="Item_173" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T05:21:22+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  5:21AM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<small>(Agree 100% about the walnuts Ebear)</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482328/#Comment_482328" name="Item_174" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-22T19:52:59+00:00" title="April 22, 2019  7:52PM">April 22</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My 14-year-old students loved Diadem!

Shower mortal with praise, commend their common sense, buy them several drinks, maybe give them money. It was the Wizard who, after someone tossed around the term "magic", decided to explain that magic was code for *shows gun*. At which point, Tainted just handed mortal money for "hazard pay", but hey, still not a problem.<br/><br/>Only now the Oracle felt guilty, so the Wizard decided to suggest just wiping their friend's mind of the last hour.

A few lessons learned:<br/>1. PbtA games really really starts to shine over multiple sessions!<br/>2. Actively coming up with hooks and options to do for PCs every session (influence: 13th Ages) initially sounded as an interesting idea but its a heavy burden for me as an MC and established a bad attitude where players mostly react to my prep and do less proactive stuff!<br/>3. In 'trad' games where I have to prep I often fall into a trap by madly trying to 'serve others taste' which turns prep into a chore or work. I know that the solution is evident to a lot of people but I really had to force myself to put things which I am interested in into my game <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> The ideas all came up on the bus to the cafe where we play and throwing them into the game was risky but I think it brought some fresh air and momentum!<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/>1. Trying to strangle a PC on a romantic lake floating by her assassin lover. It was soo epic!<br/>2. A honorable PC surprisedel me by opting out from a weird looking assassination attempt and by that she learned that it was a trap! Now she has the upper hand in her organization!<br/>3. The only male PCs weakness made him fck up the most important spiritual transcending attempt in the setting but he also learned that there might be also some kind of conspiracy avtively sabotaging it so it is not (just) his fault.<br/><br/>We also tried out <b>The Lodger</b>, a horror party RPG. We rolled well and managed to wipe out the sinister Lodger in 3 days (45 minutes) which turned the original creepiness into a 'it looks like a horror movie but actually its just a rotting cat corpse between walls' type of hipster meta-horror movie <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/>Although I still liked it but using the optional daily drama rules is highly recommended!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_482642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/482642/#Comment_482642" name="Item_184" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-27T17:18:45+00:00" title="April 27, 2019  5:18PM">April 27</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2019 5:18PM by Paul_T.">edited April 27</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds interesting!

It's not a long game but we are playing during lunch break, so three short sessions.  It's a fun game, even though we are bad at drawing. With two players, and only ten turns each, we have started a lot of arcs that won't see their apices. The game probably works best with four or more players (as many as seven or eight). <br/><br/>We are using the map we create for the start of our upcoming Archipelago game/campaign. One neat thing about ATYUTS is that it generates NPCs as well as a map and a history. If you use all the arcs that's more that 50 NPCs, of which many will be part of the setting history. We haven't done the best job keeping track of them all. Some have been lost to history.<br/><br/>Our map contains a tribe of crocodile-hunters, some bear-worshipping neandertals, some Amazons, some chariot-barbarians (wiped out by the Amazons), a splinter group of dark-worshipping Amazonian cultists, a Tolkien-esque wizard in a dark tower, a sea god, and an Empire of Light (which is off the map edge).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chiarina" title="chiarina"><img alt="chiarina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chiarina">chiarina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483199/#Comment_483199" name="Item_195" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-11T17:56:55+00:00" title="May 11, 2019  5:56PM">May 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Night\xb4s Black Agents: Unto the fourth generation.

We used real-life actors and celebrities for all of the main characters! It's hilarious to play, but I'm not sure how savoury it is to write about here. I know, I'll try to protect the famous people's identities!<br/><br/>The story so far: a certain ex-vice president was inducted into the cannibal conspiracy so they could use his <i>algorithm</i> (see if you can use this pun to figure out his identity, <i>groan</i>) to help spread a plague and discredit a rival billionaire inventor. Simultaneously, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breitbart_News" rel="nofollow">Breitbart</a> broadcast propaganda on a manufactured <i>Elongate</i> scandal regarding this inventor (can you guess who the inventor is yet? Hint: it's another name pun). We've had at least 2 or 3 people get eaten alive by billionaire cannibals so far. The billionaires file their teeth to points to make it easier to eat raw flesh, and wear fake teeth on top (like reverse Halloween vampires). Finally, our 3rd main character (you may know her as the neuroscientist from The Big Bang Theory, and yet she is also a neuroscientist in real life!) was fighting to stop the plague and got gunned down in a clever cannibal contrivance. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/>  Who will save humanity from the plague now?<br/><br/>In other news, we're still trying to organize our next game of <b>My Life With Master</b>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483268/#Comment_483268" name="Item_197" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-12T20:29:17+00:00" title="May 12, 2019  8:29PM">May 12</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.

Unfortunately eating &amp; washing up ate into a bit of our playing time &amp; I feel bad af about that.</p><p>Then we had decided to do a \u201cdream fight\u201d to teach the new fighting rules, going over them carefully &amp; then playing out a fight \u201cin dreams\u201d. Sorted out snafus and made changes based on the text. Even after so many things that were awkward &amp; wrong the players were STOKED!!</p><p>Then in the actual game, wow\u2026 one of the best \u201cHillfolk\u201d scenes we\u2019ve had ever; the Gloom Stalker is cursed so that he magically can only speak the truth. It\u2019s been that way for eleven sessions (four days diegetically \u2014 yes they really conserve lamp oil and food now so they eke out every minute). So today the party finally deduced that the Gloom Stalker had this curse. So War Cleric asks \u201cDo you think I\u2019m hot?\u201d The Gloom Stalker is married to Lore Bard (their characters are! not a couple IRL). Gloom Stalker says \u201cI\u2019d rather not answer that question.\u201d Lore Bard says telepathically to her husband \u201cGo on, honey. I\u2019m sure we\u2019d all want to know!\u201d and Gloom Stalker finally after long awkward silence says <small>\u201cyes\u201d</small>. Most well-earned drama token of all time!</p><p>Then there was some puzzle solving; didn\u2019t finish the puzzle but they found an ingenious way to get a great clue.</p><p><strong>Content warning: violence!</strong></p><p>Then there was a fight vs a quartet of four-armed-gargoyles with the new system which was\u2026. OH WOW!! we made some minor mistakes, much fewer than I hought, but <em>wow</em>!!!! The spending hitpoints thing that <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> came up with worked great!</p><p>Fighter: I\u2019m rolling away from the garg!<br/>DM: OK, make four defense rolls DC 18!"<br/>Fighter: I made three of them!<br/>DM: Three of his arms go KLONK KLONK KLONK into the stone behind you as you roll away but the fourth one reaches over you towards your face, <em>what do you do?</em><br/>Fighter: I roll laterally, to the side!<br/>DM: Ok, you can spend 9 hitpoints to do that!</p><p>That was kinda the flow we fell into!</p><p>When you couldn\u2019t spend, that\u2019s when you got hurt!</p><p>Our war cleric narrated sweeping two arms aside with her shield and the other two aside with her morning star. She succeeded on two defense rolls\u2014the shield block was effective, but the two arms on the morning star side could reach around the star easily; what do you do? She said she tried to step over to the shield side some more, away from the arms</p><p>\u201cOK, you can spend 18 hp to do that\u201d<br/>\u201cI don\u2019t have that!\u201d<br/>\u201cThen roll an injury!\u201d<br/>\u201c9\u201d<br/>\u201cCrush as the arms break your ribs!\u201d<br/>\u201cUh, btw, I\u2019m also down!\u201d</p><p>(don\u2019t worry she later got healing-worded, healing the ribs&amp;bringing her back into the fight.)</p><p>So we have 5 players + DM (six chars; the lore bard is a second character of one of the players).</p><p>Three of the players stoked af, including the two usually most hard-to-please ones. They were standing up and cheering!!! People were leaving their chairs larping around like animals!!!</p><p>The fourth player not really into the fact that fights (the boringest part for this player) now take MUCH more time.</p><p>The fifth player really supportive but also concerned that they were being cheated out of actions turn-order-wise. They weren\u2019t &amp; I have docs &amp; action tracker to prove that, but I think this is a player that needs to grok the rules to feel comfortable &amp; have buy-in. And I hope &amp; think that\u2019s possible.</p><p>Don\u2019t continue the discussion in this thread (as per directed for \u201cWhat did you play this week\u201d thread)</p><ul><li><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22060/d-d-2097e-remapping-diegesis-mimesis-and-all-kinds-of-sis#latest" rel="nofollow">Questions/comments about HP spend go here</a></li><li><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22067/d-d5e-without-the-action-economy#latest" rel="nofollow">Question/comments about turn order chaos go here</a></li><li><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/22033/what-if-mechanics-were-subordinate-to-game-play-as-opposed-to-directive#latest" rel="nofollow">If this brings to mind Sil\u2019s style, the currently open thread for that is here</a></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_483416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/textman" title="textman (Banned)"><img alt="textman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/textman">textman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483416/#Comment_483416" name="Item_206" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T07:30:03+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  7:30AM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 15, 2019 7:33PM by textman.">edited May 15</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_483428">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483428/#Comment_483428" name="Item_207" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-15T09:22:10+00:00" title="May 15, 2019  9:22AM">May 15</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't play that with kids. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483595/#Comment_483595" name="Item_208" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-17T07:05:14+00:00" title="May 17, 2019  7:05AM">May 17</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dracula Dossier, "Slayer Elite", part 1 of 3.<br/><br/>Quotes include:<br/><br/>Smiley: Do you even know any British people?<br/>Red: Are you kidding?

Bush promised that he would stop "the Boss" for once and for all. One of the other victims identified Bush as the arsonist, and Bush left the building, filled with steely determination.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there was a major drama between Darren the alchemical golem and Blackheart, one of the townspeople whose family had been banished from town. Blackheart had been trying to blow up the mine (the one providing the town with gold), but Darren disarmed him (almost literally). The Master arrived and ordered Darren to bring Blackheart back to the Master's demesne. Darren was forced to comply, but he secretly left a lit torch next to the explosives that Blackheart had set up!<br/><br/>Our third PC, Galilee the fearful child, was being led to the Master's demesne after having been AWOL for a long time. <br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the next session, as I have a surprise in store...<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_483678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/483678/#Comment_483678" name="Item_210" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-18T18:29:09+00:00" title="May 18, 2019  6:29PM">May 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also glad the game is back on, and moving towards its inevitable conclusion. It's been fun to try to play such a heavily GM-led game while leaving a lot of space for the players to introduce material and set scenes, and it's felt really good to me when that balance has been well received. I'm really enjoying how you and Dave are using those opportunities to add stuff to the fiction and develop characters and storylines. <br/><br/>Looking forward to your "surprise"! Bush has a moment of freedom, both in terms of the character's situation and in terms of your ability as a player to dictate what we might focus on next, so I encourage you to take advantage of that. He's made a number of enemies in Treadwell who are likely to come looking for him or to get in his way (like Rorik, Gil, and Cobb, as well as Luce), and Clementine is still in the Master's demesne, awaiting whatever purpose he needs her for.

The player loved the first because it is more useful than harmful -- but when making an impassioned speech calling people on their shit and using Freak to bump the result up to a 10, well, that removed that condition, at least for now. This rather nicely sums up her central conflict, I think.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Witch's father's dealing with the Serpentine's aunt for power. He's been jealous of his son for quite some time, but hey, now he has power too! The Witch's girlfriend and mentor is ill, and no one involved in worrying about that is yet certain whether this is natural or not. Meanwhile, no one knows what the Infernal's done and are more worried about the Dark Power doing things that, well, he isn't doing.<br/><br/>Arguably, he's got a string on the Witch who asked him to get the Infernal to comfort her crying sister, as the Witch didn't want to deal with that himself, but neither was he willing to leave the sister alone with the Dark Power.<br/><br/>All of this took place during a day of mock trial by combat because the Infernal, who used to be the Werewolf, doesn't understand why things aren't just settled with fighting and strength, and this debate in history class turned into a School Event. No actual fighting, just competitions from debates to track races to poetry writing -- and bribing the judges is explicitly allowed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs" title="Caroline_Hobbs"><img alt="Caroline_Hobbs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/121/nILD1Q33E03N4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caroline_Hobbs">Caroline_Hobbs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484143/#Comment_484143" name="Item_223" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-24T17:40:21+00:00" title="May 24, 2019  5:40PM">May 24</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A bounty of gaming washed over my home this week!<br/><br/>I did an inaugural playtest of an unnamed game about ecological crisis that I'm working on.

One of the absent players\u2019 character has a Greater <abbr title="Restoration">Resto</abbr> though which can unpetrify peeps so we just need to wait for her. Tuesday probably.</p><p>Arguably being level drained is worse than dying because if you die you can roll up a new PC. Otoh story wise ofc dying is worse. This was a very invested PC tangled up into our soap opera stuff so it\u2019s a big loss.</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> It\u2019s also an anecdatapoint on the following issue.</p><p>Some well-known bloggers, Sly Flourish and Mike Krahulik, have reported that \u201cIt\u2019s hard to challenge the players\u201d.</p><p>I get that it can seem that way for the DM when weeks go buy without anyone dying. But I\u2019ve tried to remain calm (this is our first time spending this much time at this high a level; we\u2019ve only done shorter stuff at this level before). Because <em>when</em> a PC dies, that\u2019s gonna sting. That\u2019s gonna have a <em>lot</em> of impact. I\u2019m OK with that not happening. My philosophy being \u201cthey die anyway\u201d and the feeling that D&amp;D is kinda self-balancing just like a good JRPG [like Gaudia Quest] is; not by any sort of adfudgement or scaling by me as DM but just by the basic nature of you steamrolling your way forward if you\u2019re over-leveled and you slowing down af when you\u2019re under-leveled. Such and such being OP? \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Sandra,\u201d I\u2019d tell myself. \u201cThey die anyway\u201d. And today that came to pass for the first time in two weeks diegetically, 26 sessions extradiegetically (and 168 days extradiegetically \u2013 almost half a year without any PC deaths!). A couple of henches has died though.</p><p>I think it\u2019s a <i>good</i> thing that they don\u2019t die so often. In our side campaign at lower levels there has been plenty of deaths though.</p> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_484259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/484259/#Comment_484259" name="Item_227" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-05-25T20:22:39+00:00" title="May 25, 2019  8:22PM">May 25</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's fantastic!

We had two absent players tonight so it's not a literal *total* party kill, but everyone who was present got gone.<br/><br/>You folx remember the "mirror story" right? <i>[Yes, Sandra, you talk about it all the time]</i><br/><br/>This was a different module but a very similar magic mirror. I didn't put it in there and I didn't know of it when I selected the module [I <i>had</i> read ahead so I knew it was there]. And instead of them taking the mirror or whatever, here is what happened.<br/><br/>As soon as they got in the room with the mirror, I let them know that it's there. I <i>don't</i> presuppose that any of them are looking in it. I say that they see the reflection of their own torch light. Alice says: "I'm looking away! I always avert my eyes when I see mirrors in dungeons".<br/><br/>Bob (who is holding the torch) says "I look in the mirror, what do I see?"<br/><br/>I hand him a note that he reads. He rolls a die and shakes his head. Alice and Carol have no idea what's on the note and what's in the mirror.<br/><br/>I say "Alice, Carol, suddenly you're standing in the dark"<br/><br/>They're like "Was the torch snuffed out, or?"<br/><br/>I say "One moment you saw it, both in the room and a glint of it reflected, but now you're standing in the dark."<br/><br/>"Are we in the same room, or were we teleported, or what?"<br/><br/>"You don't know."<br/><br/>They fish out a new torch and tinderbox it up. Alice doesn't have a tinderbox, but Carol does.<br/><br/>Carol says "I look in the mirror".<br/><br/>I hand her the note that Bob had read. She rolls a die and says no.<br/><br/>I say to Alice "It went dark again. You're alone"<br/><br/>Followed confused larping and feeling their way around the pitch black room. Way too many "wait wait I'm confused let's start over, *where* are you exactly?" Uh... working your way in a dark room is hard you guys!<br/><br/>And then she says "OK I have sussed out where the mirror is, right? It's dark. I look into it."<br/><br/>I hand her the mysterious note.<br/><br/>It says...<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>..."Make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw."<br/><br/>Then we spend the rest of the night rolling up new chars.<br/><br/><a href="http://users.rider.edu/~suler/zenstory/silence.html" rel="nofollow">Four monks decided to meditate silently without speaking for two weeks.</a> By nightfall on the first day, the candle began to flicker and then went out.

Except the Witch (Battler) had hexed the Infernal (formerly the Werewolf) (Margot) so she can't harm anyone including herself, so she was angry at him and threw a bunch of ineffective punches at him saying what he'd did while he tried to weasle (you know, "I don't know what you're talking about" when it's bleeping obvious she knows what he did -- which both players agree is the case, you understand).<br/><br/>The Serpentine (formerly the Queen) (Viridian) who removed her Condition Fallen Queen, but still has Weird and Nerd is finding these a benefit in her competition with the Ghost (Chris) over the same girl. But she's also trying to be a grown up and call the Infernal on her shit, so she said, "So, you know how Battler is always trying to solve problems with magic, and that's wrong? Well, you always try to solve them with violence, and that's also wrong."<br/><br/>And the Infernal broke down in tears.<br/><br/>Witch (having trouble parsing this): Margot? ...

It\u2019s him, the woman he loves, and the man <i>she</i> loves.<br/><br/>No one leaves the room until someone loses a hand, says the Master. \u201cIt\u2019s up to you who it is, Bush.\u201d<br/><br/>He wheels in a table with a two-foot long bonesaw.<br/><br/>Without hesitation, Bush starts to slice off his left hand.

The Wizards' Council is currently controlled by an evil faction and is doing evil, but we may be about to stop them. The mayor jumped into the tiger exhibit at the zoo and lost a hand to the tigers, but we managed to save her, though not stop medics from taking her to... some hospital somewhere. Someone's pulling her strings, as she's been ranting about the supernatural and stepped down in favor of... someone (she didn't name the person before diving into the tiger exhibit). And someone must have done something to make her seem particularly tasty to the tigers. And there may be a Fae war. And the Vampires and Werewolves are pretty much already at war.<br/><br/>So yeah, just a regular Monday in the city.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486354">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486354/#Comment_486354" name="Item_252" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-18T03:13:43+00:00" title="June 18, 2019  3:13AM">June 18</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tonight, we wrapped a pretty long-playing game/campaign of My Life with Master.<br/><br/>It's been mentioned before in this thread: a sprawling sort of mini-epic set in Gold Rush-era Yukon, cold rushing river, gold mine, Native magic, and alchemy.<br/><br/>It was beautiful and tragic.<br/><br/>If you're a sensitive soul, I'd advice you not to read too much further: there was some gruesome business in between the moments of beauty and heart.<br/><br/>Details here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22155/we-finally-play-my-life-with-master-after-game-report" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/22155/we-finally-play-my-life-with-master-after-game-report</a><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486402">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486402/#Comment_486402" name="Item_253" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-18T19:36:52+00:00" title="June 18, 2019  7:36PM">June 18</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 18, 2019 7:37PM by NickWedig.">edited June 18</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This weekend was Origins, so I played a lot of RPGs in the Games on Demand room and a few things outside GoD. <br/><br/>I playtested <i><b>Rusa\u0142ka</b></i> my tragic game of fairy tale water spirits, several times. Each time it makes a sad little series of stories that interlink in surprising ways. No one in this game ever gets what they want, and that is beautiful. Except for one game I played one-on-one with a friendly rabbi just as the Sabbath was ending. In that game, there were a surprising number of happy endings. I wonder why that game turned out differently.<br/><br/>I also played <i><b>Psi*Run</b></i>, which was fun and engaging. One player had a habit of blurting out excellent answers to people's questions well before the dice said we were supposed to answer those questions. And I made a few bad calls as GM, but not enough to ruin anyone's enjoyment (as far as I can tell). In the end, one PC turned out to be a former member of the Chasers, and when another PC used mass hypnosis to pull the Chasers into a deadly trap, the former Chaser got hypnotized as well. So he wound up dying in the big final sequence, along with most of the antagonist NPCs.<br/><br/>I got to play <a href="http://www.jwalton.media/#/restless/" rel="nofollow">Jonathan Walton's game <i><b>Restless</b></i></a> after wanting to for years. even though I dislike zombie stories and post-apocalyptic stories, I found this game very interesting and engaging for the ways that it structures the story and gameplay. Plus, more tragic deaths, including two instances of a player character accidentally shooting and killing another PC. (I think the only people or things that were shot the entire session were other PCs by tragic mistake).<br/><br/>And finally, I played a game of <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/273947/Scouts-of-the-Wyrdwood-Forest--Playtest-Preview" rel="nofollow"><i><b>Scouts of the Wyrdwood Forest</b></i></a> with my children. It's a fun kids' adventure game, focused on teamwork and problem solving through nonviolent means. So that's pretty cool. And especially cool is that you have adults play talking animal sidekicks that give advice and help to the scouts played by child players. That's a smart way to set up the game so that adults and kids can play together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachlan" title="lachlan"><img alt="lachlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachlan">lachlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486430/#Comment_486430" name="Item_254" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-19T17:54:20+00:00" title="June 19, 2019  5:54PM">June 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One-shot of <i>Night Witches</i>, with one player who'd been my <i>Good Society</i> game, one player who had <i>Dungeon World </i>experience, and one player who was brand new. <br/><br/>-\tI burned through a *lot* of plot, mostly because I was nervous and wound up rushing the resolution of day scenes.

It flowed surprisingly well.  Mostly new players, but impressive buy in to the concept and systems.  The spotlight-sharing was more or less seamless.  We adjusted the timeline of the game a bit (having to camp every two turns instead of four, etc) but this might not have even been necessary.  The biggest difference was that they could take on bigger threats than the best-equipped four goblin crew.<br/><br/>The moment to moment drama was consistently fun: diving off waterfalls, talking to confused ghosts, grumbling about haughty elves.  Again, the player buy-in drove this more than any moves on my part.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486445/#Comment_486445" name="Item_256" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-19T21:34:28+00:00" title="June 19, 2019  9:34PM">June 19</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran Dogs in the Vineyard last night, and a really interesting thing I'd never seen before happened. I'm running it for a group of rather OSR-oriented gamers, who've never played Dogs before.<br/><br/>In short:<br/><br/>1. One of the players took Traits that allow him to do subtle things which might appear vaguely demonic (like change the colour of his eyes).<br/><br/>2. In the initiations, I told them to include an NPC of the Town, if they wanted. (I had listed all the major NPCs in the Town on a piece of paper for them to consider for Relationships.)<br/><br/>3. For his initiation, this player wanted a scene with the Steward, where he convinced the Steward that he knew a lot about occult things and demonology.<br/><br/>4. Finally, we come to play the Town itself, and this Dog plays some tricks and launches a conflict to convince the Steward the <b>he (the Steward) is possessed by Demons</b>!<br/><br/>Pretty wild. Obviously, it worked, too, and it was in full public view, so now everyone in the Town (and the Steward himself) think their Steward is under demonic possession. The Dog is announcing recent marriages the Steward performed as invalid, and so on!<br/><br/>It's double interesting because of the Town prep I'd done for the Steward. I don't know if the players might read this, so I'd better leave this out, but it's incredible coincidence with what I had prepped: the way the Steward is going to interpret this possession in relation to his behaviour is going to be <i>super interesting</i>, and feels inevitable.<br/><br/>I'm now very excited to get back to this Town (we had to stop halfway through.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486452">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486452/#Comment_486452" name="Item_257" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-20T05:55:11+00:00" title="June 20, 2019  5:55AM">June 20</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2019 5:55AM by Lisa Padol.">edited June 20</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just ran part 2 of "The Slayer Elite", NBA scenario in The Edom Files set in 1980.

Though to be fair, we may want to split the money six ways anyway.<br/><br/>There was also some discussion about their mission, given that the PCs were not Agents per se but rather assorted criminal or otherwise wanted people.<br/><br/>Smiley: I'm a thief, not an assassin!<br/>Red: I'm a bomber. I'm little bit of both.<br/><br/>And later:<br/><br/>Smiley: I'm a con artist, not a cold blooded murderer.<br/>Red: I'm a happy go lucky murderer.

Like, yes, I worked out the answers to a couple of questions that no longer matter, but that was stuff that might have mattered, and yes, I'm playing with convoluted R-maps, but that's for when we get to the present(ish) day, if we do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chiarina" title="chiarina"><img alt="chiarina" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chiarina">chiarina</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486484/#Comment_486484" name="Item_262" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T10:37:42+00:00" title="June 21, 2019 10:37AM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Allright... maybe this is the best possibility to play this adventure in a campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486491">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486491/#Comment_486491" name="Item_263" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-21T15:22:02+00:00" title="June 21, 2019  3:22PM">June 21</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's probably fine for a convention run so long as you frame aggressively and keep everyone focused on the missions.

The Author's player was sick so the Nurse PC and my Cellist PC went on adventures alone.<br/><br/>The session started with the Nurse's prospective boyfriend showing up on the doorstep, with a horrible story about firefighters with axes cutting down one of his friends. And arson.<br/><br/>The PCs put him to bed to recover and left to investigate.  Found the fire station at the end of a desolate road deep in the woods.  It was patrolled by two firefighters in full kit, with chains and axes.  Sensing that something was wrong we escaped, and instead went and had coffee with the senile witch to learn more about the monsters that hide in the woods, and about <i>the marsh walk-ritual</i>.<br/><br/>We ended the session with the PCs performing the ritual late at night in the woods where they encountered a magical creature, somewhat woman-like with red braids.  They slept with her in exchange for magical items.<br/><br/>So now we have a necklace made of teeth and a small blue cow with silver bells on its horns.  Exactly what these items do is still unknown, research is ongoing.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_486560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ebear" title="ebear"><img alt="ebear" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ebear">ebear</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486560/#Comment_486560" name="Item_265" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-23T18:53:03+00:00" title="June 23, 2019  6:53PM">June 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been playing a lot of Monster of the Week lately, but this week I got to try The Wizards Grimoire and Psi*Run. They were both new to me and both ended up being a really great time.<br/><br/>I played The Wizards Grimoire with two friends who play with pretty regularly, but always as GM. So they wanted me to play the Wizard to change things up. I really dug the way the game changed up the typical GM-player structure, and I could totally imagine hacking other games to run that way. For the volunteers it was their first time in a GM type role and they really took to it (although they had to tell me to pipe down a few times at the beginning)! I think it helps that they have great chemistry together as players. The only snag was that they were a bit worried about blocking me at some points since I was the only player, and it can be a little tricky finding a mixed success in the exertion mechanics. I particularly love the list of spawning circumstances and I picked "Tell your volunteers that you've been seeking out an astrologer-hermit to help you unravel certain confusions you suffer, in the wilderness outside the city. You've been unable to find them. Now night is hard upon you, you've been cornered by a raiding party of the city's enemies." What an exciting way to start the game!<br/><br/>IPsi*Run I  GM'd as a one shot at our local RPG Meetup and that was possibly even more fun. First of all the premise about having super powers but no memories and being on the run from a mysterious organization is just so perfect for a one shot. How could that not be exciting? The best part of the game for me though was definitely the questions that the players created at the beginning of the game and the fact that I as the GM played almost no role in answering them. It allowed for a twist ending that I had no idea was coming; I don't think that's ever really happened for me in a game where I was the GM before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_486563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/486563/#Comment_486563" name="Item_266" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-06-23T20:55:17+00:00" title="June 23, 2019  8:55PM">June 23</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That\u2019s a great write up, <a href="/forums/profile/ebear">@ebear</a>!
