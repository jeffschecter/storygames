As in, "so dead, even thread originators don't come back to read replies."<br/><br/>Perhaps--especially with The Forge getting winterized--Praxis should be folded back into Story Games? Benefits include one log in, more eyes on new ideas, a centralized archive (i.e., for search). I can think of no downsides--we already have "design threads" cropping up in here; and one can ignore design threads as readily as D&amp;D or jeepform threads (i.e., scan on by, nothing to see here). It might be a bit of a bitch to pull in the existing posts, or it might be trivial (I don't know, with Vanilla).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379240">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King" title="Double King"><img alt="Double King" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Double%20King">Double King</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379240/#Comment_379240" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T07:41:13+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  7:41AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            +1                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379252/#Comment_379252" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T08:52:30+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  8:52AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like this idea assumes that Story-Games wants those sorts of discussions to have a home where they'll be supported.

They basically encourage people to start easy-to-digest posts which attract a lot of attention from people who want to be helpful, but then leave the helpful people in the lurch when the OP almost inevitably doesn't follow up. This causes the helpful people to burn out. I'm not yet completely convinced that forums are unworkable as a basis for a game design community, but the ways that have been tried haven't been super effective. Even if there was a good way to do a game design forum (which might be an interesting discussion topic), I'm skeptical that the S-G forum culture, with all the snarkiness, etc., would be a good match.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379293/#Comment_379293" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T13:12:01+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  1:12PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys should talk about how to engineer a good game design forum.

Got new people. Kept its focus on gameplay and games. And of course, since it was kind of an offshoot from an earlier Forge, there was some design talk here and there (mostly people finishing up some work or other and saying "Here's some files, if you're interested give it a shot!"<br/><br/>After a few years, there was suddenly an influx of "designers". People whose "Join" message wasn't so much "Hey I like (game X) and want to talk about it", but rather pretty much 75% of the Join messages for 2-3 months were "I'm working on a game design and I want some feedback".<br/><br/>The threads about gaming simply choked the main page. There was a point where over half the threads on the top page were basically people posting the same game design shit they do on Livejournal or other personal blog, but just here in front of other people. And not even a lot of "Hey can someone help me on this specific thing?" (which has always been inobtrusive), it was more "Here's another post where I talk about my aim for this game I'm working on: (INSERT WEB LINK)." Basically, not looking for feedback but looking for lots of attention. Or perhaps using the forum to talk about the design they eventually want to get around to starting instead of actually Starting it ("Resistance"). <br/><br/>And many of these Designers weren't participating at all in the forum in threads about gameplay or whatever, they were simply posting a public blog-like-thing. It became parasitic, which... "meh"... but on top of that it was drowning out the real game and play discussion which was always the heart of this place. This place started to look like RPGNet Tangency. Or worse, the RPGNet game design forum. (zing!)<br/><br/>Since this forum doesn't have a mode for splitting out groups of categories into sub-pages (Note: Vanilla 2.0 does!) in the same database, letting the discussion continue here wasn't a viable option. <br/><br/>For about a full year after Jason and I diagnosed the problem, the solution was "Go to the Forge or somewhere else." <br/>The response was, "But I like the people here!"<br/>To which my reply was "...so? Again, take it somewhere else."<br/><br/>But after a while, I got many, many pleas in whispers and emails to allow game design to be discussed here, and from people who were pretty active in the actual gameplay/gaming threads. Many of them just didn't like the atmosphere or environment at the Forge, or had a series of unfortunate interactions which led them to avoid the place. <br/><br/>Since I could split the DB and create a totally unmoderated zero-work zero-upkeep area for design discussion, I did so. Basically stating from the beginning that it was no longer my responsibility to keep it active or alive, it was up to the people who wanted to do the design discussion. It sort of went that way in the beginning, but over time it gradually died. Part of that was because of other, better places to discuss design (G+). Part of it was that as the Forge closed down various sub-forums, it started a mini-renaissance there again of more activity. <br/><br/>So, in the current form of S-G, we won't see bottom-up game design threads here. If you want to post a playtest, this is the place. If you need help with a very specific thing ("Hey, anyone know good books on Mesopotamian culture? I need some reference materials." "Hey, this rule doesn't work, can anyone suggest an alternate?" etc) I've allowed it to happen here. But we're not sliding back to the days of a hundred people all talking past each other in design threads created here because they couldn't get enough eyes on their blog.<br/><br/>(cont)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379383/#Comment_379383" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T19:49:00+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  7:49PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2012 7:49PM by Andy.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, having said that, we're not too far away from an upgrade to Vanilla 2.0. When that happens, I've been thinking about creating a game design space again, since Vanilla in 2.0 can actually be split into sub-forums: The game play/talk of S-G proper categories in one area, and the game design and publishing categories in another. One database. More inter-connected. But still, not all meshed together with Design and Play threads in one place.<br/><br/>However, please see this bit from Jason:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>You guys should talk about how to engineer a good game design forum. That is a worthy goal.</blockquote>\nSo, very recently, the "mod staff" (got to think of a better word) were inspired by John Stavropolous' simple but elegant idea:<br/>* We have specific goals for Story Games. Success conditions. People we want to "play" here. Behaviors we want to encourage, and behaviors we want to discourage. <br/>So why don't we look at the forums as if they were a game that we are in the process of perpetually designing?<br/><br/>BOOM: Off we went. A lot of things have changed in the background, and we're working on a lot of new tools, a few rules, and new behaviors to make Story Games a more ideal place: For our ideals, anyway, not Everyone's ideals.<br/><br/><br/><br/>...So why doesn't someone try that for a game design discussion area? Maybe one person grabs a few trusted friends, and determines what kinds of behaviors they do and do not want to see in such a community, what the goals are, what a successful site looks like, etc.<br/><br/>I'm so not interested in that: I'm not interested in design that much, and if I do dust some off and start again, I've got (better to say "built up over the years", it's not like they fell in my lap) a group of friends that would provide me that feedback. So it's not a need for me.<br/><br/>But if it's a need for others, I'd be happy to post a link to someone's forum for game design off-site if I like the look/feel of it, and offload it to that site entirely.<br/>Alternately, if some stable human being comes along and emails me saying "Hey, I got three friends together and we've got some fresh ideas for a sustainable game design forum (here they are): Can we Have/Run Praxis so that we can tear it down and rebuild it to be this kind of place?"<br/>...if the ideas sounded cool and again those folks had a track record of being stable, and they had a small group of people willing to make it happen, I'd totally turn over the keys to Praxis to a discrete admin team (or be inclined to re-merge* it after the Vanilla 2 S-G upgrade happens).<br/><br/>...but no one's been doing that, in the X years it's been open. Everyone's waiting for Someone Else to make that first move.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>* Re "merge", it's more like lock the old forum and archive it, start over fresh on the new S-G site. Merging/splicing the two databases back together isn't going to happen, for technical/time reasons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379391/#Comment_379391" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-22T20:43:31+00:00" title="May 22, 2012  8:43PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>You guys should talk about how to engineer a good game design forum.

I've talked to a few people who wanted to participate but their jobs became busier or their jobs restricted access to the Forge. Additionally, it's a lot of work. Work you could spend on your own game or building up your own blog, G+, and/or twitter. <br/><br/>All of this is why I think Jonathan's idea is neat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Story Games is pretty neat because it's public, has a lot of eyeballs, and reaches an international audience.

Walton</cite>I had grandiose plans for something for a while, but decided I didn't have the time to admin it.  In short, I bought "1-barter.net" and was planning a site where people could swap game-related goods and services (reviewing drafts, designing adventures, playtesting, artwork, ashcans, playbooks, etc.) for virtual currency measured in "barter" that they could then use to buy other things.  Basically, you could review a draft of some game in order to get a free ashcan of another game you liked. There would doubtless be a bunch of issues involved in making that work, but I think the concept is solid.</blockquote>\nIt would be cool if something like this existed. I've thought for a while about trying to barter some services, but I don't know what people want, or what I can offer that they'd consider worthwhile. I've considering posting a "who needs help?" thread, but I don't want to promise my help sight-unseen to people since I can only do good work if I believe in the project, and I wouldn't want to create false expectations.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>Maybe Story Games role in aiding designers can be a thread like "Stuff to Watch" but for game design.</blockquote>\nI think this could be cool, but figuring out a culture that got the signal-to-noise ratio right might be tricky, since there might be greater incentives for self-promotion, etc.<br/><br/>I think it would also be cool if there was some kind of curated directory of games currently in development, although that would obviously be a bit of work for somebody. I occasionally get traffic to my stuff when I post a Directed Promotion thread on the front page, but I feel a little like a spammer when I post them or bump the threads, but those sort of threads don't tend to generate discussion so they usually just migrate off the front page and stop getting noticed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379483">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379483/#Comment_379483" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-23T09:09:00+00:00" title="May 23, 2012  9:09AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Man, if "Bite Sized Design" would prevent people from relentlessly pimping their games everywhere else, that would be a huge win.

And this would also be either helpful or bothersome depending on your needs as a designer. For me, the meteor shower of random ideas here on SG has been incredibly helpful, not to mention the valuable feedback I've received to almost every question I posted here. It's been so helpful so far that I haven't actually noticed that I wasn't in a designer forum until I readed this post!

So please, everybody, have my most sincere apologies for all the inopportune design talk I've been doing here since I registered.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you were not too terribly annoyed by me at some point and could further tolerate my questions here, I'd ask for nothing more, since it's already good enough to be around the RPG experts here, specially people that are this passionate about the hobby. A designer's forum would be too much trouble anyway, OPs would need to post finished designs instead of little ideas and readers would need to go through complete games before being able to post something actually useful to the designer, who most of the time just needs to gauge the interest of an specific mechanic or setting, and most probably won't accept radical changes or heavy criticism on their unfinished designs.

Ron was kind enough to tell me the language didn't matter, but I didn't felt right using a half baked gibberish as an excuse to keep posting at the Forge. <br/><br/>On top of that it was quite painful for me to see other designer's good ideas stopped in their tracks so I wrote Ron asking him to reconsider that policy. He was so tired of moderating the arguments the old policy caused that his answer at that time was something like "I prefer to close The Forge than having it full of designers that can't commit to their work" He was right and had a point, but that didn't changed the fact that I couldn't write there about... anything. Not design doubts, not questions about other people's mechanics, not advice to other designers, nothing until I had a more complete design, which hasn't been possible to me until recently.

And saves the designer from spinning their wheels making something that's going to be crap anyway. I don't consider conversations that do that to be a waste of effort.<br/><br/>90% of everything is crap. Including game design work. Sometimes those forum threads help abort those useless pieces of crap before they see light.<br/><br/>Eventually, some of those designers work their way back around to producing something that's not crap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379682/#Comment_379682" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T14:57:13+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  2:57PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's true too!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379691/#Comment_379691" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T16:32:34+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  4:32PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But if the concern is "if you talk about your designs, you won't design" (I've read The Art of War), why does Praxis even exist?

Some of my more favorite gaming years were me sitting on the floor of my bedroom, drawing dungeons that no one would ever play.<br/><br/>Every successful designer on S-G (or anywhere) was a wanna-be designer once.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_379693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379693/#Comment_379693" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T16:39:41+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  4:39PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How would you feel about opening a Game Design category before a big convention - most obviously, GenCon, but perhaps something like Camp Nerdly - with the specific aim of designing games to playtest at that convention?<br/><br/>Because then you're designing with a purpose and a goal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379700/#Comment_379700" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-24T18:02:55+00:00" title="May 24, 2012  6:02PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>How would you feel about opening a Game Design category before a big convention - most obviously, GenCon, but perhaps something like Camp Nerdly - with the specific aim of designing games to playtest at that convention?<br/><br/>Because then you're designing with a purpose and a goal.</blockquote>\nYEAH.

The Computer masquerades with different people's voices, setting arbitrary rules. Start with extremely generic ones "Whenever any player takes a step, mark 1 point on the step chart." then get more complex, such as "Actions may or many not be taken simultaneously by different players.  Actions must be taken in order by the same player unless the player exists at two different points of space at the same time." finally, introduce strange rules "Fifteen pies will be equal to a monkey in the fourth round, but fifteen monkeys will be exchangeable for a pie or a gold brick in the fourth round.  Bricks are not actually made of gold.  Pies are actually made of gold." if you are good at becoming incoherent, do so now - have fun with it "My gosh, brother Maynard said coquettishly, pies my five for another round!  Midas milks the dog after market." <br/>\n<br/>\nAdvance the clock whenever the players miss any deadline set by themselves or by the Computer.  At any time, on a missed roll, the Computer may add new rules or deadlines.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 3:00 the walls start to shake, and any players who are still alive receive a condition (i.e. shattered). At 6:00 players receive another condition.  At 9:00 players receive another condition.  At midnight all players die.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt any time if a player completes a Game that captures the Computer's interest, the player may remove 1 conditions, and does not die at midnight.  The Computer then makes somewhat more reasonable change requests that it refers to as "quality assurance".  If the player then successfully makes the change requests, then the computer congratulates them in even more masqueraded voices than were originally used, and that player is declared to be a Winner.  Winners are uploaded to the "Winner's Lounge" via an extremely painful process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_379834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/379834/#Comment_379834" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-26T17:04:25+00:00" title="May 26, 2012  5:04PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><br/><br/><br/> If you want to post a playtest, this is the place.

Fine-tuning stuff like that for someone else is deadly dull when you haven't even played the game and that's why most design threads anywhere don't have much responses. Discussion should be on a level of creative agendas, where everyone can participate and have some general insights and the designer can walk away with a clarified idea of what he wants to design. Examples: "tell me about great fear mechanics", "what makes investigation games tick?" and "pros and cons of asymmetrical design".
