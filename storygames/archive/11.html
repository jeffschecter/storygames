                    I was going to post this on the Forge's AP forum but I'm not quite ready to do so.  Not sure what. <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=18414.0" rel="nofollow"> Largely inspired by this thread.</a><br/><br/>So, here it is:<br/><br/>A well designed game isn't going to solve the problems of a dysfunctional group. A well designedgame will very likely highlight them.<br/><br/>[b]Conflict Management[/b]<br/>I worked with kids in shitty situations in a program called the Youth Advocate Program. Many of these young men had trouble managing conflicts and it was always interesting to watch them get tools to handle conflicts and see them in action.<br/><br/>These tools did not stop their problems. They still got picked on because kids can be cruel. But they ceased to throw gasoline onto their own fires. Sometimes members of their own family would freak out because the little ways they would emotionally abuse these kids would cease to work as the kids used conflict management skills to play the game and play it well.<br/><br/>[b]Conflict Resolution[/b]<br/>A good system is like that. It isn't going to stop your players who are pricks to stop being pricks but it will stop the game itself from fueling their prickishness. These two guys who I have gamed with for years always played characters who argued.  When they played two Magi, they argued until the non-lethal Ars Magica dueling, Certamen but the Certamen's stakes were always weak (I had no idea what stakes were or what they could mean then; I thought I was Joe Progressive Gamer for allowing players to pick up NPC roles) and at the next game, if those two magi were in the same scene, back they'd be at it.<br/><br/>They argued when they were both playing D&amp;D halflings, cousins no less.<br/><br/>They took a kind of pride in that even though their characters argued, they were always there for each other when their backs were against the wall.<br/><br/>Were they saying something abou their friendship through gaming?  Where they working out some kind of frustration?  I dunno, don't much care.<br/><br/>What I do know is it bored the other playes to tears.<br/><br/>Last year we began playing Burning Wheel and Duels of Wits were par for the course.  One of these players was an Orc and the other was a Dwarf.<br/><br/>No arguments.<br/><br/>None.<br/><br/>Nada.<br/><br/>There were Duels of Wits-a-plenty but never between their two characters.<br/><br/>Maybe they had worked through what used to make them argue but I don't think so.  I think whatever they got out of prolonged arguments that came to nothing being put on the table through Duels of Wits for everyone to participate in and for a hard resolution just wasn't what they wanted.<br/><br/>Finally, my campaign was spared these long arguments.  It was lovely.  We got so much done in 4 hours I could have cried with joy.  One of these players didn't like Burning Wheel from the moment it got on the table and when his work schedule heated up, he stepped away rather gracefully, sometimes cancelling at the last minute and then finally we stopped calling him.  Another had a full-on blowout with me when he acted in a way that I didn't appreciate at the table and considered it an insult when I told him so.<br/><br/>We are set in our habits, some good and some bad.  We are challenging what gaming is and what it means and who has ownership of what.  Egos are going to get bruised some people just aren't going to like where my gaming table is going.  I am seriously wondering if many of the gamers who I used to play with regularly would fit in at my table anymore.<br/><br/>And then there are people who sit and game with me and can't imagine what we did before we did things this way and how we get more done in 4 hours now than we used to in 8 back in the day.<br/><br/>At cons I can see people either get uncomortable or get pleased as punch when I tell them that I have no idea where this game is going to end up and that they should feel free to rock this world and leave nothing for later; this table was it.<br/><br/>Tony LB talks about saying to friends, "Let's figure out something to do other than RPG's because gaming with you just isn't working for me."  I wonder how much more often that is going to happen as we find our different sweet spots and as good games like Sorcerer, DitV and BW show people to be all-out pricks.                </div>

                            Seems like the games I like to play are a real litmus test for jackassery. I'm like, maybe you're just doing that because you're frustrated with this game. Let's play a game I like. Oh, nope, you're still doing it. Okay, bye.<br/>
<br/>
The weirdest thing, I gotta say, is that the group I last bailed on absolutely loved InSpectres, yet they played it like Lord of the Flies. Every confessional was like Thunderdome. "And that's when a big pile of shit fell from the sky and landed on your character." "Oh yeah? I want a confessional now."                        </div>

                            Funny enough, I like gamist games to get a bead on people.  The goals are usually clear, the rules strict on what matters, and you can check out who can be a good sport and who has power issues and dickery when playing.                        </div>

                            I've honestly been damned lucky in that most of the groups I play with (or more often, run for) either are on the same page from the start or fall apart within a session or two.  I've been taking time to analyze the playing habits of my group, and I find them actually strangely diverse, but the games we've been playing cover a lot of different aspects, and the players are all very good friends outside the game, so conflicts are handled in a mature fashion away from the table.                        </div>

                            I tried to restart my gaming group at home, and eventually just gave up because of this. One of the players just wasn't interested in the types of games I was running, and another threw tantrums anytime something bad happened to his characters or he didn't get his way in games. I enjoy hanging out with the guy, but there was no escaping his acting like a fucking baby anytime things didn't go precisely the way he wanted them to. This really came out in Polaris.<br/>
<br/>
These are solid games that have worked for me in the past - Sorcerer, Polaris, Prime-time Adventures - but with these guys I just couldn't make it happen.<br/>
<br/>
And it's frustrating because they're the only gamers around. Luckily, I'm moving soon to a place where I know there's at least a couple of guys I can compatibly game with.                        </div>

                            I think that <i>Mountain Witch</i> was the first Forge game I read that really struck me with some of the social implications of strong player narration rights. Having narration rights means taking responsibility. It's even frequently described as responsibility; you're the person at whom the buck stops. The fewer restrictions on it there are, the less an asshole has to hide behind when its his turn. He can't even hide behind 'my guy' as an excuse for something happening, because full narration rights practically forces director stance upon him.<br/><br/>Now, there are also non-assholes who don't seem to be willing or able to take that kind of responsibility, perhaps because they're afraid of it. All I can say to that is that I ran games for several years where I was the sole source of responsibility in the game, and it's really, really tiring.                        </div>

                            I know what you mean. After years of being the GM, I was tired and I couldn't give the narration rights away soon enough when I found games like octaNe.                        </div>
