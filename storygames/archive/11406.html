Let's open the box again:<br/><br/>I want to talk about immersive roleplay. <br/>Playing <i>3:16</i> yesterday, I was struck by how anaemic the people I was running it for were, almost to the point of being standoffish. Now, I appreciate that some players don't like getting into a role, but I was really trying to draw them into the world of 3:16 - exposition, descriptions, voices; providing action and interaction. I'd pepper these offerings with questions, asking them all how they'd react, what they wanted do or gain; I'd ask them what this-or-that NPC would look like or do, or what things could be or look like.<br/>Blank. I got, at best, a suggestion that plasma should be blue, and that was only after I forced the issue. Admittedly, getting militant about it isn't the best way to engage players and immerse them in the fiction but it seemed to shake up the group and we had a more active conclusion to the mission as some troopers took the initiative and led the narrative. Not everyone, but I let the warm sun on my benevolence shine on those brave souls.<br/><br/>Perhaps my game-mastering style could be called into question, but what stayed with me after the game ended was how little incentive the players had to engage with their character (i.e. to roleplay) and the fictive world. I didn't want play to stagnate thus so I'd latch onto the most subtle of assents or indications of choice and push the narrative forward - players could easily operate purely through monosyllables and nods. After the game I breached the subject with the group and only the two who'd let themselves be drawn into the excitement on the conclusion seemed to agree with me that player-immersion was fun and desirable. <br/><br/>I respect that people have different expectations and desires of their gaming and, on a wider-scale, free-time, but I would be interested to discuss the merits or failings of immersion. Is it down to the style of game, game-master or play-group? Or a combination of those three? Is roleplay really roleplay without the roleplay?<br/><br/>-Mike.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254021/#Comment_254021" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T07:41:35+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  7:41AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't much care for chewing the scenery, unless it's interesting, and never if it gets in the way of addressing and pursuing conflict.

And if you cared to disagree, I'd point you in the direction of all the lovely posts about Proper Etiquette that have been gracing these very forums of late.<br/><br/>But here's one thought that may be of more use: I think a lot of time, GMs can underrate the very significant distance between narrativist and simulationist styles of play. A lot of my friends who are wonderful, spontaneous storytellers are very squeamish and nonplussed when other players pull faces, gesture wildly,and talk in funny voices at the gaming table. And a lot of improv theater types who roleplay with gusto are curiously inarticulate about topics such as whether the plasma should be blue. It's easier to run a game when you've settled in your mind which of these two types of "immersion" you should be aiming for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P" title="Cedric P"><img alt="Cedric P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img39.imageshack.us/img39/7180/opticnerve8s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cedric%20P">Cedric P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254058/#Comment_254058" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T09:51:55+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  9:51AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yesterday I played a game of Hot War (the project breather scenario).

It takes a few tries for newcomers to shake off the old habitual restrictions on narration, while people who come fresh to the hobby usually have less problems getting the shared input groove on.<br/>\nMost people take a while to adapt to a new thing, they start out just observing and then input once they get the hang of things, when they are sure they are not doing it wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\nCo-creating at the level of saty 3:16 is a very specific skillset that you can't just expect people to acquire on command, it's hard to learn the subtle nuances of creative permissions, even with the books in hand and good fellow players. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's for people who are actually interested in doing it, I know tons of players who prefer to participate on much lower levels, just going through the game rolling dice and collecting loot, having a blast being entertained by the gm.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end it is about making sure everyone is on the same page from the start, as in all things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254129/#Comment_254129" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T17:14:05+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  5:14PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the replies. Let me respond and clarify a few points.<br/><br/>Importantly I don't feel the issue is particularly about <i>3:16</i> itself; I could have put <i>any</i> game you'd care to suggest and the issue would've still held, the latest indie/story-game or classic D&amp;D. It's not me being underwhelmed by the attitude of my players but my disappointment at their lack of sensation (in this case, immersion) when I tried my best to stimulate them. I genuinely believe immersion in a fictional creation is fun and wish to share this with my friends. <br/><br/>However, I don't really want my players leaping about and pantomiming gun-battles. Just to mentally/verbally experience and interact with an imagined space that allows and promotes this behavior would be enough - otherwise I might as well give them a wargame or tell them to go back to <i>Mass Effect 2.</i><br/><br/>I haven't read the forge definition of immersion but I'd say it's not specifically about being enthusiastic and contributing (although these two things help a great deal) - it's about the level of interaction between you and your character and your character and the imagined space surrounding her. 'Being there', y'know. It's not a matter of simulation over narration but the combination of both to facilitate both textural/aesthetic and narrative/empathetic experiences to make a compelling whole. <br/><br/>Bill, what data?

How about your wish to share the fun of creating together?<br><br/>Also, something others have asked as well, in different words: what do you think the other players believed the fun of 3:16 was in? Any guesses or reads on that?<br/><br/>I think it is a common assumption that the fun in role-playing is mainly in playing the role. However, I'm not at all sure the assumption is correct for everybody, everywhere. I've had many experiences where I have seen the behavior of players at a table to favor another approach, instead of immersion, to playing the game to maximize their enjoyment of the game. For me too it's oftentimes more enjoyable to fight for a certain event or outcome in the story than to juts immerse in the situation of my character.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254430/#Comment_254430" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T04:55:49+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  4:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            When we play 3:16, there's a lot of character play between and in the set-up to fights.

Immersion isn't a single coherent GM-led voice sharing his vision with a group either, but that's a thought for a later post. <br/><br/>I'm not one of those who keeps quiet at the table then bemoans the lack of communication later to the interweb; I wasn't specific at the outset ("I want and expect X,Y out of you all!") but I didn't feel I was being coy about my desire to engage players with the space ("What colour? Who? When? etc etc"). To have stopped the game and demanded a change in attitude is counter-productive in regards to immersion, no? Also, a little aggressive; I was hoping all the players would rise to my style naturally and, admittedly, a couple did but not as fluently as I would have liked. As soon as play was over I drew them back to the table for a powwow, I talked about immersion and the majority seemed evasive in their opinion on the subject. If this, you feel, is just reflective of my manner as a GM, please say so. <br/><br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Was there anything that did engage them? </span><br/>Killing bugs.

See below for details.<br/><br/>When you say "immersion," I hear "player investment." (or player buy-in / player adoption / whatever your favorite buzzphrase is).  If a player sits down to play a game, I think its safe to assume there is at least a minimal amount of investment on their part.  I think to get to the next level of investment (where they actually interact with the rest of the group and show that they have a pulse), the facilitator of the game needs to determine why each player is at the table and what they expect - the quickest way I know to do so is to just ask.  If the players are having a difficult time communicating to you what they expect, ask them why they sat down at your game.  If you know what initially drew them to your table, you may have a better idea of how to draw them into the game.  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Potemkin</cite>Is roleplay really roleplay without the roleplay?</blockquote>hamana-hamana-hamana-wha??                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255164">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255164/#Comment_255164" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T04:33:15+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  4:33AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite>I think to get to the next level of investment (where they actually interact with the rest of the group and show that they have a pulse), the facilitator of the game needs to determine why each player is at the table and what they expect - the quickest way I know to do so is to just ask.

Unless they are either a) exceptionally introspective or b) acquainted with game-theory you will, without fail, get one of two answers:<br/>1. To have fun/be entertained.<br/>2. To tell a story/to roleplay (or, To kill things/get treasure/be a patrol-mouse; whatever the apparent object of the game is.)<br/>People are, in my experience, stunningly bad at rationalising and communicating their intentions and motivations, especially regarding the nonacademic sphere of leisure. <br/>Now, if a player is suggesting he's here to play at killing things, I can add more combat but that's not <i>investment</i>, that's <i>entertainment</i>. Of course, entertaining one's players is no less than the greatest good but it's not quite the same sensation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_255193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse" title="xenomouse"><img alt="xenomouse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z36/xenomouse/tophat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/xenomouse">xenomouse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255193/#Comment_255193" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-05T08:30:37+00:00" title="February  5, 2010  8:30AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Potemkin</cite>Have you ever, genuinely, asked a player what they expect from a game or why they sat down at the table?</blockquote>Yeah, I didn't mean ask them that question verbatim.
