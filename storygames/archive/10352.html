I've been running lady blackbird for my group the last couple of weekends. I've been loving it, and I intend to write an actual play some time soon.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut right now, I've got to ask: has anybody got any ways to make fight scenes more crunchy/longer? I've noticed in myself a tendency to get the whole fight wrapped up in one roll, and while this does ensure the action rolls along, I'm thinking it'll start to become dissatisfying over time. I don't (necessarily) need an actual rules hack, just some tips or suggestions would do.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo" title="theloneamigo"><img alt="theloneamigo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/546/n3LSBO7Z43MJI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/theloneamigo">theloneamigo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230163/#Comment_230163" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-05T03:11:40+00:00" title="September  5, 2009  3:11AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you seen the latest revised edition's "Obstacle and Difficulties"? The samples tend to split up a fight into several smaller obstacles, of varying difficulty. For example, the "Battle with a Sorcerer" sample obstacle suggests the following obstacles to overcome: Dodging blasts of magical fire (3), attacking Flint through his magical defenses (5), and enduring the heat and smoke as the fight wears on (3). Each smaller obstacle has its own consequences for failure and for success. Essentially, conflict-based resolution doesn't have to mean "you resolve everything in one roll".<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is probably the simplest way to make fights last longer. You could also set up a victory track or something that swings back and forth based on success and failure, but that could be a more intrusive mechanic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
