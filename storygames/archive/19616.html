They are ancient [whatevers] whom continue their existence by drinking the blood of their next host, to the death.  After doing so, they lay down for their current body to die, and 7 days later they transfer to the new body.  This is the only way, in fact, that they are immortal.  They can't shrug off damage, they don't regenerate, and their bodies age just like anyone else (unless sorcery is involved).  Nobody knows how this vampiric phenomenon started, but there are, for better or worse, more than one of these body-snatchers out there.<br/><br/>In the new body, they at first retain no visual or symbolic memories of their past "lives", although the old instincts kick in rather quickly: skills, desires, quirks, other bits of personality, etc. (more than anything else, a desperation to NOT DIE, BECAUSE I HAVE <i>SOMETHING</i> IMPORTANT TO ACCOMPLISH that supersedes all other desires when it gets right down to it)<br/><br/>And over time, pieces of the memories of their recent mortal life begins to fade as flashes of old lives replace them.  Possibly, there is a ritual that accelerates the process... or is this just brain-washing?<br/><br/>Of course, there's also the "Memento" style planning the previous incarnation of the creature systematically planned out for the next body, if such clues can actually be trusted.<br/><br/>So basically every game of this is a new conspiracy.  Set up whatever the hell you want; go wild.  Have fun.  Seems even kind of Dr. Who'ish but darker.<br/><br/>More thoughts:<br/><br/>Although, if players are going to suck on a new body once they become mortally injured, maybe the memories need to come back faster, or make it easier for party members to find ways to quickly get this new body "up to speed" and back in play.  Also, if a new mortal life needs to be "at-hand" ready to make a new body out of for a vampire to steal, there should be a system to quickly generate these mortal characters (rather than a character creation system, which would be more geared toward the vampire half).<br/><br/>I was originally thinking of this as a variant to V:tM but I think I may have deviated too far for that to work, drat.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435811">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435811/#Comment_435811" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-26T10:11:48+00:00" title="July 26, 2014 10:11AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another option for those who like more blood-sucking <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Vampires can also drink blood to regenerate their damaged body (including preventing it from aging), but this requires more blood each time (a linear scaling increase of "blood points").

One underexplored area of this game was that the characters occupied people who were "dead" in some way - sometimes physical ("mom's been in a coma for three months and now she suddenly is up and about and looks AMAZING") sometimes metaphorical ("yes, I kicked the heroin literally overnight").  Yet inside these mortals is also a seed of divinity/humanity - that seed is what makes the player character demons capable of redemption and potentially a return to the divine.  Angels and the forces of "good" (in the old World of Darkness these were best considered enforcers of a sadistic God-Creator who intentionally made an evil world so that It could feel righteous punishing and scourging it) would pursue the characters, and their fellow demons who did not have that type of redemptive "seed" would distrust and potentially even become hostile to the PCs ("hey man, how come you aren't ready to just take up the war against Heaven again?! are you.........a SPY?!?"), making that spark of humanity even more precious.  Now, unfortunately for the game line, this was among the last products that came out before the World of Darkness reboot, so most of the supplements and materials were still going over the normal "here's a faction of your type, here's a city to play in" White Wolf stuff rather than really delving into how to implement this idea fully in play.  (The new Demon, while brilliant, is very much not this game.)  So I suggest checking it out. <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/636/Demon-The-Fallen?it=1" rel="nofollow">It's $13.50 right now.</a><br/><br/>In Nomine, Steve Jackson Games' angels/demon game, also has two character types (one angelic, one demonic) that possesses mortal hosts for their awesome/dastardly deeds on Earth.  It doesn't have the thematic development that Demon: the Fallen does because (as befits the company that gave us GURPS), In Nomine is extremely flexible as to theme and setting details.  One problem was that for the demon version at least (who explicitly didn't care about their host's well-being), it was hard to balance their hosts' disposability versus the physical advantages of the other group (and the action-movie aesthetic of many IN games enhanced this. "who cares if THIS guy gets shot..." means there's no real tension.)  I would suggest reading it because it has some ideas for how to try to make it work in play, but the balance issues were never fully worked out for it.   <a href="http://www.warehouse23.com/products/in-nomine-core-rulebook" rel="nofollow">It's $17.</a><br/><br/>Hope these sources help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436039/#Comment_436039" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T10:15:09+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 10:15AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2014 10:16AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Conceptually it sounds groovy, but body-hopping during play is a tough one to make work logistically.  I can think of a few other games that have taken stabs at it (Chaosium's Nephilim, Posthuman's Eclipse Phase), but generally in even a rules-medium game changing like half your character sheet on the fly is very time-intensive, assuming the swapping happens quickly or conveniently enough in-game for your character to even keep participating (both the above games fall prey to one or both of those fail states).  In Nomine avoided a lot of this by only pegging like two or three game-mechanical bits to your physical form (HP being a big one)-- having an angelic/demonic soul was a bigger factor than your current sleeve.<br/><br/>My current idle thoughts on the subject are inspired by Base Raiders, a recent Strange FATE game about stealing bootleg super-powers, which handles physical transformations between forms (like, werewolves, the Hulk, magical girls, etc) as basically replacing or adding to your normal Aspects, which may be a little underwhelming mechanically but at least keeps the flavor with a minimum of fuss.  That or something like it may be the way to go, since you mention the possessor's past memories influencing (i.e., Compelling) and overwriting the new body's psyche...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436044/#Comment_436044" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-30T10:30:59+00:00" title="July 30, 2014 10:30AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed!

Well, I'll share my perspective on that.<br/><br/>I'm familiar with playing games both that have very low character attachment/involvement (Dungeon Crawl Classics, an OSR game) and then most other ones I've played have traditionally had higher character attachment.  So that's been in my head lately.<br/><br/>I guess my thought here was that the mortal is a low character attachment.  Some more thoughts that went through my head that I didn't post were:<br/><br/>The mortal character sheet wouldn't need stats, it could simply be a list of ways to improv a "shift" to your main character, which is this vampire parasite/spirit thing.  Perhaps a brief but interesting set of attributes for the mortal could be rolled from tables, like a lifepath system: background, personality and current events.<br/><br/>So that would be part of the game, having the opportunity to "shift" the personality of your character by overlaying this weaker personality on top of them.  Eventually the main personality comes through though because of the permanent stats on the vampire's (permanent) character sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436100/#Comment_436100" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T07:05:32+00:00" title="July 31, 2014  7:05AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting. There have been a couple stabs at coupling sort-of disposable PCs linked to a pool of resources that persists between characters, but you don't see it too often and they're games nobody generally played.  I want to say there have been a couple "theatrical" games where you have a "real" character playing a role which changes their stats, and obviously character death doesn't mean having to reroll a new guy from scratch (I think Dream Park, and maybe one version of Hong Kong Action Theater worked this way?).  TSR's old Amazing Engine also had something along those lines, where, like, you had an "overcharacter" whose sheet would then get "translated" into the different genres of the available settings, and you could either spend XP on improving the specific character you were playing, or funnel it back into the ur-character, which would benefit any later character derived from it.  But I also remember that system being unintuitive and way above my crunch threshold so I never really tried it.<br/><br/>I kinda like the idea of having the vampire basically govern the mental/social parts of the character, with the current host providing the physical and maybe some modifiers or bonuses to the vampire mind (maybe that's how advancement works, like Final Fantasy 9 and other CRPGs where your gear has inherent bonuses and skills but if you use it long enough you can use the skills without having it equipped.  Maybe that's the ONLY way a static, parasitic creature like a vampire can learn things), and the random lifepath part sounds neat but again, my rules preference would be somewhere along the lines of FATE just because historically, crunchier systems make managing this stuff more trouble than I personally think it's worth.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436101/#Comment_436101" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T07:42:29+00:00" title="July 31, 2014  7:42AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think a lot of those concerns only have weight if you're assuming that physical skills and attributes are important to the game.

(Something like AW's improvements and moves might be a good model here.)<br/><br/>This would be cool because it would give you a real sense of how much power the character has as well as *who they are*. Oh, look: now he remembers about his wife dying in a fire. So he also gets [relevant supernatural ability]. By extension, we can infer which emotions and perspectives the character is now drawing on from his past life (if the "host body" was a happy-go-lucky youth, suddenly they're drawing on this well of grief and regret), and possibly what he remembers (we can assume that the character regains access to memories from that specific period of his life, and might, for example, recognize an NPC who was present around the time of that incident).<br/><br/>That sounds like fun to me, anyway: connect each "vampiric power" or unusual skill with some significant historical/personal milestone and then allow the character in the "new body" to reclaim them slowly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ONE_SHOT" title="ONE_SHOT"><img alt="ONE_SHOT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ONE_SHOT">ONE_SHOT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436108/#Comment_436108" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-31T10:20:30+00:00" title="July 31, 2014 10:20AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the idea of vampiers not being able to retain all of their memories, They still need vast estates with libraries and trinkets from their other lives so they can trigger their memories.

Particularly if the actual feeding process limits how many powers you can "carry over". On a real good success/with a really perfect (virgin?) body/under ideal circumstances, you can manage to regain all your powers.<br/><br/>But under normal circumstances, you don't get ALL of them (although hopefully most). This creates a history for your vampire, who regains powers and memories... but never completely. That's how characters change over time/advance in this system.<br/><br/>It also explains why "new" vampires are weak: they haven't regained/figured out/remembered all their "moves" yet. But, give them time, and access to tools, information, and foci (as ONE_SHOT suggests, above - excellent idea!), and they will regain their full powers pretty quickly.<br/><br/>I like the idea of the vampire leaving behind information (a la <i>Memento</i>), giving themselves a depository of information and power, as well as leaving a trail of breadcrumbs for their missions and goals.<br/><br/>It's often a premise in this type of fiction that an ancient, powerful being has a depository of power, like a tomb, an old mansion/castle, or a wizard's tower. But it's rarely significant in RPG terms: it rarely translates into workable mechanics.<br/><br/>Here, the effect would be powerful: if I do some research and find your ancestral family's castle, I might be able to find your old library, with your letters from your beloved grandmother. If I go there and destroy them... you will know that the next time you die and transfer to a new body, you will lose those memories as well as abilities/powers/moves they are connected to. That stings! You're going to come after me, with sweet revenge in mind. <br/><br/>I like it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436210/#Comment_436210" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-01T20:31:19+00:00" title="August  1, 2014  8:31PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes Paul, that's exactly how the idea was striking me.<br/><br/>Abilities are tied much less to physical/mental resources and much more to experience and knowledge (even muscle memory is ultimately memory).<br/><br/>You've said a lot of great stuff already about theme and premise, so I'll continue on this track a but about character abilities.<br/><br/>The vampire's primary abilities could all be recovered, and could be from two sources: mastered skills (how good do you think a 800 year old swordsman would be?) and supernatural abilities.  <br/><br/>The host-body's attributed would then function purely as some kind of "burnable" resource.  For exaple, let's take a classic three: Mind, Body and Personality.  Each host body would have a different configuration of the three, but these stats could play somewhat less of a role than in many other RPGs.  For example, notice I called them resources.  Rather than the standard of "roll attribute + skill" you could do a system as follows:<br/><br/>As long as you possess some of a given attribute left, your bonus when performing some action is equal to your skill + 1.  For those exceptional moments, you may really exert yourself by burning up one of your three attributes to go even higher.<br/><br/>Examaple: My vampire is in Bruce's body.  Bruce has a current Body stat of 4 (max of 4, too) and Martial Arts skill of 2.  Because he has some Body points available, any rolls using his martial abilities will be at a +3 (or 3 dice, or whatever), because 2 + 1 = 3.  If he, say, gets into a really nasty fight, he can exert extra force in one roll by spending all 3 Body points.  This would get him to +6 (3 + 3 = 6).  But now he's totally exhausted with a Body stat of 0, so further attempts to use martial arts will only be at the skill's base level of 2.  Also, since this is his Body stat, if he happens to receive another blow, he's going to be out of commission.<br/><br/>Alright, I didn't plan to take this into actual game design territory, but I thought maybe this example of a possible system shows how the host-body's physical attributes can be relevant (And kind of cool how each body has you playing your vampire differently) without ruining the charactcer concept.<br/><br/>And ultimately, the body switching thing wouldn't be happening super often anyway.  It's more like a "phase" of the game; get used to the new body and move on with it.  If you fuck up royally and get mortally wounded again... well, you'll go through the phase again in a new "suit" and then you're back on the horse.

It's when a player <i>really wants to all but guarantee</i> (because of notably high stakes, as in a "big scene") that she's successful: when researching that table-turning sorcery or blood artifact; when in a fight to the death against another enclave's assassin; when trying to convince an elder to let you control this section of the police department; etc.  This conveniently lines up with legends of vampires being extraordinarily intelligent, strong, convincing, quick, etc.  <br/><br/>I see two similar paths, here:<br/><br/>1) Effort pools (mind, body, personality) replenish by drinking blood, without killing.  Killing is only necessary to switch bodies.<br/><br/>2) Effort pools replenish only by murdering and taking a new body<br/><br/>In either case, one reason a Redemption archetype might be interesting in this setting is that a Vampire might actually choose, regardless of their past, to stop drinking blood and murdering.  This puts them in a bind though, because all the vampires that don't care will still do so and have an advantage.  But it's a neat situation and one that I can see being interesting for multiple characters among a party.  They stick together to survive, and they're loyal to each other, but maybe sometimes they go through these episodes where one or more of them "gets a conscience" from one of their bodies and it actually sticks.<br/><br/>I think I lean towards the "every time you drink, you get a new body" hardline take, because it makes all active vampires murderers and seems to fit with the original concept. I believe V:tM didn't do this for logistical reasons (too many vampires and too much fighting/magic meant there needed to be an economy of blood flowing, not an glut of murders which would have threatened the Masquerade).<br/><br/>BTW, the Masquerade is obviously a topic that requires thought.  Even if it's simply "there is none".  Although, personally I've always been fond of how the Masquerade creates and enforces politics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436307">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436307/#Comment_436307" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T08:34:15+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  8:34AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2014 8:35AM by Big_J_Money.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>One underexplored area of this game was that the characters occupied people who were "dead" in some way - sometimes physical ("mom's been in a coma for three months and now she suddenly is up and about and looks AMAZING") sometimes metaphorical ("yes, I kicked the heroin literally overnight").  Yet inside these mortals is also a seed of divinity/humanity - that seed is what makes the player character demons capable of redemption and potentially a return to the divine. </blockquote>\nSorry for taking so long to get to this JD.  I'm thinking definitely no <i>guaranteed </i>seed of divinity, here.  The "truth" is obscured behind the past, and getting to it is part of the fun.  I think one of the appeals of this game is that the GM is allowed to create a different back-story and a different conspiracy(ies) in each play.  Maybe vampires are some kind of fallen spirit with a chance to regain (or create) some nobility.  But maybe not.  I think what makes the game human in this sense is the "not knowing the ultimate reality, but still having to make a decision about your character's actions".  In addition, you get a little bit of "drama juice" every time your vamp gets a new body because it's a literal shift in personality.  How much do these mortal personalities stick to your vampire, if at all?  Maybe they didn't the last 10 times, but what about <i>this time</i>?<br/><br/>Re: other morals recognizing changes in the "person". That is a possibility.  If a person was killed and not seen by family or acquaintances in the last 7 days, they might not have caught up on the news that their loved-one is actually dead.  That seems to me to be right on the line of providing some play for a good mystery feel for the investigative side of the game.<br/><br/>Re: the specific changes, I wonder in what ways focusing on the physiological changes might help the game.  Obviously there might be some ground to be gained there in the horror/monster aspects.  We know these creatures are monsters by the way they kill for their own gain, but in what ways can that motif be highlighted by mechanics (or even just descriptions) of their undead bodies?<br/><br/>I'll have to think on that some more.<br/><br/>In the meantime, I'm thinking about what the moral dilemmas really are.  So you have this creature that, once injured will die.  It doesn't heal naturally. The creature's "natural" way of continuing its existence is to kill a mortal.  This sets it on a separate moral plane from humans (like an alien).  This doesn't strike me as a desirable moral dilemma since the creature <i>can't</i> effectively identify as a person, so I think I'd like to tweak it.  But I'll hold off to see how other people feel, first.  Maybe I'm not giving that concept a fair shake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436309/#Comment_436309" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T09:15:28+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  9:15AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the game world, Demons were not guaranteed to hit a host that had that seed that made redemption possible - but every single player characters had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money" title="Big_J_Money"><img alt="Big_J_Money" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Big_J_Money">Big_J_Money</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436343/#Comment_436343" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-03T19:38:07+00:00" title="August  3, 2014  7:38PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2014 7:44PM by Big_J_Money.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, I see what you mean.<blockquote>I like the idea of vampiers not being able to retain all of their memories, They still need vast estates with libraries and trinkets from their other lives so they can trigger their memories.
