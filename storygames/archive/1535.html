                    We just played a seven-person game of <a href="http://www.shadowsovercamelot.com/" rel="nofollow">Shadows Over Camelot</a> and holy crap, it is distilled rock and roll.  <br/><br/>Production values:  A+.  Beautiful art, beautiful sculpts, beautiful cards and boards.  It takes up a lot of room but all the fiddly bits work well.<br/><br/>Mechanics:  A+.  Brilliant.  A cooperative game that scales seamlessly with player count, ratchets up tension effectively, and has a built-in, elegant end game mechanic - when you finish quests, cards that would otherwise hinder those quests instead become resources that press the game toward a (failed) conclusion for the knights.  <br/><br/>Pacing:  A+.  Fast - your turn is constrained to a handful of choices and the game moves fast.  You are engaged and involved throughout.  Plus it doesn't take four hours to play - we rocked out in an hour and a half and only one guy had ever played before, and that was a <em>seven person game</em>.  <br/><br/>If you play board games, go in with your pals and buy a copy of SoC.  My mind is already racing over the cooperative mechanics and how to apply them, or some distillation, to current projects.                </div>

                            I have an interest in "party games" like Mafia and Werewolf, which from what I hear are in the same family as SoC. How does the system take that mechanical premise and add new <i>stuff</i> that doesn't make it feel like something extraneous tacked on to a free game?                        </div>

                            I keep forgetting how relatively unknown this game is.  It is in my mind one of the most important board games of the past couple of years.<br/><br/>Andy, to answer your question: The big thing I learned from my first game of SOC was that the game itself can act as a fit form of opposition (at least in some cases).  That is, while in RPGs we have traditionally assigned the role of opposition to a <i>player</i> (the GM), it may well be possible for the game mechanics to take care of this (or at least a large part of it).  This opens up interesting possibilities for solo play, and it (along with Breaking the Ice) point the way toward some interesting two-player cooperative stuff.  (Though I will note, because it is important here, that I don't think SOC would be nearly as compelling without the traitor mechanics.  Every game you play, it is possible that one of the players is out to sabotage your effort.  This adds a sense of human adversary, even if there isn't one.)<br/><br/>Daniel, yeah.  It's very much in line with Mafia, but with some very nice (what I consider to be) refinements.  1.  The question of a traitor is not answered before play.  So instead of trying to simply figure out <i>who</i> it is, you have to wonder if there even is one.  2.  More importantly, it provides a proactive goal for the non-traitors.  You win if you accomplish the victory conditions, not just because you outsmarted the traitor.  This puts a shifting time pressure on the game as a whole: it's possible that you can pull a rush to victory before the traitor can fully hamstring you.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            While I agree that SoC and Mafia have a lot of similarities, the difference to me is that in SoC the Mafia part is, as best I can determine, played out non-mechanically on top of the game itself, which is already hard enough as it is. Yes, there are mechanics for accusing traitors, but unlike Mafia those mechanics are not the entire game. Also unlike Mafia, being exposed as a "bad guy" does not remove you from play -- it just makes your play more straightforward. <br/><br/>Of course, I've only had a chance to play the game once, and we played four people without a traitor -- and barely won (and I do mean barely, almost every conceivable player resource spent.) To be honest I am curious if winning against a competent traitor is even possible, though I have faith enough in the game to believe that it is.                        </div>

                            I've got to agree, that game totally rocks.  Our group of seven got together and ran two sessions of the game.  The think that makes the game tick is the possibility that there's a traitor among the Table Round.  Surprisingly, when we played the first time, there was no traitor, but the possibility that there might be a traitor nearly paralyzed us and we almost lost the game!  The second game I was the traitor, but due to good play between the knights, it was nearly impossible for me make the others lose.  In fact, in that game I was more or less forced to play the winning card to achieve victory for Camelot.<br/><br/>Looking at the game, I can see how the game would change depending on the number of players.  With only three or four playing, the card churn would be so quick that the knights would be forced to return to Camelot to constantly replenish their hands.  With fewer players, the traitor only has to drag his feet every so often to help bring down Camelot.  With seven players, we were able to work together and focus on specific quests to thwart the traitor; with so many actions taking place between turns, the traitor didn't seem to have a chance to plot out an effective strategy in the seven-player game.                        </div>

                            Everyone is harping on the traitor mechanic. While I found it interesting and useful, I found it didn't affect play terribly much. It's hard to be a really good traitor. The first game I played, I was the traitor. I played along with everyone else, cooperated as much as possible, but made sure my choices were the weakest possible without arousing suspicion. I won, but mostly because the other players lost.<br/><br/>The first thing I really took away from this game is the fact that players can join or drop from the game at any time. Since every turn includes Bad Stuff and then the player's go, there's not a big impact on the player count going up or down as play progress. Yes, you gain or lose some special abilities of the knights in question, but one of them might have been the traitor anyway. I do wonder if it might not be an easier game to win with fewer players (say, three or four) than the full complement.<br/><br/>The last thing I really took away from this game, and I'm trying to apply it to my current RPG design, is that you bring your own Bad to the game. Since every turn includes Bad Stuff happening and then your go, things remain balanced. This ties in to my first point, but what I like about this part is the idea of a game where players can pool their efforts on something, but in doing so, more things might go wrong. In an RPG, it might work something like this: if one player participates in a conflict, the GM rolls X dice in opposition, and for every additional player who participates, the GM gets +X dice to his pool. It still might prove worthwhile for other players to get involved, as they might have abilities or expertise that might really help the conflict, but it dissuades players from dogpiling just to get a bunch of rolling done. There's an element of this in Dogs, as it is, in that anyone participating in a conflict is going to have to See and has the potential to get Fallout from a conflict. It really adds a choice to things. At the game level, this mechanic is fantastic for forcing the players to cooperate, as every bit of Bad Stuff brings all the players closer to losing the whole game, so there's more social pressure and table talk to have an agree-on group strategy.<br/><br/>Just my two cents' worth.                        </div>

                            There are direct lessons for a certain kind of RPG.  I've been working on Grey Ranks for a while, and it has always had an explicit escalation structure - you have things you must do to avoid personal catastrophe, and those things get harder and harder as the game progresses, to the point where you have to stop fighting the inevitable and start making ugly, ugly choices.  SoC does this very nicely in a refined way, so I'm going to be taking a harder look at it for inspiration.                        </div>

                            I agree that it's really rather difficult to be the Traitor. Strategies I've seen work include:<br/><br/>Pretending to be tired, or not really engaged with the game, or a bit slow with the rules, and play suboptimally. One knight who isn't pulling his weight can hamper the entire Round Table.<br/><br/>Going for Lancelot's Armour - its special power is especially useful to the Traitor, winning the quest doesn't give the goodies too many victory points, and completing the quest will tie your character up for a while.<br/><br/>Similarly, going on a solo quest, taking ages to go about it, and playing suboptimally is a good tactic. It means your knight isn't available to help with other things, and if you lose the quest you get black swords on the board.<br/><br/>One of the knights - I think Sir Tristram - can look at two of the "evil" cards when he draws them and pick which one to play. "Whups, sorry guys... trust me, though, the other card was worse. <i>Heh heh heh...</i>"                        </div>

                            I played a 7-player SOC once, and I enjoyed it, especially the cooperative part, but I wasn't blown away. I think we lost to the traitor, but it was an above average experience.<br/><br/>Good cooperative games a few and far between. I haven't tried LotR, mostly because of the tematic content. Adrienne, a girl from my regular boardgaming group loves SoC and cooperative games, so I have been searching for a while. I have been zooming in on <a href="http://www.vanishedplanetgames.com/main/index.php?page=Game" rel="nofollow">Vanished Planet</a>, where you also play against the game. It's cheap and looks really good. The feedback on Boardgamegeek is mostly positive, but Scott Nicholson - <a href="http://boardgameswithscott.com/" rel="nofollow">Boardgames With Scott vlog</a> - told me he sold his copy because it was "too fiddly", so I didn't have the nerve to order it. Any of you guys know it or have played it?<br/><br/>Per                        </div>

                            Well, an obvious traitor strategy is to a) attempt to acquire any of the three artifacts then b) falsely accuse a knight at the first opportunity, which will almost certainly be followed by c) being revealed as the traitor, allowing you to spend the rest of the game explicitly supporting your cause. This also results in the artifact being lost, one way or the other. I'm not convinced that the best way to play the traitor is to try and hide the fact past a certain point, though there certainly are some obstructive options that go out the window once you are revealed.                        </div>

                            Daniel,<br/><br/>I really disagree about not hiding your traitorous nature past a certain point. The tactics that Arthur suggests are all good ones - I've employed at least half of them. Accusing a knight gets you accused, only gets one black sword on the table, and costs you a lot of power. Remember, too, that if they complete the game but haven't revealed you, two white swords turn black, so if you are able to sneak by as the traitor the whole game, there's still the chance that they haven't done *well enough* and those two flips cost them the game. Usually, though, the game is tough enough and you've been subtle enough that they lose regardless. In particular, I love being the traitor and having it come around to my turn with 11 seige engines on the table. Then you can just make them lose. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I love SOC, and for months it was our go-to game on Tuesday nights.  But I'm...  gonna step out here and say that I think the mechanics have some faults.<br/><br/>Chief among them is that the only player with any real choices is the traitor.  Once you're an informed player with a little experience (and once you understand the ratio of, say, Grail cards to Despairs), your choices come down to "go immediately to the quest where your cards will be most effective" and "lose."  Sometimes there's a little leeway here, like if you've got a full house and neither the Black Knight nor Lancelot is occupied--but even then, Lancelot has such better rewards that it's just a calculated risk based on the black cards already played.<br/><br/>Another problem, to me, is the table-talk rule.  I understand the purpose:  the game would be lose a lot of atmosphere (and choices for the traitor) if you could say "I have a run but I'm missing a two, somebody want to back me up at the Saxons?"  In practice, though, it just serves to punish inexperienced groups.  The Tuesday-night group I mentioned above can, at this point, communicate volumes without ever naming a card or a quest ("I'm going <i>home</i> soon unless somebody can back me up with a <i>heavy hitter?</i>  I mean, not too heavy, but...").  That wasn't possible when we started playing, and it wouldn't likely be possible in a pickup game.<br/><br/>Finally, as has been mentioned elsewhere, the pressure to win almost always comes from the siege engines, not the Table.  The pace of engine-placement increases dramatically as the game continues, whereas the pace of black-sword placement remains the same or even slows.  This leads to a lot of games where you're hoping to "win by losing"--everybody sits at home and draws cards to fight catapults, hoping that they'll draw enough Black Knights to fill the table (which already has a majority of white swords).  The anticlimax can be remedied by houseruling that you have to win a quest to end the game, but that doesn't fix the pacing issue.                        </div>

                            Brendan you're dead on about the pressures of siege engines, but I personally consider it to be a feature rather than a bug.  It's a desperate scramble to keep the castle standing, especially if you've complete the Grail and Excalibur quests.  Honestly, I think the game plays better as a once in a while game, the system can be worked easily towards victory for the knights barring either a) an excellent and well placed traitor, or b)  serious dissension in the knightly ranks.<br/><br/>Also, the kind of table talk you're describing is really a violation of spirit of the table talk rule.  You might as well just come out and say you're returning to Camelot unless someone can throw down a fight 4.  Table talk is one of the biggest problems with the game, and I think it'd be more fun if you can get everyone to <i>completely</i> eliminate it.  I have this problem a lot, because most of the people I play with really get into analyzing what is the 'best' move for each other, and so forth.                        </div>

                            It's an amusing play the first couple of times, but then it really, really, really bogs down with the weight of experience and expectations.<br/>
<br/>
We played it a lot, but after a while, we've found the group consensus that builds is very problematic: anyone that steps out of the way of the winning formula gets hammered down hard. First: most people jump on board for the grail quest. By common consensus nobody goes on the Lancelot quest except for a randomly determined person. The person who inevitably headed out on the quest was always the traitor. Knight abilities mean that everyone has a role to play, and in our experience, this inevitably means a pre-scripted set of play.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, this is a real problem. Every time we adhere to this strategy we win. The minute we veer from it we lose. So this is a game that you might want to see how it plays out over time, but I think there are some lessons to be learned from it.                        </div>

                            We played it a couple of times and enjoyed it quite a bit.  The first time, we played without a traitor and managed a narrow victory.  The second time we dealt out the cards, were terribly suspicious of each other, and lost when Excalibur whisked back across the lake several cards in a row.  When we revealed and there was no traitor, everyone was suprised... the discussion afterwards (about people's acts and what "tip offs" led us to our incorrect conclusions) was interesting.                        </div>

Ah, I'd forgotten.<br/><br/>There's still interesting possibilities for screwing with the early-warning system ("hmm, neither of these cards really hurts them, I'll stick on another siege engine instead"), and once the group catches on to the idea that the Armour is a tool for the Traitor that only opens up <i>more</i> possibilities, not less - you can falsely accuse someone and credibly say "I'm so, so sorry, you just seemed so keen to get the Armour", and if everyone's reluctant to go for the armour that makes it more and more likely that that quest will fail - in which case you get black swords on the Round Table, and the Armour is lost to the goody-goodies <i>forever</i>.<br/><br/>Edit to add: Oh, and the Fate cards are no real test of who the Traitor is anyhow, since the Traitor always has the option of playing them as if he were a normal knight. Good way to shake off suspicion.                        </div>

                            Reading the Camp Nerdly is Nigh thread has made me realize that we need some variant on Shadows Over Camelot that re-themes it as a camping weekend undertaken by a bunch of young people, wherein one player is secretly the Traitor/serial killer.
