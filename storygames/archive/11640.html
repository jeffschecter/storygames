Take that NPC out of whatever front she\u2019s in, list her in a whole new place, home instead of the home front.<br/><br/>Furthermore, stop looking at this NPC through crosshairs. She has been set apart, safe from death, to a higher purpose. By now the players are bone weary from knowing that every single NPC is, at her heart, only a potential threat to them. Now, this one person, they can breathe.</i><br/>-----<br/><br/>It was truly wonderful. "Now, this one person, they can breathe."

Lord, how it rocked.<br/><br/>Things did not go well for Aknut O'Malley, the fifteen-year old, pregnant, half-Inuit pole-vaulter - she ended up in a group home. Dexter Higgs, the coach of her track team and former meth addict, hardly fared better - after almost being killed by the father of Aknut's child, whom he was trying to blackmail, he lost his job and his wife when a bunch of listless teenagers found his carelessly abandoned bag of homemade pipe bombs and blew up the local breakfast diner (<i>Four Mooses and a Duck</i> was, as I recall, the name of the unhapppy establishment). Dex ended up employed as the alcoholic gravedigger of a cemetery on the Kaku Inlet. Hans Ulrich, Dexter's AA sponsor and pusher (not as paradoxical as it sounds - he was getting Dexter to kick his Meth habit with the help of 'shrooms) had a pretty good endgame, hooking up with Dex's abandoned spouse and cashing in the stock certificates he dug out of Aknut's father's grave for a small fortune.<br/><br/>Is this a well-designed game? I honestly have no idea - I really couldn't tell you what all of Jason's fiddly dice rules are supposed to add up to, at the end of the day. Is it an <i>awesome</i> game? Oh yes indeed.

Alice and Wonderland.<br/>And we start playing out a scene where Alice chases the White Rabbit into the rabbit hole, and emerges into Wonderland.<br/>And then he takes over playing Alice, and as she's exploring Wonderland she keeps asking the characters she finds if they have a "talker".<br/>I'm really confused, but he doesn't explain what he means... instead, he just keeps playing it, straight-faced.<br/>And so I get one of the Wonderland characters to ask Alice what she means by a talker, and she says "I don't know really, I just use it to talk to the voices when I need help."<br/><br/>And then he (the guy I'm playing with) jumps back to the Star Trek universe.<br/>He's playing Picard.<br/>Someone on the USS Rabbit is sending a distress signal! It's Alice!<br/>We beam over, and are told that Alice should be in the holodeck.<br/>We enter the holodeck, but no sign of Alice.<br/>We yell, but there's no response.<br/><br/>Then he jumps back to the Wonderland thread, and we're Alice and the Mad Hatter again.<br/>And Alice hears these voices in the sky, and asked the Mad Hatter what's going on.<br/>And I'm about to respond, when he (the guy I'm working with) interrupts me to say "No, you don't respond, because you go all static-y."<br/><br/>And it's at that moment when I piece it together.<br/>Alice encountered a glitch in the holodeck program, a virus that converted the scene into Wonderland and trapped her there.<br/>Captain Picard has come to save her, but he's on the other side of the glitch.<br/>WTF. *head explodes*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261555/#Comment_261555" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-12T01:50:40+00:00" title="March 12, 2010  1:50AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DUUUUUUUUDE.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262335/#Comment_262335" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T13:55:06+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  1:55PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran Diaspora last night.

People drank space beers, smoked space cigars, and fought space bears.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262340/#Comment_262340" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T14:31:31+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  2:31PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playtested Jason Morningstar's cool new <i>Trail of Cthulhu</i> module "The Black Drop" last night.

Highlights included a swamp chase, multiple beatings with an extension cord, a car being stolen four times, and a stepchild committing an unwholesome act against a stepparent. My character, the Gypsy, went to women's prison for the rest of her natural life. <br/><br/>Game 2: A CPA and his computer hacker underling scheme to use a computer program to creatively account for missing money, and get found out by a his long lost cousin / bounty hunter and an ex-con living in a van down by the river. After two separate attempts to get the ex-con to kill various people, a corporate barbecue results in a string of accidents and attempted murders, including the CPA's daughter throwing a chemistry set into a fire, and the ex-con accidentally blowing up the bounty hunter's car with him in it. My character, the CPA, ends up in a long court battle over the negligent death of his daughter. <br/><br/>Game 3: A heroin dealer and his one night stand reunite when the guy they accidentally killed 6 months ago almost gets discovered in a raid on a seedy duplex. A pimp, a rich-kid raver, and the raver's real estate mogul uncle all try and pin a totally unrelated accidental death and a heroin ring on just about everybody, resulting in the most epic office chair chase sequence ever seen. My raver character ended up with the most positive ending of any of my characters over the weekend, merely being abandoned without a passport in Argentina. <br/><br/>As a side note, just to point out how awesome and reusable the Fiasco playsets are, all three of the groups used Tales from Suburbia as their playset.

The extremely evil slavers who showed up in the one shot returned, and I felt a visceral wave of dread as they approached. My Gunlugger, Midgett, knew precisely how bad these guys were, and we had a few gloriously intense moments of argument between those of us who <i>knew </i>and those of us who wanted to carry on with the pissant job we were on.<br/><br/>There was fire and death and when it was all over a dozen slavers surrendered.

The guys who joined in were very enthusiastic about the <i>Wild West Boomtown </i>setting, which I'd never played before. One of them was a theatre student and the other was a technical writer - both were <i>Pathfinder</i> fiends with lots of RPG experience but none whatsoever on the indie scene.<br/><br/>Bu the end of the whole vast clusterfuck, my character Big John "Toothless" Bustamente, the Sherriff of Greasy Gulch, had been exposed as an escaped convict, fallen off his horse, and stumbled ass-first into a campfire. His former partner Jesse managed to escape town with 50% of the swag from their former crimes, but got thrown in jail by a crooked judge when he tried to buy a cattle ranch in unfriendly territory. Xi Bai Wang, Jesse's mail-order bride (aside: the cheesy name was not my choice, and drew some censorious looks from the <i>Pathfinder</i> wonks over at the next table - oh well) had been abducted by a tribe of Indians, subsequently ostracized by their womenfolk, and ended up deciding to live out the rest of her disappointing life as a hermit in a burned out log cabin in the desert. <br/><br/>By the end of the session we were all in hysterics, and they were clamouring for more info about the game.

They decide to hit up the local mall to see what can be found at the (probably ransacked) Radioshack. As they wander through the mall, they hear a crash, and duck for cover in an old jewelery shop. While Frankie checks it out up ahead, Alan heads to the back to see what he can find. He comes across an old safe, and gets to work trying to jury-rig it. Frankie sees a mid-level lackey of Wisher, Pellet, beating the shit out of another of Wisher's lackeys. A female voice comes from the floor below, "Has he said anything yet?" Pellet says no, and proceeds to chop the guys head off with his machete. Frankie goes back to check on Alan, but he can't get it to work right without something. (8 on Rolling Under Fire).<br/><br/>They decide to approach Pellet, as he's standing right in front of the Radioshack. Pellet does not look pleased, but he lets them by, as they tell him they work for Wisher too. Once inside the Radioshack, they find some shit, but nothing super great. As they prepare to leave, they hear a crunch and a low voice right outside the shop. Frankie reads the situation (4) but doesn't notice anything wrong, just thinks it's Pellet outside. As he moves, a grenade flies through the glassless storefront. They both dive for cover behind the POS desk. Halfway there, it goes off, and they hit the floor. Pellet and the girl come around the corner, the girl spraying bullets. Alan yells, "Hey! We're on your side! We can work this out peacefully!" but fails to seize control of the situation (6), and leaves his legs exposes, which get hit by her bullets. Frankie leaps to his feat, going aggro on Pellet (10), and deals him 3-harm with his shotgun. Pellet drops to the floor, dead. The girl aims and fires again, aiming for Alan, who is still exposed.<br/><br/>Alan, though, goes aggro on her, with his .38 revolver, and hits her right in her shoulder (9, sucking it up). They leap over the counter, check Pellet and the chick, who's in mild shock, grab their gear and her gun, and walk out of the store just in time to see a third dude they'd not noticed running down the hall the same way they'd come. To be safe, they take a detour back to their car, to find that the windshield had been cracked and and to see that guy driving away down the road on his chopper, in the direction of Whispers lair. They hop in the car, and drive back to Alan's workshop, now in some deep shit.<br/><br/>Noah                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_264286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/264286/#Comment_264286" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-28T16:31:48+00:00" title="March 28, 2010  4:31PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11668&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">third</a> <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11744&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">session</a> of our Apocalypse World playtest, Cullen the savvyhead instructs Jeanette the NPC angel in how to save Cullen's gangrene-filled arm.

Operator Proust is the man with the plan, Savvyhead Jessica is a beautiful and compassionate mechanic, Angel Gabe is a medic who wishes they really WOULD dig a well once or twice, and Brainer Cybelle is a transsexual lover of humanity, in every sense (who\u2019s fond of Jessica). As their rig stalls out in the middle of nowhere, low on \u201cgo juice,\u201d they\u2019re attacked by the men of Esco, a local enclave leader they\u2019ve robbed, wanting back not so much their loot, but Jessica with whom Esco is smitten. There\u2019s gunplay and Jessica is shot and in a bad way. Next thing we know, the band is captured, the Operator and Brainer laboring in the Slave Pits, while the Angel is chained in the infirmary, tending to Jessica.<br/><br/>Gabe heals Jessica, but the first face she sees on waking is Esco\u2019s, and she realizes he\u2019s a good man and she cares for him. About then Proust makes his play\u2013threatening to blow the whole place with an artillery shell dug up in the Slave Pits, unless Esco lets them all go. Esco says fine but the girl stays, and that\u2019s when Cybelle makes HER play\u2013using her Brainer gifts, she brushes Esco\u2019s shoulder and murmurs, \u201cshow us the girl. I\u2019ll stay with you until they\u2019re safely away.\u201d<br/><br/>Esco is totally swayed\u2013he suddenly has eyes only for Cybelle, and orders his men to release everyone. As Gabe is ushering Jessica out, her eyes lock with Esco\u2019s and she sees total indifference, and it shakes her. Cybelle is led off and lets Esco have his way with her, which for a Brainer lays his mind bare: she feels all his burden and regrets, and sees that his heart is broken over losing Jessica, twice. She further sees that if this breaks him, his community will not survive. While Esco sleeps, Cybelle is overwhelmed in the Psychic maelstrom.<br/><br/>Enter Jessica. She comes bearing a bowl of water, a symbol of healing and reconciliation. She holds it out before her, in the center of the triangle of lost souls. As Esco awakes and Cybelle comes to herself, understanding and forgiveness pass between them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item
