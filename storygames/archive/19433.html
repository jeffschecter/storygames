They recently added some new options specifically to address the needs of Kickstarter creators delivering digital rewards to backers. <br/><br/>That said, in terms of delivering POD rewards, they don't have a solid mechanism for that in place yet. You could probably make arrangements with them to use a coupon code or discount to make the books free to your recipients, but they'd still need to have an account at Drivethru and order the books, pay for shipping, etc.<br/><br/>A lot depends on how many copies you expect to print. Depending on the quantity, I'd suggest having the books printed (POD for a few, digital for a few hundred copies, offset for more) and contract with a fulfillment partner to mail them all out. That's assuming you have enough orders that you don't want to do it yourself.<br/><br/>For <i>Durance</i> we were fortunate to be able to print one large order at an offset printer and ship them all to our local game store and fulfillment partner, Atomic Empire. We gave them a list of recipients and had them mail everything out for a small handling fee.<br/><br/>Let me know if I can be of more help!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432536/#Comment_432536" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T12:01:24+00:00" title="May 13, 2014 12:01PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Theoretically, you could buy them and ship them to your backers, or you could also use the "buy at cost" option that I've seen popping up places.

As suggested above, you can do this by e.g. offering a coupon for a PDF+print product at a POD company where the customer can pay for the book (possibly with binding options or whatever) at production cost, assuming they even want a physical book - so they pay <i>you</i> only for the content, the rest is between them and the chosen POD printer. (Yes, the true progressive would let the customer choose the printer, too.) Alternatively, you can take the money for the book and sell through the POD company at 0+shipping (assuming their terms enable you to do this with a coupon or something); that'll still save you a mass of headache in terms of fulfillment logistics, and removes the need to predict the shipping costs at this stage. Also, some of those coupons will remain unused despite having been paid for, but that doesn't matter to you, because you've already been paid and if they've stopped caring about your project since then, so what.<br/><br/>This isn't such a good choice for companies planning to upscale their operation afterwards, but if you're not planning to maintain an inventory yourself anyway, and your project's not taking in thousands of preorders, then you should have no reason whatsoever to get yourself involved in the printing and fulfillment of the preorder, either. For a first-timer with no long-term ambitions as a publishing house all that stuff might be interesting, but more likely than not also a hellish bother that you'll come to regret. The less you need to worry about how to ship that single order to Czechoslovakia through the bubblewrap embargo, the better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432539/#Comment_432539" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T13:29:44+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  1:29PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't get it.

He's quoted me a very affordable rate because he loves the project, but it's not a bill I can afford to pay out of pocket. I know DW products tend to by illustration-light, and for good reason, but my conception of this particular project involves a lot of black and white drawings for a sort of an old-school module/zine feel. <br/><br/>But PoD is just an option I'm investigating. My original idea was to print digital or offset and fulfill the orders myself, but PoD seems like it offers a lot of convenience. The final form of the kickstarter will reflect whatever decision I make in regards to printing, but at a bare minimum it will be set up to cover the cost of the illustration work.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432560/#Comment_432560" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T15:02:31+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  3:02PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, with either Lulu or DriveThruRPG you can buy copies the same way you buy proofs and just ship them to your kickstarter backers.<br/><br/>The main advantage here is that, with Lulu at least, you get a fairly decent rate for shipping anywhere in the world, and you don't have to ship it to yourself and then pack and mail everything yourself.<br/><br/>The downsides are that you don't get bulk discount on printing*, you can't catch printing mistakes if there are any, and you still have to manually mail everything even if only digitally.<br/><br/>*DriveThruRPG/Lightning Source has a small discount on bulk orders, but you have to mail them all to the same place, so it's not actually helpful in this instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada" title="Coalhada"><img alt="Coalhada" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Coalhada">Coalhada</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432571/#Comment_432571" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T18:20:45+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  6:20PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I don't get it.

In addition to art, there are the costs of writing, editing, and layout- even if you're doing some of that work yourself, your time still has value. Crowdfunding is also a good way to gauge audience interest- there's no point writing and publishing a book that won't make any sales, even through print-on-demand.\n<blockquote>do you have a list of fulfillment partners? I've looked at FulfillRite and gotten a quote, but wondering if there are other places you know off hand.</blockquote>\nHonestly I haven't looked at any of the professional fulfillment companies- we've had the good fortune to make arrangements with companies we're already working with - Indie Press Revolution, our FLGS Atomic Empire, and our distributor Alliance. Even our occasional shirt sales are fulfilled by the artist who prints them for us.<br/><br/>In my experience, you can expect that fulfillment- that is, the job of taking your book off of a shelf, packaging it for shipment, and mailing it out- will cost you about $2-3 in labor and materials per package. Shipping is on top of that, of course.

I'm asking because I haven't seen this tack tried too often yet - the only one I can remember is Jim Raggi sort of flirting with this once, and that's hardly representative; there's like a zillion other reasons why that particular project might have done better or worse than some other project out there. I personally haven't seen this approach in use nearly often enough to have decided that it's a dead end.<br/><br/>(Meanwhile I've certainly seen crowdfunders burn out or mess up on a grand scale when they try to do a centralized print run with their own fulfillment. I would agree with anybody saying that it's not <i>that</i> difficult to know in advance what your USA-to-Europe postage will look like, but apparently we have new publishers stumble on these kinds of details every year, sometimes to such a degree that they end up blowing their entire profit margin on covering their logistical foibles.)<br/><br/>It should be noted that rationally there is no difference whatsoever between "pay me X money and I'll send you a book", and "pay me Y money, pay this other guy Z money, and they'll send you a book", except for the slight extra bother of having to pay in two smaller installments instead of a bigger one. This can actually be a feature in that a separated approach makes it possible for the customer to first check out a pdf, and then only pay to have it printed if they decide that they actually want to have this book on paper as well. Could also give more individualized options for where to print, what kind of paper, etc. once you've separated the issue of paying the creator from the issue of paying for paper, ink, book-binding and shipping.<br/><br/>Of course people aren't too rational, so that alone doesn't prove anything, except perhaps that we might expect this kind of separation between content and form to become more common over time, as obsessions over material products lessen in the customer base in favour of digital thinking and distributed production.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432597/#Comment_432597" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-14T07:25:40+00:00" title="May 14, 2014  7:25AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2014 7:28AM by kksimons.">edited May 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't mean to say it isn't a good option, just that many people are used to the idea of getting a product from the kickstarter and that it is included in the pledge price. Most kickstarters that go the PoD route though have a tier you pledge at, and then you get the book at cost so have to pay again later for shipping and such. Which, at least to me, as a backer on kickstarter, is simply not something I want to deal with. I'd rather pay more and know I'm getting a book and how much it'll cost than pay for the ability to get a book cheaper later, at a relatively unknown price. <br/><br/>To me it kind of feels like the creator is too lazy or unsure of themselves to actually make and deliver a product. Not to mention you have to spend a lot more to get the same quality you do via PoD compared to an traditional run, so I know I'm going to end up with a book I'm not all that happy with most of the time. More than that, since there's a base level to pledge at (that usually involves having to get the PDF) you end up paying more for a book than you normally would - again, I realize it's a kickstarter and making the book happen is the goal, just a taste thing and I'm poor. And that said, I do understand that with a limited audience and only wanting to do a very limited run, it's probably best to go PoD - but I'd still make it so that everything was included in the pledge price, it really isn't a hard thing to do. If you can't logistics of a kickstarter, don't run one, or get help.<br/><br/>I can only think of one really successful kickstarter for a book-at-cost type of kickstarter and that's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/937759598/lords-of-gossamer-and-shadow-diceless-role-playing" rel="nofollow">Lords of Gassomer and Shadow</a>. Though there may be more, I can only go on personal experience here. Not to mention there's no way I can say with absolute certainty that it would have done better doing a traditional print run and doing their own fulfillment, but I believe they would have - if only because it's a more comfortable and simple option that requires nothing from the backer aside from a single pledge through kickstarter.<br/><br/>An interesting comparison going on as well that might be worth following is Nova Praxis, a rare case of a second kickstarter for the same product under a different system. The first kickstarter was for Fate, second one is for Savage Worlds. First one gets you a book, second one gets you a copy at cost. There are obviously a ton of other variable at work too - how many people who are interested in it didn't buy it because of the system, when they launched, initial goals, the fact that it's well known and reviewed now, etc. Still, on the first day for the first kickstarter they made <a href="https://www.kicktraq.com/projects/804836187/nova-praxis-a-transhuman-sci-fi-fate-role-playing/#chart-daily" rel="nofollow">$3,525</a> (get a book).

In addition to art, there are the costs of writing, editing, and layout- even if you're doing some of that work yourself, your time still has value.</blockquote>\nMy thought is that if you don't have the funds then perhaps you should lower your own goals. I don't have exact numbers, but offset printing cost around $4 per book (~250 pages) where PoD cost more than twice that amount (Lulu). It's so much more expensive that I feel it's ripping the funders off. Even with double shipping cost for the offset print, I can hardly believe that it's enough to cover the extra cost for the printing with PoD.<br/><br/>With my first published game, that I sold with PoD, I got around $1000 in revenue that I spent on pictures for my next game. Successful Kickstarter projects lands around $1000-$1500. $1000 for twelve pictures is extremely cheap. You can only get more money if you make yourself a name first. The FATE Core was successful only because it came free at first. It took several years to gain that kind of momentum.<br/><br/>There is also a catch 22 with Kickstarter projects. In order to be inviting, you need to have pictures but to have pictures you got to have money. I would suggest to instead look at stock art instead of having custom made art. You can also use art for free if the artists died 75 years ago, and the following years will open up a lot of art, because of the WWII that started 75 years ago.

But hey, I can't draw for shit and I'm broke off my ass, so I do what works for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432866/#Comment_432866" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-20T10:04:16+00:00" title="May 20, 2014 10:04AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just received my copies of Lair of the Unknown, Island of Fire Mountain, and Hero Kids from DriveThruRPG. They look better than I expected! The only thing that seemed less than ideal was the way white type knocks out of the colored background on the covers -- not as crisp as one might hope, and likely the result of whatever color printing process Lightning Source uses. All in all, I would be fine with offering a PoD book through DriveThruRPG.<br/><br/>I have decided to go with non-PoD digital printing for the copies I'm going to offer backers of the kickstarter, and then put it up on DriveThruRPG after that.<br/><br/>Thank everyone for the feedback!<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes" title="Jason_Lutes"><img alt="Jason_Lutes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Lutes">Jason_Lutes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433369/#Comment_433369" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-04T08:58:45+00:00" title="June  4, 2014  8:58AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1735046512/servants-of-the-cinder-queen" rel="nofollow">I pulled the trigger</a>.
