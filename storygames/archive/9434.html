The crazy inside their characters, that is.  Similarly, I don't think anyone would complain if you described them as having a really warm reaction to someone while they were under a charm spell in D&amp;D.  In both cases the character does not have full control of his feelings and reactions for reasons that make sense within the fiction.  If there was no in-fiction reason for your control over their characters' inner life, they would be upset.<br/><br/>One exception to this is mind control - typically when the GM mind controls your character and proceeds to determine your actions, it sucks.  But it sucks for a different reason. Your character has been turned into an npc who exists to provide opposition for other players while you have nothing to do.  When you're going crazy, the point is still to creep you out, or to amuse you with the experience of insanity, or whatever.  So I think one limit is that taking control of a character's inner life has to be for purposes that are at some level geared towards that character's player.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209073">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209073/#Comment_209073" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T08:00:23+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  8:00AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As far as I'm concerned :<br/><br/><i>Player: I make a chalk mark on the wall.<br/>GM*: OK.

To the extent that it's not redeemable, it may be less satisfying.

I'm not a big fan, but it seems to me the only reason to even play in the Mythos is to embrace the surreal and decent into madness.

That would seem to defeat the whole purpose of playing Cthulhu...and likewise other games like Unknown Armies, or Over the Edge with the wierd cranked up to 11.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham, you phrase the above as "I could get away with".  If I were playing in your game the proper phrase would be "I'd be expected to".  If you weren't doing that sort of thing, I'd say "dude...why are you wasting my time, I thought we were playing Cthulhu...".

I've also seen this occur when the rest of the group has been together for some time.  There might be trust in the GM knowing best.  I've seen groups accept it when there isn't much buy-in to the game to begin with, and the players aren't particularly attached to their characters. <br/><br/>The limits really seem to depend on the makeup of the group.

If, on the other hand, the train just steamed through the night and ended up stopping at the Lincolnshire platform, with nothing interesting in Lincolnshire, I suspect the player would be perturbed.  Or to go in-theme about it, if the train just kept going, forever steaming after the dawnlit horizon and never quite catching it, the player would be annoyed that he's trapped on that strange train.  In both these cases, you the Keeper have failed to live up to the implied promise of something interesting happening next.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209142">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209142/#Comment_209142" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T14:43:47+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  2:43PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2009 2:45PM by Joe Murphy.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>I didn't want anyone borrowing that lever for any reason.</blockquote>\nEven in a Cthulhu game?  I'm not a big fan, but it seems to me the only reason to even play in the Mythos is to embrace the surreal and decent into madness.  And that embracing would seem to have as a prerequisite the fundamental understanding that the "lever" is there for the GM to manipulate without your approval (other than the initial buy in needed to play).<br/><br/>My group has alternated between indie games, board games, and trad games recently. I expected to get more out of the trad games, knowing what I do about indie stuff. But they've felt much more like the _40 minutes of fun in 4 hours_ I'd had back in the 80s and 90s. I don't think we've used these new techniques (bangs or scene framing or whatever) effectively.<br/><br/>Partially, I think that's because I'm so used to actively participating in world-building and scene-setting, and disengaging from that leaves me a bit bored. I've a lot less to do. Sitting there, 'being in character' doesn't keep my mind busy.<br/><br/>So yeah. I still want that lever.<br/><br/>Now, if I'd played a game that was rreally sharp, that either pushed immersion, or used some indie techniques, or avoided pixelbitching, and had a whole group dedicated to a certain kind of experience, and a GM that pushed <i>harder </i> than I'd had back in the 90s, I think I could enjoy that. I'd want a lot of feedback that these odd experiences were going somewhere. I'd want to feel the GM's sympathy for my character, too. Having played with Graham before, I think he'd be good at this. I think I'd be good at this. But as it's happened, I've had some very recent trad experiences that missed the mark.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209145/#Comment_209145" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T14:56:50+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  2:56PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno...I've provided some emotional framing of scenes since forever and none of my players have ever complained about fiat or railroading or whatever.

Sometimes, as Paul says, it's merely "context for the scene," but in Graham's case the players accept the narration because it allows for a break between objective perception ("you see you've drawn"; "you feel comfortable") and the character/player's logical reactions.  Compare: "you decided to drawn a strange symbol" and "you feel comfortable, therefore you don't do anything."  As it stands, there is a clear sense convey by the transgression of ordinary boundaries of narration that something strange is going on here.  The player could, for instance, get up and try to get off the train while still feeling comfortable--in doing so, it would emphasize the difference between logical action and emotional feeling.  So long as there is the opportunity to reflect on the difference between this situation and normality, these sorts of episodes aren't necessarily deprotagonizing, because it draws attention to the situation and gives the player a chance to address it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209155/#Comment_209155" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T16:08:48+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  4:08PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2009 4:09PM by John_Harper.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I sometimes like to do this by framing the elements as questions:<br/><br/><i>Player: I make a chalk mark on the wall.<br/>GM: OK.

It's difficult to discuss this sort of thing, because context is so important. Are those GM declarations implying some sort of statement about the character, or are they essentially meaningless?<br/><br/>Furthermore, it depends a lot on the characterization of the PC in question. A quick but cheesy example would be if the player was portraying a badass character, and the GM declares, "At the sound of the drums in the distance, you pee your pants." The player would probably feel the GM overstepped their bounds, since the declaration ran counter to the player's previous characterization. However, if the GM said something like, "At the sounds of distant drums, a determination to see the end of the journey rises inside you," the player probably wouldn't care, since that sort of thing seems consistent with the whole badass thing.<br/><br/>Following me?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209159/#Comment_209159" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T16:49:46+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  4:49PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With folks I've played with a lot, whom I have a good rapport with, I totally tend to do like Harper says, a cross between fishing/MWtrick and hard narration.

He even crawled on his knees across the room, telling her how much he loved her, how glad he was to have her back, how he never wanted her to leave again.

I mean, you, the player, know your character drew it, if you investigate the GM will tell you you drew it, and there's film of you drawing it, and your friends all say you drew it, so what's the point of leaving out "you've drawn" in that sentence if your character really did draw it? Not sarcasm, I really want to know.</blockquote>\nBecause as a player, the fact that the GM doesn't tell me that my character drew it leaves me some space for interpretation. Maybe my character don't even want to talk about it, maybe he refuses to acknowledged he did it, whatever... By saying "you did this" you close the door to any other interpretation. This is strictly my point of view of course, some people won't see this as limiting as I do.<br/><br/>I'll use another example, in a Deadlands game one of the character was taken over by his manitou ("the thing that will make you do bad things" if you don't know what I'm talking about). <br/><br/>GM : "<i>you wake up in a house, you find the corpses of five people, two adults and three kids</i>" <br/>Player : "<i>Uuh, ok, how many bullets are left in my colt ?</i>"<br/>GM : "<i>One</i>"<br/><br/>The player decided that his character didn't feel like he did it and decided he was framed. This would have been harder for him to pull out if I just said : "<i>you've just killed five people and feel bad about it</i>".<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, in a Cthulhu game, yes, I know that my character will become insane but <i>suspecting</i> that you're becoming insane and flatly <i>knowing</i> it are two different things (once again, that's my opinion, YMMV).<br/><br/>In the Call of Cthulhu scenario "<i>The Truth shall set you free</i>" (from <i>Unseen Masters</i>) if you tell, at any moment, what the character is feeling or what he does you just ruin the whole plot which is "you're going insane and you don't even know it".<br/><br/>So, to avoid any threadjacking :<br/><br/><i>So, under various circumstances, I can dictate characters' actions and mental states. I can even overrule what the player wants the character to do or feel. But there must be limits to this, right? What are the limits?</i><br/><br/>The only limit I see is the control you have should leave some room for the player to play with like John Harper did (or in my above example for Deadlands). Ignorance is an important tool in any horror story, giving facts that don't leave room to interpretation may be counterproductive in a horror game. But once again YMMV.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_209184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209184/#Comment_209184" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T19:26:42+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  7:26PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, Alexandre, would you say the problem is not that the GM took control of your character, but that when he did so he filled in too many of the details too specifically?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_209188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/209188/#Comment_209188" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-26T21:18:59+00:00" title="May 26, 2009  9:18PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One more thought:<br/><br/>In some genres and some games, an unreliable witness creates seriously kickass play.

When a player is overcome by madness another player, one who isn't involved in the scene, will describe how it overtakes him.<br/><br/>To get back on subject, though.  I'm really enjoying reading all of this.  It's not Cthulhu but I'm struggling a bit running a WoD game right now, and this has given me a lot of ideas.  I'd like to work in more madness, and I especially want to work on "fishing" techniques to do some of it.  I think in the past when I've tried to do so, I may have done it too bluntly, resulting in my friends sometimes reacting with "Aren't YOU supposed to tell ME what happens?"  I may have to try it with a softer touch, like John suggested.<br/><br/>So that, said, I think any of the stuff Graham proposed in the initial post would fly with my friends.
