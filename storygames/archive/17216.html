One of them is to disclaim decision-making. "I dunno. What do you know?" or "I don't know. Where or who might you have heard something about Nbeke from?"<br/><br/>But remember, if they're looking at you expecting you to say something... make a move. Announce future badness is, as always, a good all-purpose one: "Nbeke's a badass, and his gang is crazily well-armed. Nobody knows where he gets all those guns. Does a lot of trade with slavers, too, and if you don't like that you're going to have problems with him." If they're going <i>looking</i> for information... make them buy? "Rolfball looks at you, gleam in his eye. 'Ooooh, Nbeke, eh? That'll cost ya! Man enjoys his <i>privacy</i>, yaknowwhati'msayin?'" Tell them the possible consequences and ask, maybe. "Tum Tum's mind has never been the same since that trip up North, but he's still the most traveled out of anyone in the hardhold. Want to ask him, maybe?"<br/><br/>You absolutely CAN make a custom move for "see if you know shit" but you don't really have to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390511/#Comment_390511" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T04:18:27+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  4:18AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooooo, Ben.

Thing to remember about AW and derivatives, if there's obviously no move for it, you can still do it, but you don't roll dice for it. In case of "figure something out", that's passive, and AW is kinda not about being passive, so there's no move for it. If you, the player, can't figure it out with the info you have, maybe you need more info (so maybe you need to Seize it by Force, or Barter for it, or something). Or you can always say Fuck It, open your mind to the psychic maelstrom, and ask it to tell you.<br/><br/>If the MC is super nice and want to hand you stuff on a silver platter, they could just tell you, of course.

If the player really wants to roll the dice, I might suggest - or nominate someone else to suggest, or encourage brainstorming on - rewrites of the fiction to work better in the context of the actual move.<br/><br/>For example, the typical:<br/><br/>"I shoot him in the shin."<br/>"Oh really? Are you attempting to <i>Seize something by Force</i>, or what?"<br/>"Um, I just really want to shoot him in the shin. And, you know, deal some harm or whatever."<br/>"Oh, but you'll deal harm anyway. Are you trying to perhaps <i>Seize his Mobility by Force</i>?"<br/>"Sure, that sounds right, let's do that."<br/><br/>though I might've just said:<br/><br/>"Okay, you shoot him in the leg. He crumples to the ground, screaming and bleeding, clutching at the wound."<br/><br/>or, if I was a bastard:<br/><br/>"From this distance?? Without a scope or laser sight or anything?? Okay, you shoot and miss his shin. The bullet pings off the metal floor next to him and he turns around, gun lodged at his hip, automatic fire spraying everywhere. What do you do?" though I should've probably <i>Given the Possible Consequences and Asked</i> first.<br/><br/>I prefer if the player had said something like "I'm going to take control of that guard post he's hanging out in, by taking him out at a reasonable distance before he notices me, then move in quickly - but I still want him alive, so I'm going to take aim at his legs while I'm approaching." I would've called for an <i>Act Under Fire</i> to move up close enough and then a <i>Seize by Force</i> with the guard post as the subject and its guard as the obstacle. Much cleaner than rewriting fiction to fit the mechanics, IMHO.<br/><br/>The approach of degrading to an appropriate stat is essentially writing a custom move on the fly, which is cool too. In those situations, I usually make up a barebones move that'll do the job, then for a subsequent session I name it, flesh it out, and make it more interesting. That avoids the problem of inconsistent rulings in similar situations, and give us a better toolbox for our ongoing games.<br/><br/>Not-at-all saying you're doing it wrong, but it's not the way I prefer to do it. To me, the lack of certain moves (like, there's no "hack &amp; slash" in AW and there's no "seize by force" in DW - which makes for very different games) is sometimes even more telling than the presence of others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390564/#Comment_390564" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T13:12:35+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  1:12PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2012 2:36PM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Many good examples have already been given, but I would also add that the Workshop rules actually provide a much better framework for serious 'figure something out' issues than Open Your Brain. OYB can work for that too, but I see it as more useful for a 'I don't know what to do next' or 'I feel like something is going on here but I dunno what' situation. <br/><br/>I mean, the Workshop rules allow the MC to provide straightforward exposition on a topic of interest -- once the PC has met all the necessary conditions, of course -- whereas if your Open Your Brain responses are starting to feel like fully-comprehensible exposition, that's generally a warning sign that your Maelstrom-fiction might need some barfing up. <br/><br/>Open Your Brain is a request to the MC that they show you more of the mystery/badness/weirdness than you may have previously had access to, or provide a new perspective on things you have already encountered; the Workshop rules provide a way for the MC to actually explain that shit. After all, sometimes there are things PCs want to know or problems they want to solve that can't be resolved in a single burst of visionary insight.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390580/#Comment_390580" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T14:16:00+00:00" title="September 17, 2012  2:16PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I personally don't like degrading to Defy Danger or the base WoD move of roll+stat in AW.

If there's no PC move for it, and there's no custom move for it, then the MC says what happens, using her agenda and principles and moves. This is a feature, not a bug. You don't have to roll dice for it to matter. Don't force dice rolls in AW where they don't need to exist.<br/><br/>(But, like Jason said: the stakes are fairly low. If you do fall back on a stat roll in a pinch, it will work fine and not crash the game or anything.)<br/><br/>The feel and texture of DW is differefent from AW. Start importing moves across the games and you will smooth out the peaks and valleys and make them more and more alike. Sometimes this is what you want, but do it with intention, not because you just feel like rolling for something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390619/#Comment_390619" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-17T23:48:28+00:00" title="September 17, 2012 11:48PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2012 11:48PM by Johnstone.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>Hey, are you guys saying I'm wrong?

AW provides this language for talking about play, specifically for talking about GM-backed sandbox play (which is mostly what people used the language to talk about, for the most part, though there's been hints of other play style), but there can still be dramatic differences in how the GM is meant to approach different games and how players interact with the moves. And those differences are part of what makes it worthwhile, in my opinion, to play all these games and look at how different hacks handle similar issues in different ways. The fact that things as different as Murderous Ghosts and Sagas of the Icelanders are both AW hacks demonstrates that there's a lot of variety contained in these games and even more unexplored potential as people begin to stretch the language. <br/><br/>I mean, part of what I think happened with Murderous Ghosts is that Vincent is already much more proficient in using the language to do different things than those of us who later began learning to speak, read, and write it. By the time he finished AW, he pretty much had it down for talking about AW-like stuff and so has already started using it to talk about things that are pretty different from AW. Folks are catching up, but obviously he's had a fair headstart. Many of the apples are falling reasonably close to the tree right now, but there are still significant differences and my expectation is that different AW-inspired games will only become more dissimilar over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390670/#Comment_390670" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-18T09:45:22+00:00" title="September 18, 2012  9:45AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 18, 2012 9:46AM by skinnyghost.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>Hey, are you guys saying I'm wrong?
