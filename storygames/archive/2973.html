Etc. <br/><br/>When was the last time any of your characters had a pet? Was it a color item? A mechanical advantage?

One such character was statted up but never played, a noblewoman and avid huntress who kept a half-wolf dog. The idea was that she'd use the dog for hunting and tracking, sic it on the uppity, etc. This was in Fate 2.0 so the dog was an Aspect and Personal Extra, with its own Aspects and Skills. If I redid the character in Fate 3.0 the dog would likely be an Aspect and Stunt.<br/><br/>I think system plays a part when it comes to characters having pets. 7th Sea, for instance, had hardly any mechanical support for pets. Just about the only animal rules I can think of are spiders for Fate Witches in the Vodacce book. Fate has Aspects and Stunts which encourage all sorts of PC extras, including pets. And of course, the title of the thread had me immediately thinking of Earthdawn with its Beastmaster class.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67623/#Comment_67623" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T13:39:32+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  1:39PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Russell Collins</cite><br/>When was the last time any of your characters had a pet?

What sort of interaction would you be hoping for?<br/><br/>Although I can't say the rules drive it forward Elfquest has a pretty strong wolf/Elf relationship, especially our campaign where the whole pack slept in a heap.  Our wolves were our friends and we emulated them in our interactions with one another.<br/><br/>I guess to answer the question we need a focus.  Any ideas on what sorts of goals we'd have in such a game?  What do we wish convey?  Do we want to explore what sort of comfort and comaradere we gain from having pets?  Does size and personal interests come into scope?  Are you a cat person or a alpaca person or a psuedodragon person?<br/><br/>Further thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_67637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67637/#Comment_67637" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T14:52:57+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  2:52PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Russell Collins</cite><br/>When was the last time any of your characters had a pet? </blockquote>\nIn one game I play another PC's magical pet, but I don't think that's what you're looking for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_67643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/67643/#Comment_67643" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-08T15:32:37+00:00" title="May  8, 2007  3:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always name my horse in <em>Dogs</em>, and they often become rather important character foils to my own PC.
