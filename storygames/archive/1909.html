<div class="Message">
                    I recently pitched a two-week Dungeons &amp; Savages game to our gaming club. D&amp;S is Savage Worlds programmed to do niche-protectionist slay-for-pay fantasy. The pitch response was gratifyingly and alarmingly huge. Ordinarily I like to keep my player group to 3 or 4, but for this one I've got eight. These are all lovely people and I don't want to start picking winners and losers, and it's only a two week game anyway, so I said, sure, let's embrace Geek Social Falacies #1 and #5 and just go for it.<br/>
<br/>
So, it's time to experiment with how to run a big con-type short-shot game. Since it's Savage Worlds, it will be mostly about kicking ass, but I want a bit of player-engaged story on top of that, so it's not just me telling them what they need to care about.<br/>
<br/>
The SGA gamers are used to short-shots and appear tolerant of being railroaded through a scenario as long as the trappings are interesting to them.  Some of them are pretty passive, and some of them are more vocal leadership types -- about a 50/50 split this way. They're all housebroken adults who can play well with others and who are relaxed and fun. There's joking and laughter, both on-and-off topic. The space is pretty excellent, we have a whole basement to ourselves. No one has to shout over a busy gaming store or food court crowd.<br/>
<br/>
I think the most energy I've ever seen at their table was during a Necessary Evil game (in which supervillains must save the world after an alien invasion kills all the heroes). Our villain team kitbashed a burrowing submarine for an assault on an alien base. We were humming the A-Team theme and describing the welds our characters were making. It was a hoot.<br/>
<br/>
So, my starting points for the scenario design go like this (and if you're an SGA person and you're reading past this sentence, then I hope you are absolutely burning with shame right now.)<br/>
<br/>
1. I love Bangs. It should start with a Bang -- the group should be forced to make a meaningful choice. (a group Bang, I guess you'd call it.)<br/>
<br/>
2. And, somewhat contradictorily, it needs to be hurried along. With so many players, there could be analysis paralysis, so I think I'm gonna be a bastard about getting people to make decisions and sticking with them. We should avoid decisions that require a consensus.<br/>
<br/>
3. It should have a cliffhanger at the end of the first session, to bring everyone back for session II.<br/>
<br/>
4. The biggest flaw of con games from my POV is the impersonal stakes. The GM tells you something is important, and you just have to take their word and deal with it. I think the two-session structure can be used to fix this: session one is the one where the players screw something up, or are present when something gets screwed up, and session two is when they are responsible for fixing it. That, I think, will make the stakes less abstract.<br/>
<br/>
5. The game should play to Savage Worlds' strengths. I want Braveheart and Gladiator-scale battles. I want crowds of figures and buckets of dice and Stalingrad-level casualties. To lessen the load on me somewhat, I've asked some people about co-GMing it to take some of the massive figure and rules-question load off me, and we'll see how that turns out.<br/>
<br/>
6. I need to know my tabletop settings in advance so I can print out some big versions of them at Kinko's. I like the village map from the T1-Village of Hommlet and the abbey map from X4-Master of the Desert Nomads, so those are my two tabletop settings.<br/>
<br/>
7. I'd like to somehow take advantage of the A-Team Montage factor.<br/>
<br/>
With all that stuff in mind, this is what I came up with: there's a village and an abbey. The abbey is quiet, reclusive, ancient, and difficult to approach. An Evil Baddie is secretly imprisoned there. The deal with the (non-fighty) monks of the abbey is that they throw all their worldly wealth into a pit. The Evil Baddie is imprisoned by this wealth -- the monks' vows of poverty and money sacrifice create a zone of honesty and sincerity through which the Evil Baddie cannot wreak his evil badness. But if that gold should be taken away....<br/>
<br/>
Right now, the local village demagogue has gotten wind of the monks' money pit and demon ties, so he's called up the militia and they're on their way to raid the place (with the public goal of destroying demons and apostates, and the private goal of making the demogogue and his toadies rich). The characters encounter the militia on the road, heading to destroy the place. They'll pick up this hook and run with it -- they're good about taking adventure hooks -- and the big question will be, what happens when they see the militia slaughtering the monks -- especially when there's all this treasure at stake?<br/>
<br/>
(Sudden thought -- the demogogue would be an excellent role for a co-GM to manage, because his objectives are simple: prevaricate about the real reasons for the assault, and then scoot around trying to find the treasure when it's underway.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess this situation isn't quite a bang, because there's a tiny introductory section where we meet the militia. But I like pushing the bang-point into the raid itself -- at that point we'll be in the part of the adventure where everyone gets their turn to act, so they won't have to negotiate a consensus on this stuff. There might be conflicting opinions about how to proceed and intraparty conflict. In a short game, I think that's fine, even if it comes to PvP swordplay. These guys are all adults and I'm not worried about anyone getting their feelings hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I'm anticipating the big evil dude will be released as part of this. That will be the Act 1 cliffhanger, and the second night of the game will be spent dealing with his release -- unless the characters prevent the militia from taking the gold, and don't take it themselves, in which case, I don't know what will happen. Maybe they'll become the guardians of the place themselves, and will have to ward off a siege from another opportunistic village? That might be good for an A-Team montage, especially if the monastery is well-stocked with building supplies.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought I had was if the party was split two ways on whether to slaughter or help the monks, maybe the demon co-opts the slaughters and the slaughterers have to fight the helpers in sesson II. That might be the ideal way to deal with a big group -- set them against each other!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's it. Any thoughts on this scenario? Anyone here pulled off a big-group short-duration game before, and have something to offer about how to do it right?<br/>

                            I think the co-GM idea is golden.  He can run the big baddie in the second session, maybe.                        </div>

                            What's SGA?<br/><br/>Also, I haven't seen a huge-scale game (outside of Luke's demos) since like GenCon some ten or so years ago: A local gaming group was running a concurrent 3-party game: One group all neutral, all evil and all good; about 8-12 people per group. <br/><br/>Some lessons I saw were; In huge groups, individual goals are cool but dividing the big group into "factions" (not necisserily at odds with each other; they may be working together but in friction with each other) works well.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Oh yeah, we had an 18-person bachelor party 1e D&amp;D game this past summer.  We structured it into two teams of 8 players that were loosely competing (the team that kiled more giants won some prize).  The two GMs did a lot of prep work, the adventures were totally linear (the Against the Giants series of modules) and all the cahracters were high level pre-gens.<br/><br/>At the end of the evening all the surviving characters met and fought together in an insano final battle.  It was tremendously fun, but quite a bit of work to set up.  Lessons learned - be well prepared, provide all the necessary materials for the players, have clear objectives for the group, start with solid action, and don't let up.                        </div>

                            Andy: SGA = Seattle Gamers Assemble.  (http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/SeattleGAMERS_ASSEMBLE/)  It's a meetup style group where people hook up for games, and it also sponsors Monday night short-shot games at a local gaming clubhouse.  The Monday night people are game for just about anything, so it's a great place to experiment.<br/>

                            Hey Johnzo,<br/><br/>Damn it, I wish I lived in Seattle...!  Hey, when I ran a con game of Ars Magica a few years back, I loaded each pre-gen PC with opinions about each of the other characters and about local features and personalities, sort of like the WW splat outlooks on other splats.  That really hooked and grounded the players from the word "go."  My favorite blurb was the young Lady on a low-born "Luke Skywalker" grog: "Cute, for a peasant.  Make his life miserable."  Boy, did the Lady's player go to town on that!  What you're doing is pre-loading a relationship map stuffed with potential bangs.<br/><br/>If you're letting the players generate their own characters, you might still consider having them do the same thing.  Have people chat a bit and introduce their characters, discuss concepts, etc.  Then ask everyone to write down in-character short blurbs about (a) specific impressions about each of the other characters ("Rowan looks like an asshat.  Don't listen to him."), (b) an iconic moment of character action (e.g., "I hack through a mass of screaming foes, sparing none.") and (c) religion ("All priests are corrupt sons of bitches, except the martyrs.").<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>Blake                        </div>

                            Blake!  Good to see you here, and congratuations on the Woofie win!  <br/><br/>(for those who don't know him, Blake is a very recent winner of the Writers of the Future contest.  Wherever there are asses to be kicked, Blake's mighty iron-shod boot cannot be far behind.)<br/><br/>Anyway. I've played in games with pre-loaded motivations / attitudes / personality-crunch.   It hasn't worked for me as a player -- what if the gamemaster gives me something that I'm just not jazzed about?   I don't know how the players feel about them, though.  I should ask them.<br/><br/>There is also a scaling problem with such things.  Doing a relationship matrix for eight characters is too much work for this lazy GM.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>Hmm... but maybe doing them for one or two characters each...Sudden thought: what about asking each player to designate one other character as their character's Rival and another character as their Comrade and then run a straight dungeon crawl with that being the story-input?  It'd be like High School Swim Team Dungeon, maybe.  But how to prevent the overriding concerns of the dungeon from overwhelming the rest of the stuff?  That's the thing -- I don't want input that's potentially irrelevant. <br/><br/>I do know that I want to have fidelity to the core conceits of D&amp;D.  Since the players responded so positively to the D&amp;Dish bill of goods I sold them, I think they're expecting monsters and treasure and slaughter.  The bangs I want to set off need to be as universal as possible for that kind of game.  "When to kill?" and "what to kill?" are the ones I've got so far and if anyone can suggest any others I would buy them a hot beverage.<br/><br/>So, the enumerated constraints:<br/><br/>1. Eight players.<br/>2. Two nights.<br/>3. D&amp;Dish fidelity<br/>4. A touch more story than "Hello Angels.  Go here, kill that, and Charlie gets 10%"  Put some meaningful decisions on the characters' shoulders.<br/><br/>These might be impossible constraints but it's fun to think about them.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>zo.                        </div>
