                    I'm planning on GM-ing for the First Time Ever in about a month or so, running The Mountain Witch.  I've got a good group together of people who are my friends as well as being by and large experienced gamers, so I'm not terribly worried that it will all fall flat and no one will have fun.  It'll probably be three short sessions, and I'm working on compiling a bunch of bangs and familiarizing myself with the rules and text.<br/><br/>So I guess this is kind of a twofold question.  First of all, if any of you have run The Mountain Witch, I'm trying to figure out what kind of handouts I should give the players.  There's probably one or two other copies of the book floating around in the group, but what kind of stuff is it helpful for people to have right in front of them during chargen and game play?<br/><br/>Secondly, and more generally, do you have any advice for a first-time GM, stuff that isn't necessarily obvious?                </div>

                            You should <i>totally </i>get in touch with Eric Provost, who is an accomplished Mountain Witch GM and quite good. <br/><br/>It sounds like you are on the right track.  Be prepared but not too prepared, since you must flow with the player's ingenuity and weird intentions - especially in tMW.  That's more than half the fun right there.<br/><br/>My biggest piece of advice for you is to remember that you need to have a good time, too.  So check in with yourself and with your friends to make sure that everyone - including you - is having a rocking time.  It's easy to get caught up in making sure the game runs smoothly, and that everyone else is rocking out.                        </div>

                            My experience with tMW is that you almost <i>can't</i> throw too much adversity at the ronin. Don't be afraid to push hard.                        </div>

<p>Hiya Kirsten,</p>
<p>I've run tMW maybe a half dozen times, and I dig it more and more every time I play it.</p>
<p>This is what I suggest for handouts/prep material;</p>
<ol>
<li>See if you can find some tokens for trust points.  A different color for each player, and maybe 20-30 of each color.  </li>
<li>Sheets of Japanese or Japanese-flavored names.  Have a couple sheets to pass around for the players to create their characters.  Keep a seperate sheet with totally different names for yourself.</li>
<li>The character sheets that have all the dice-rolling mechanisms spelled out on them are very handy.</li>
<li>Prep a handful or two of NPCs/monsters that want things that you're pretty sure the PCs won't want to give up.  A spider-monster that wants to steal all the clothes off their backs is way more fun than yet another monster that wants them all dead.  (my personal favourite are the two Actors who want to put on a show for the ronin.  What they won't reveal is that their play takes 7 years to complete... and it's so good that no one will notice the time passing.)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is my advice specific to GMing tMW;</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that everyone is very familiar with all of the Fates and has a good idea of what they could do with each and every one of them <em>before</em> you deal them out.  This way you can head-off that situation where a player is totally stumped by what they're supposed to do with their card.</li>
<li>Some players have trouble authoring three special abilities for their characters.  I've recently explained the Abilities thing to convention players like so:  Every character automatically has one important skill; Do Samaurai Stuff.  Now, name three abilities or skills that your character has that we wouldn't normally assume that a samaurai could do.</li>
<li>Early in the game use the 'fishing technique' a lot.  Stuff like; "You're in a graveyard, and your character recognizes the name on one of the headstones.  It was someone important to you.  Who was it?"</li>
<li>Later in the game, use the material that your players provided for you.  Build on it.  Use it to mess with them.  That was someone's brother buried in that graveyard?  Awesome.  Now try to figure out who was romantically involved with the brother, who betrayed him, who put a knife in his back, etc.  </li>
<li>Don't forget that all the material that the players give you via the fishing technique and through their Fates becomes yours to play with.  Use that to connect people in the most horrible ways.  A character suddenly reveals that she's really at the castle to meet up with her long lost lover and captive to the witch?  Great!  Now make that long lost lover the guy who betrayed, killed, and was romantically involved with the dead brother.  Watch the sparks fly when that information is revealed.</li>
<li>Duels can drag on if you let them.  Don't let them.  Interpret every duel where the PCs want to kill each other as death ASAP, even if the dice are only 1 or 2 points removed.  Be clear with your players that they should be prepared to interpret duels that way.  The two players who are constantly picking up their dice to duel over and over again will probably be having a blast.  Everyone else waiting for them to resolve it will be getting bored.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's my general GMing-for-the-first-time advice;</p>
<p>Don't sweat it and have a great time!  Seriously.  My wife Lisa recently started GMing after decades of playing.  She was crazy nervous, but turned out to be totally awesome at it.  You will be too.</p>
<p>-Eric</p>

                            I've bought TMW from IndiePressRevolution but not read it (I've just hacked my way through Conspiracy of Shadows). I can't really comment on TMW specific guidance and my way of GMing may not be useful to you...so I'll comment from the POV of a Chinese game I ran for a bit<br/><br/>But the first thing I do is write down a heap of names for people, places, weapons, demons. Next, I think about how the players meet and the first two sessions. The first one I prefer to be In Media Res and the second one is the start of "How they meet", set before the first session. If you try to just be one session ahead, you should have enugh material. Keep a notebook handy as the players will feed you ideas during the game.<br/><br/>I started GMing again after a 2 year hiatus....I know how you feel.                        </div>

                            I would make it clear to the players that spooning their Dark Fates into the story is what makes the game <i>whirr</i>. We're finishing up our game next week (i'm playing), and it's been good fun but I find myself still pretty much in the dark about 2 of the other 3 players' motivations. This is a shame as it makes it harder to weave our stories together, both because I don't know what to shoot for - no obvious flags hanging to show where they want to go - and because of the worry of stepping on their toes. <br/><br/>I would say to the players that although you don't want to reveal everything all from the get-go (you need secrets for the Trust mechanics to shine), you can show quite a lot of your hand and still have people guessing - and as an extension of this, if you limit yourself to subtle clues these can entirely pass over the other players. In our game, one of the characters kept lagging behind the group, staring meaningfully at the moon or having wry moments of understanding at various  moments; I'm sure this was working for the player in expressing his character, but I didn't get anything I could sink my teeth into (on the plus side, our characters have developed a nice leadership struggle totally orthogonal to the dark fates).                        </div>
