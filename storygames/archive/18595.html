I've really liked everything I've gotten my hands on so far, it's really interesting to see the design scene over there producing so many designs with SG-friendly elements.<br/><br/><b>Maid</b><br/><br/>I haven't really put this one through its paces, honestly; I played it once and it was a decently fun outing, but I don't do a lot of slapstick gaming.  It was an interesting read though, and if nothing else I got my money's worth when I used the random events table <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/280392#Comment_280392" rel="nofollow">to plot out a couple sessions of Nobilis.</a><br/><br/><b>Tenra Bansho Zero</b><br/><br/>Now this one, this is everything I could have hoped for, really.  I've run Tenra a few times now, mostly one-shots, but the last couple weeks have been an ongoing game where the players ended up running a salvage town hauling technomagic junk out of the Soratsuzumi Sea.  Last session had a completely awesome moment from a new player's Bright Lotus monk stoically enduring police brutality for the sake of the peasant workers and oppressed oni, and eventually being granted formal supervision over that ward of the city.<br/><br/>Running it as an ongoing game has been interesting.  For one thing, I haven't seen that much Kiai spending yet.  We are kinda new to the game (only about half of us have even read the book), and the somewhat slice-of-lifey nature of the campaign (see below) means there hasn't been a whole lot of die-rolling per scene, but I do wonder if they're stocking it up for XP purposes.  I think the one-shotty nature of the default game might loosen people up from undue attachment to their characters and deferring "awesome now" for "awesome later".<br/><br/>I also have been a little loose about the recommended GM structure.  The group has been doing a lot of one-shots and was hankering for an ongoing setting they could really invest in, which is a little in conflict with Tenra's default inclinations to watch everything burn in the fires of cathartic drama.  So instead of putting together an NPC-centric outline and seeing how the players mess with it, I've basically spent the last few sessions just introducing significant supporting/opposing cast and seeing where things go.  Even without much pre-planning, the Emotion Matrix usually provides an immediate exciting context and things go off like a bang (and gave me context for assigning compelling Destinies); the ex-shinobi chief of police took an immediate dislike to the head of a merchant family and made tossing him in jail his number one priority, and the martial-artist assistant governor's meeting with the city's resident Northern Shinto priest basically immediately turned into the Alita/Nova karmic frenemies thing from Battle Angel, which was pretty much the best possible scenario since Tenra got me rereading it anyway... and last session she ended up burning down the entire shrine with him in it, so I guess we can't escape our drama karma for long.<br/><br/>Anyway, we're putting it on hiatus for a bit to mess around with Fate Core, so I'm running one more session that will be run in a more properly Tenra fashion.<br/><br/><b>Golden Sky Stories</b><br/><br/>Just finished reading the Kickstarter pre-release.  This will be challenging to run, I'd rather play first, but I'm likely to be the only one who's read it in my group for the foreseeable future.  I did <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/411359#Comment_411359" rel="nofollow">run the Free RPG Day quickstart</a>, and it seemed to go well, but I still didn't feel like I had an adequate grasp of the intended mood.  Perhaps in future I will judo my cynicism by inserting things that bug me RL into the setting and seeing what soothing tools of gentleness the players bring to bear.<br/><br/><b>Double Cross</b><br/><br/>I've just about finished reading this one.  It's pretty cool!  I've been interested in DX for a couple years, and the stealth release on Amazon was a fun surprise, though maybe if the translation project had been less closed the book would have been better copy edited.  As is, it is absolutely riddled with typos, all through the prose and in the power mechanics, which is especially bad because the game very much encourages system mastery and synergistic power usage a la Exalted or D&amp;D4 (and since there's no PDF version, I am lacking an easy way to print out and transcribe the power descriptions for easy reference).  <br/><br/>All that said, there are a lot of cool and smart things in this book.  I dig the seemingly Tenra-inspired fast-play design a lot; viral Encroachment feels like a sideways take on the Karma-Asura cycle, with Meikyo bonus built-in for everyone. The powersets are all cool (and I love that the default powers for every PC include "resurrect from death" and "clear out the non-powered bystanders"), and I especially love the game's cultural omnivorousness.  <br/><br/>It's big beautiful mind-laser-shooting pulpiness the way I like it.  I'm probably going to run it soon, after the errata settles down.<br/><br/><b>Ryuutama</b><br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/336494#Comment_336494" rel="nofollow">Ran this a couple years back</a>, super excited for the finished version and wide release!  I really like the way it leverages classes and levels to make character creation super quick without locking character advancement into confining pre-defined niches or requiring system mastery to get the most out of it, and I dig the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/402409#Comment_402409" rel="nofollow">"dragon as anthropomorphic social contract and campaign diary"</a> thing too. <br/><br/><b>Shinobigami</b><br/><br/>Confirmed for English release, but still way out on the horizon as far as I know.  Looking forward to it though!<br/><br/>Anyone else played/run any of these yet?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417960/#Comment_417960" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-08T12:02:43+00:00" title="July  8, 2013 12:02PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>Anyone else played/run any of these yet?<br/>&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>(raises hand! ...but that's cheating)<br/><br/><b>DoubleCross</b>... indeed re typos. However, it's rather easy to teach people using nothing more than a set of pregen characters, and makes for a fulfilling one-shot/con game. Matt Sanchez and I were considering it a few months ago, kind of lamenting that it's not as suited for long campaign play as the Lois/Titus mechanic means that you're burning your relationships to ashes almost every session. Which means that its weakness for long campaign play is 100% a strength for short term/one-shot play, and in that it really does shine!<br/><br/><b>Ryuutama</b> is going to be grand. Working with the author and original artist(s) to potentially do More Stuff (currently planned: More herbs/gathering; more art; and potentially a new scenario-generation system). Plus, there's all the additional French material for Jerome's French release that could later be brought back into English. I really can't contain my excitement enough.<br/><br/><b>Shinobigami</b> is always mind-blowing for me, because it was meant for one thing and it does it well: One-shot stories. 3-4 hours? You have a complete story. That, plus the Fiasco-style "narration-go-round" and the German Board Game style "worker placement system" (what kind of scene you want, what kind of information/data you want to go for, etc) of play... It's a game I never am bored of/stymied by playing or running. Every combo of players has brought something new/fun to the table.<br/><br/>Running Tenra well can take a lot out of me, especially when teaching the rules to new players at the same time as GMing (not so taxing when I'm running for folks familiar with the rules); but Ryuutama (with its kind of innocent style of descriptive/feelgood play and very traditional/familiar GM-Player structure) and Shinobigami (which pretty much runs itself) always seem to energize me back up.<br/><br/>Also on the radar: I'm likely going to do a quick crowdsource campaign at some point to publish my friend Miss Koalada's small-press comic-sized RPGs (namely Phantom Thief; but will do The Brave Little Ricecooker as a stretch goal) in the next six months or so, when there's some downtime.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417961/#Comment_417961" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-08T12:07:53+00:00" title="July  8, 2013 12:07PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To that end?

I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would certainly play it again, although would be hesitant about GMing it as I'm not very good at handling relatively complex systems.

On the one hand so far I know of exactly ONE GM-less RPG from Japan ("Giant Allege," where you play lawyers who duke it out in giant robots to determine who's innocent), but OTOH stuff like scene framing and relationship rules are downright commonplace. There's a certain elegant simplicity to a lot of Japanese TRPGs (especially anything by Kawashima, the main guy behind Adventure Planning Service and games like Shinobigami) that I'm kinda hoping will start to influence Western RPGs. I know it's had a huge influence on me.\n<blockquote><b>Maid</b><br/><br/>I haven't really put this one through its paces, honestly; I played it once and it was a decently fun outing, but I don't do a lot of slapstick gaming.

I really do think it's an important step forward in comedy/slapstick games, and (probably not consciously) improves on games like Toon and Teenagers From Outer Space. The Stress Explosion concept fits slapstick action a lot better than hit points, and letting players spend points to invoke random events is a brilliant way to ensure the proper level of mayhem. I don't play it a lot myself, but that's because it's one of the most exhausting RPGs I've ever run, as I frantically try to keep up with things and turn random events into something sorta coherent. For a game that basically came from the designer looking at the maid cafe fad in Japan and going "WTF?" it's kind of amazing just how much subtle game design is packed in there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm" title="Wilhelm"><img alt="Wilhelm" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/051/n020C47W1JTFZ.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wilhelm">Wilhelm</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418015/#Comment_418015" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T02:03:03+00:00" title="July  9, 2013  2:03AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://yarukizerogames.com/2010/02/11/witch-quest-book-ii-release" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://yarukizerogames.com/2010/02/11/witch-quest-book-ii-release</a> belongs here as well, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa" title="cucumberkappa"><img alt="cucumberkappa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/116/nSJOZL6HNH7NS.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cucumberkappa">cucumberkappa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418016/#Comment_418016" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-09T02:06:58+00:00" title="July  9, 2013  2:06AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before this month is out, I *ought* to have run both Golden Sky Stories and Maid the RPG. (The gaming circle I'm a part of on G+ has a lot of eager and active GM-y types, so it can be difficult to find an open day.)<br/><br/>I've scheduled GSS for this coming Sunday because after re-reading Maid, I realized I wasn't prepared to have my first GMing attempt be for something that can so easily get out of hand. (And deciding what information to prepare for the players was a bit overwhelming.) <br/><br/>Prepping for GSS is almost soothing, really. I mean, of course I am agonizing over the layout of the group character sheet document and how to handle Dreams (settled on another Drawing document so players can move tokens from the middle and onto the character's name) - but coming up with a scenario was easy and thinking about how the different character types might solve the problem makes me smile. It also makes me laugh a little to imagine how some of the players might take to the game. I'm not sure how many of them have played anything like it - the ones who've signed up so far are mainly players/GMs for darker/more twisted games like Monsterhearts, Dramasystem, Apocalypse World, Fiasco, Don't Rest Your Head; etc.<br/><br/>But reading over Maid again also makes me want to see where some of these same players take *that*. Especially if we go full Random and end up with these insane characters played by players who aren't afraid to fully invest in the spirit of a game and aren't likely to spend two and a half hours dusting lamps for fear of setting off a Stress Explosion.<br/><br/>On the TBZ front, I've sort of started to brainstorm a scenario, but I feel like I need more intimate familiarity with the game before seriously working on it. I think of it as one of those huge novelty desserts with all sorts of things in it like brownies and nuts and a pint of ice cream and half a jar of cherries and probably two cans of whipped cream and a handful of pretty waffers. Boy is it exciting. Boy is it pretty. But good lawd, there's a lot of it and where to start when you don't have a group to help you...!?<br/><br/>I'll try to report back later once I've done more than start prepping for these games. It's really wonderful to me to have an insight to how other people around the world game. Gamers are gamers everywhere, of course, but reading some of these books makes me think of how it's approached differently. Every once in awhile, I trip a bit over things that seem to clue into what might be common gaming problems in Japan that a Western (or at least American) gamer wouldn't think twice about. So I'd love to see games from other countries make it to English too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418144/#Comment_418144" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T12:34:18+00:00" title="July 11, 2013 12:34PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2013 2:01PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I want to run a game of Double Cross soonish, and thinking out loud about the book is the best way to me to internalize it enough to do that and make a cheat sheet for my players, so I figure I'll just do it in public and maybe someone else will find it interesting? <br/><br/>For those who don't know (which is probably a lot of people; this came out very under the radar), <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Double-Cross-Role-playing-Game-Rulebook/dp/0615708110" rel="nofollow">Double Cross</a> is a tabletop RPG from Japan that's been out for a few years and is supposed to be decently popular, a creation of FEAR, one of the big RPG publishers who also created the also-recently-translated Tenra Bansho Zero.  TBZ and DX don't share any staff, but the former seems pretty influential on the latter.  <br/><br/>I first heard of Double Cross a few years back <a href="http://www.j-rpg.com/talk/discussion/42/double-cross-3rd-edition-solid" rel="nofollow">from</a> <a href="http://faustusnotes.wordpress.com/2010/04/30/japanese-role-playing-game-double-cross-3-introduction/" rel="nofollow">some</a> <a href="http://faustusnotes.wordpress.com/tag/double-cross-3/" rel="nofollow">discussion</a> on the always interesting but low-traffic <a href="http://j-rpg.com/" rel="nofollow">J-RPG</a> forums.  The English release is only a few weeks old, and is actually of the third edition of the game.  In fact, it's actually the deluxe version; the Japanese release is split up into <a href="http://www.j-rpg.com/talk/discussion/53/double-cross-buying-guide" rel="nofollow">essentially a basic book and an advanced guide</a>, but ours includes both.  Which does mean that it's kind of a lot to familiarize yourself with, which is why I'm doing this.<br/><br/>The premise is basically dark superheroes, in that particularly Japanese way where they don't have secret identities per se, but kind of wage a shadow war that goes unnoticed by the normal world, and they usually share their powers with or were even given them by the forces they're fighting, which is often a keen point of angst.  Kamen Rider, X/1999, Project ARMS, that sort of thing.  An archeological dig 20 years ago unleashed "the Renegade Virus" into the world (and it is very much a comic-book "virus", in that it is semi-intelligent, can infect machines, and even create vampires from thin air, but we'll get to that later), and now an estimated 80% of the world's population are carriers, so basically anyone under traumatic stress can potentially have an origin and become an Overed.  The UGN (Universal Guardian Network) are the setting's SHIELD/X-COM quasi-governmental secret taskforce to protect the world with virus-wielding agents (and a fairly easy hook to connect the PCs to one another), and the False Hearts are the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants who want to awaken the virus in everyone and have a big transhuman post-morality party.  Oh, and both organizations may have been founded by the same guy, one Professor Caudwell, who was at one point presumed dead but then resurfaced working with FH.  Oh, the melodrama!<br/><br/>The book is not actually laid out this way, but I think it's a good idea to start with the basic rules engine.<br/><br/>There are four stats, [Body] [Mind] [Sense] and [Social] (to use the book's notation), and then each has several skills that fall under it, like Melee and Dodge are governed by [Body], Ranged (weapons) under [Senses], and so on.  Hit points are derived from your [Body] and [Mind], and initiative (a static value, no initiative rolls in this system) from your [Sense] and [Mind].<br/><br/>To do something, you roll [stat]D10, choose the single highest die, then add skill to the value.  However, dice explode, so rolling a 10 means you keep the 10, then reroll and add the new result as well.  Dice can keep exploding, but multiple dice don't stack; if you roll more than one 10, you get to reroll all of them, but only count one of those 10s to your final result.<br/><br/>Another detail is that "10" is just the default Critical Value, and there are ways to lower it, so if you make a roll with CV8, that means rolls of 8, 9, and 10 all explode (and still count as "10" in terms of adding up the numerical value).<br/><br/>Also, if all dice come up 1, that's an automatic failure.<br/><br/>This is a game about fighting and melodrama, so the rules mainly focus on whupping ass and keeping your mental composure and sort of leave everything else to roleplaying; like, there's no real encumbrance, and keeping track of money is basically governed by making [Social] Procure rolls to buy things off the equipment list, the Ranged skill includes all weapons that strike at a distance and you don't bother keeping track of ammo. There are an absolute smorgasbord of powers, though, most of which are special cases (though there are some recurring patterns, like powers that let you substitute one skill for another, such as using Perception in place of Dodge).<br/><br/>Oh, why is it called Double Cross?  It kind of makes sense in a poetic, Engrishy way.  As the short comic at the book's start says, "There are people who struggle between human and superbeing.  There are Double-Crossers-- Traitors to both sides of the world."<br/><br/>Next time... man, there's a lot to get to.  I guess I'll go over character creation and maybe get into the powers a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix" title="zoatebix"><img alt="zoatebix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zoatebix">zoatebix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418150/#Comment_418150" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T13:57:49+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  1:57PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for thinking out-loud, <a href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">@Joe_McGuffin</a>!<br/><br/>I think your use of brackets in the style of the book has resulted in the names of some skills getting mis-parsed as tags and disappearing from your post, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418152/#Comment_418152" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T14:19:54+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  2:19PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2013 2:32PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Augh, thanks for catching that, George!  Yeah, screw following the book's typography, then.<br/><br/>Let's see... if I want to talk about character creation, I have to address the powers at least briefly first, since they define so much about your character.<br/><br/>So the viral powers are divided up more or less by theme between twelve Syndromes (as well as a smaller pool of generic powers anyone can buy, some of which are mandatory buys for all characters... including the sample characters, despite them not being printed on their character sheets), which have some pretty interesting names.  I'll go more in depth on them later, but let's at least make their acquaintance:<br/><br/>Angel Halo, "Manipulation of Light. Capable of laser attacks and illusions."<br/>Balor, "Controls gravity through the use of an 'Evil Eye'.  Creates gravity wells to manipulate time and space."<br/>Black Dog, "Controls internally-produced electricity.  On top of lightning attacks, cybernetic implants are also possible."<br/>Bram Stoker, "Uses one's blood as a weapon.  Accelerated healing is also possible through manipulation of blood flow."<br/>Chimera, "Acquire the body of a beast.  Gain superhuman strength and speed by restructuring the body."<br/>Exile, "Controls the elasticity of the body.  Use nails as sharp weapons or relocate vital organs."<br/>Hanuman, "Enhances the nervous system and increases speed.  Capable of generating sound waves."<br/>Morpheus, "Creates and mutates items.  Can manipulate the residual dust from creation."<br/>Neumann, "Enhances mental capabilities.  Faster thinking and better memory are this Syndrome's weapons."<br/>Orcus, "Creates a special 'domain' where the user can manipulate any event that happens in the created space,"<br/>Salamandra, "Allows one to manipulate heat.  Fire or extreme cold can be used for attacks or enhancing physical capabilities."<br/>Solaris, "Grants the ability to create chemicals.  Can control people through poison and drugs."<br/><br/>OK, so the first step is narrowing down your power pool.  The default character is assumed to be a Crossbreed, someone with access to two Syndromes.  You can also choose to be a Tri-Breed, with access to three (at the cost of having a lower rating on all those powers compared to a Crossbreed, and without access to the top-tier powers of any of their Syndromes), or a Pure-Breed, with just one Syndrome, but a higher rating cap on all its powers, and access to the two special Pure-Breed-only powers each Syndrome has.  Without having made a character or played yet, Tri- and Pure-Breeds definitely seem like advanced options for players who already have some familiarity with the system.  And frankly, most of the Pure-Breed powers don't seem cool enough to justify losing an entire additional powerset, though one or two are pretty nifty.<br/><br/>Your choice of Syndromes determine your starting stats; Chimera prioritizes [Body], Neumann [Mind], etc, but you also get a few discretionary points to throw around.<br/><br/>Next you choose your Work; your day job from before you became one of the X-Men.  There are some UGN occupations in here (including "raised by them away from human society" and "branch chief"), and a bunch of mundane ones, like Grade School Student, Doctor, Teacher, Hacker, Assassin (OK, maybe that last is a little exotic) and so on.  That gives you another little [stat] bump and a handful of skills, but you again get some extra skill points to spread around.  You also pick another Work to serve as your "Cover", which doesn't have any mechanical impact but adds some more color to your character, if you want it.  "High School Student" twice is just some random kid who started shooting lightning out of his eyes on day, but "UGN Child" Work with "High School Student" as Cover is, like, if one of those kids from Akira went undercover 21 Jump Street style.<br/><br/>This is also a good place to note that there are basically three main fighting styles; armed/unarmed via [Body] Melee, ranged via [Senses] Ranged, and "supernatural" via [Mind] Renegade Control.  In general, powers that do things like generate bolts of lightning or attack the mind directly use RC instead of Ranged, but there is some overlap.   It's worth keeping in mind as you build your character, at least.<br/><br/>Then you get four powers from your Syndrome(s) and the generic pool, a couple more points to raise their levels (some powers cap out at level 1, though), and three powers every character starts with.  Those freebies are worth going into, because two of them say a lot about the intended feel and playstyle of the game, in ways I think are smart and very cool.<br/><br/>The first one is Resurrect. Yes, every single player character does not fear death; when you drop to 0 HP, you can immediately get back up, or wait until the end of the scene instead if you want to take the hint and stay down.  There are some limits on it (you don't heal back to full, it raises your Encroachment Rate, and you can't use it when your Encroachment is too high... we will get to Encroachment later, but for now think of it more or less like sanity points or Tenra Bansho Zero's Karma), but I really like the thematic statement that characters are too cool and resilient to be taken down so easily, and the mechanical one that you don't need to worry about prioritizing defense from the get-go just to avoid getting one-shotted by accident.  Which is extra good because it looks like characters can sling around some serious damage when they start stacking their powers together.  Oh, and it's not the only "come back from 0 HP" power in the game, either, there are a few ways to get extra lives.<br/><br/>The second gimme is Warding.  I'll quote this one in full, especially since we should probably have a look at the game's power format for later.<br/><br/>Warding<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Auto <br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Scene Range: View<br/>Encroach: 0 Restrict: -<br/><br/>"This Power can be used at any time.  All non-Overed characters in this Scene become Extras.  All Overeds that are in the Scene will automatically sense that this power was used.  The effects of this Power continue throughout the Scene."<br/><br/>So basically, at any time, anyone with superpowers can flip the "it's GO TIME" switch and turn off all the bystanders (Extras basically have no game mechanics; they're not considered to have any HP, all actions against them succeed automatically).  You know how the Power Rangers always seem to end up fighting in a deserted city or vacant stone quarry, or the magic zones people throw down in X?  It's like that.  It doesn't cost anything to use, it alerts everyone who's in the know, and it preserves the Masquerade (other parts of the book suggest non-Overeds pass out or flee when they get hit with this; it depends on your character's flavor, I guess).  It's very meta, but it's again very useful for communicating the intended play style, and it even exists in-character so your character can worry about not letting Aunt May know your horrible secret without having to go through all kinds of contortions to actually prevent it.  I like it.<br/><br/>The last free power is interesting mechanically but not thematically; everyone gets Concentrate:(Syndrome), which lowers the Critical Value on all rolls involving the syndrome they picked when they bought the power. So Concentrate: Black Dog (level 2) means any rolls to use a Black Dog power have their dice explode on 8, 9, or 10.  Or to be more precise, any Black Dog power rolls that also have Concentrate: Black Dog comboed in; the power/combat rules for Double Cross assume a fair bit of system mastery and willingness to build kooky combos that will seem very familiar to veterans of Exalted, though DX's combo rules are more forgiving by far.  I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418153/#Comment_418153" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-11T14:21:39+00:00" title="July 11, 2013  2:21PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2013 2:25PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I managed to hit the character limit in that last post!  So I will now mention that the book has three different methods of character creation.  So far we've been covering a Constructed character.  Doing a Quick Start one involves using one of the 14 pregenerated characters, who are complete through this step, and then finishing them up by picking your backstory and Loises, which we'll get into next. Or you can go Full Scratch, where you don't get any discretionary points or powers, just a bunch of raw XP to spend as you will.  When I get around to testing this out, Quick Start is the way to go.<br/><br/>And speaking of the pregens (oh, and you can look at their character art <a href="http://www.fear.co.jp/dbx3rd/about/sc01_info.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a> and <a href="http://www.fear.co.jp/dbx3rd/about/sc02_info.htm" rel="nofollow">here</a>, but no stats or even English), I want to link <a href="https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B0o4CqKUlcLqWUhHWGJ2YTJPU00/edit" rel="nofollow">the errata PDF</a>.  Sadly, there are a lot of typos in this book, in both the prose and rules, but at least they're pretty good about keeping the errata up to date.  Unfortunately, all the pregenerated characters are messed up to some degree, so you really need the errata to play the game at all.<br/><br/>OK, that's long enough for today, I'll go into the backstory part of character creation next time.

This is expressed by picking Renegade Being as your Work, which also gets you another two powers, Humanity's Neighbor (which lets you fake being human) and an Origin (which you use when you want to take the mask off).  Origin powers include things like Animal, Colony (like, you used to be a coral reef or a bunch of mold), Cyber (IT CAME FROM THE INTERNET), and even Legend (like, you are a unicorn or something the virus created from the memories of humanity's collective unconscious.  One of the pregenerated characters is a Renegade Being who appears to be a vampire).  There are a few other Renegade Being-only powers too, which is one of the things the "Restrict" entry in Warding's statblock referred to (or rather, didn't).<br/><br/>All we have left for character creation is Personal Data, which is basically your character's backstory and some personality stuff.  Everything in this section is "Roll or Choice", either roll percentile dice on a table, or just choose the one you like.  It's worth noting that a few tables have options that can't be gotten randomly.<br/><br/>The first three tables are for Origin, Experience, and Encounter, and each of them fills in a little of your backstory and establishes a supporting NPC for your character, referred to as a Lois (yes, like Lois Lane, though the book doesn't actually spell this out, unlike the Syndrome references).  The Origin fleshes out your character's family (so Loises might be a parent or sibling), and Experience has a few tables dependent on your Work, with pretty variable results depending on if you pick Student, UGN, Adult, or Criminal (you might end up with a spouse or a monster hunting you).  Origin and Experience just have suggestions for a Lois that you can flesh out, but the Encounter is specifically with one of the two dozen or so signature NPCs, to tie your character more directly into the setting.<br/><br/>Once you have your three starting Loises, you go to the Emotion tables to add some context to the relationship (very Tenra Bansho).  Every Lois has a positive and negative emotion associated with it, and you should decide which one is overt and which is covert. So, say, you might have a co-worker you outwardly respect but secretly or subconsciously despise-- or vice versa.  It's worth noting that you don't have to have a positive relationship with your Lois-- your character just has to feel strongly enough about them to be invested in the relationship, to provide a tie to society.  <br/><br/>This ties into the last two Personal Data tables, which represent the ways in which your character is outside society and humanity, their Awakening (the circumstances that led to their viral powers erupting) and Impulse (the negative emotions or urges they have to keep in check or risk losing their humanity).  Those two results determine your character's base Encroachment Rate.<br/><br/>After that, pick up some equipment if you like, and that's the end of character creation!  So let's go back and actually explain some of the things we had to gloss over.<br/><br/>Lois, Titus, and Encroachment are all pretty closely tied together...  Let's start with Encroachment.<br/><br/>Your Encroachment Rate measures how strong the Renegade virus concentration is in your system.  You start every session with Encroachment set to your Base rate (which will usually be in the 30s), and it can go as high as 300%. (MAX SYNCHRO, EGO BARRIER DISSOLUTION, etc)<br/><br/>Encroachment rises when you use most powers (though permanent ones tend to just raise your Base Encroachment instead), by 1d10 whenever you enter a scene, and whenever the GM decides you should make an Impulse Check.  When should the GM call for one?  That's left pretty vague; any time a character receives "an intense mental shock" or "any time [the GM] feels it is appropriate," and the sample adventures in the back suggest the PCs should make one right before the climactic fight of the session.  Impulse Checks are pretty harsh; succeed or fail, your Encroachment rises 2d10 points, and if you fail your character goes Berserk (which is less extreme than it sounds, but still not great).  You can also just choose to raise it by any number of d10 at any time.<br/><br/>Why do that?  Well, having a high viral concentration means your super-powers are going into overdrive; you get bonus dice on every action based on how high your Encroachment is, and past a certain threshold the level of your powers increases too.  You even get bonus XP at session's end based on how high you managed to jack up your Encroachment Rate.<br/><br/>Wow!  What possible catch could there be to filling every cell of your body with a mind-affecting mutagen?  Well, if you end the session with Encroachment over 99%, you lose your character, as their higher brain functions can no longer resist their Impulse and they become... what the original book refers to as a Germ, but the English version re-transliterates as "Gjaum".<br/><br/>(On the other hand, if you do lose your character, XP is explicitly assigned to players instead of characters, so you can dump it into your next character instead of just starting from scratch) <br/><br/>So how do you avoid giving into the germ, if just playing the game is enough to raise Encroachment?  That's where the Loises come in.  Whether your character loves them or hates them, the emotional ties connecting you is an anchor you can focus on to avoid being swept away into viral madness.  At session's end, you can Backtrack the virus' influence by rolling 1d10 per Lois, and reduce your Encroachment by the total.  You can even make the roll more than once if your Encroachment is really in the red zone, but that penalizes your XP some.<br/><br/>You always start and end a session with three Loises (after rolling for Backtrack), but during play you can have up to seven.  The book suggests that players should form one with the PC next to them at the start of the session, and that the GM should also assign another to everyone at the start of every adventure/session as a plot hook.  You can also pick them up during scenes if you take a shine to some NPC and the GM OK's it.  The book suggests that more conceptual Loises are fine (like, faith in an organization, or dependence on drugs), but best saved for when you have some experience with the game.  <br/><br/>However, reducing Encroachment isn't the only thing you can do with a Lois.  At any time, you can renounce your feelings for them and declare them Titus (as in Titus Andronicus, presumably, but as someone who's only seen the Julie Taymor movie it seems more like the PC is in the Titus role swearing revenge on these people... but anyway), burning your bridges with them and using that catharsis to fuel a short-term burst of strength.  I won't list everything they're good for, but two big ones are reviving after losing all HP, and rolling an extra ten dice on anything.<br/><br/>The GM is also allowed to suggest a Lois change to Titus if the relationship takes a sudden, drastic turn for the worse, like if the Lois dies or betrays the PC.<br/><br/>OK, that's another good place to break; next time I'll start going over the Syndromes, but I think I'll need to talk about combat a little to give some context, because the vast majority of the almost 600 PC-accessible powers in the book involve combat or have combat-timing-related restrictions on their use.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418376/#Comment_418376" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T13:55:15+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  1:55PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't mind me, just dropping off this load of text.<br/><br/>I should also mention that Double Cross is fairly light on art.  There's a brief intro comic (that's really more of a trailer for the game than an actual sequentially told story), a few full-page pieces to break up sections and introduce new concepts (each Syndrome gets one, as do the adventures), and there are headshots of the signature NPCs, but by and large this book is big ol' blocks of text.  If I cared less about the spine of this book, I'd scan in the amazing diagram of where each section of character creation corresponds to on your character's body.<br/><br/>So, combat isn't that complicated or different than most games you've probably played, though there is a fair amount of game-specific jargon that I'm going to skip over, since it's mainly for power timing and combo purposes (like, a character can be in either a Pre-Action or Post-Action state, or, as we usually know it, "hasn't acted this round" or "has acted this round").<br/><br/>Combat is broken into rounds of roughly a minute apiece, and rounds are themselves divided into Setup (not much happens here, but it's a step some powers trigger during), Initiative (ditto, but this is also where you can decide to hold your action, but if you do you act after everyone else, no trying to interrupt someone else), the Main Process (where you actually act), and Cleanup (manage any ongoing effects and end the round).<br/><br/>Characters act in descending order of their Initiative ratings (PCs win ties with NPCs, tied PCs can work it out between themselves), and on their turn can take a Minor action (move around, equip an item, use some powers) and a Major (make an attack, sprint, use most powers).  You get one of each, no trading around.<br/><br/>Combat movement is semi-freeform, and it reminds me a bit of the current edition of Warhammer Fantasy; pretty much every power or weapon has an effective range given in meters, but the important part is whether you're Engaged with someone or not.  If you're moving around and bump into an enemy or an obstacle, you stop moving right there and can't break away without spending a Major Action (you don't get back attacked while moving away or anything, but you also can't move to a different Engagement in that same movement).  You might need to make a Body roll if you're in tight quarters or actively blocked in, too.  There are a number of powers that don't work on someone you're Engaged with, and to flee a fight entirely you need to spend a Major action to dash away in a direction where nothing will Engage you. <br/><br/>Attacking somebody is a skill test like any other, the stat and skill depending on what you're using.  The defender can choose to either make an opposed roll using Body/Dodge to avoid it (hmm, rules contradiction here; the general rules for opposed checks say the reacting character wins ties, but the combat chapter says a defender needs to beat the attacker's roll), or skip the roll and Guard instead, adding their Guard stat to any armor they're wearing to reduce the damage  (Guard defaults to 0 without any equipment or powers, though).  A successful attack rolls (1/10th the attack result)d10 damage +another 1d10 +any weapon/power bonuses, minus the target's armor.  Engagement plays a role here too; someone in the same Engagement who hasn't acted yet can spend their entire turn to Cover the target and take the damage instead, calculating it as if they were Guarding.<br/><br/>Speaking of damage, an interesting thing to point out here is that there is no first aid/healing kinda skill, and no way to naturally recover hit points.  There are medkits you can buy, and a fair few powers let you heal yourself or others (and a few that let you ignore damage or self-resurrect), but it's unusual that all healing must be actively sought out.<br/><br/>There are some other miscellaneous rules that cover fighting while flying, or from stealth (which are also affected by Engagement), running someone over with a car (pretty relevant given some of the Morpheus powers!) and a bunch of status ailments I won't bother getting into, they mostly disallow some kind of option (can't move, can't defend, etc) and are usually dispelled by using one of your actions to deal with it (either Minor or Major). <br/><br/>I told you that story so I could tell you this one: on to the powers!   They are kind of the meat of the game, since they cover over a hundred pages of the book, and come before they even explain how to make a skill check.  I think I brought this up before, but I'll be frank; Double Cross assumes that you'll be willing to devote some serious time to gaining system mastery, since you can invoke theoretically any number of powers at once, as long as they all share the same timing (Setup phase, Initiative phase, Major Action, reacting to someone else's action, etc) and enhance the same thing (melee attack, ranged attack, use the same specific skill, etc). When combining powers, you use the fewest targets, shortest range, and highest difficulty of all the powers involved.<br/><br/>There are also plenty of powers that specifically exist to boost other powers, like making them affect more targets, cover a wider area, and so on, and several that enhance actions (like, increase Guard or let you Cover at a distance or without using up your turn).  However, a power with Target: Self can't be upgraded to affect more targets (but conversely, the user is a valid target for a power with Target: Single).  Something that's easy to miss if you're just reading the power descriptions is that all the powers that increase your Guard stat apply if you Cover someone, not just if you're guarding yourself.  On the other hand, powers that can't be Dodged or reacted to don't allow you to Guard either.<br/><br/>Most if not all of the Syndromes have powers that add dice to attack rolls or damage to attacks, so I won't specifically call them out.  They all also have a few powers that require Encroachments of 80%, 100% or 120% to use, and almost all Syndromes have a 120% Encroachment power that either reduces damage to 0 or revives you when you run out of HP, so you can really stack the extra lives, which is good because you can also stack damage pretty high, looks like.  I won't be able to tell just how rocket-taggy the combat is until I actually run it, but I appreciate that they acknowledge that getting one-shotted is a potential issue. <br/><br/>Each Syndrome also has some Simple powers, which cover non-combat-relevant but very useful powers which usually can't be used during combat-time... and I need to break up this post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418377/#Comment_418377" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-15T13:57:10+00:00" title="July 15, 2013  1:57PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 15, 2013 1:58PM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just can't seem to stay within the post limits!   So let's have a quick addendum with the Angel Halo Syndrome.  Angel Halo is themed around manipulating light (to make illusions, turn invisible, or just shoot lasers), but it also involves boosting all five senses for enhanced perception (which you can then use to shoot lasers better).  Notable synergies include powers that grant Stealth or can be used during Stealth, and a power that lets you dodge attacks with Perception (which is actually a bit of an anti-combo, since there are other Dodge-enhancers in here that specifically key off the Dodge skill).  Attack powers cover Melee, Ranged, and Renegade Control, and there's one that lets you make RC checks with Sense instead of Mind.<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>Pinpoint Laser<br/>Max Level: 5 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: Syndrome Difficulty: Opposed<br/>Target: - Range :-<br/>Encroach: 2 Restrict: -<br/><br/>Attacks that use this power ignore the target's Armor stat during damage calculation.  This attack receives a -(5-LVL) Attack Power penalty (Max penalty of 0).</blockquote>\nSkill: Syndrome means it has to be comboed with at least one other Angel Halo power to be used at all, so it takes its Target and Range from those (but a dash under Skill means they only combine with other powers that don't key off a skill; again, SYSTEM MASTERY.  And the dash under Restriction means it's not limited to Renegade Beings or Pure-Breeds).  Also note that since it doesn't specify a melee or ranged attack, it can be used for either.<br/><br/>Let's do a Simple Power too:\n<blockquote><br/>Hound's Nose<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range : Close<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Connect the sense of smell and sight together, giving one the ability to "see" scents and particles with the precision of an electron microscope.  The User will be able to differentiate between bacteria, viruses, and dust.  In addition, any previously "seen" scents and particles will be committed to memory.</blockquote>\nCrazy, right?<br/><br/>Next time, some more powers.  Maybe I can blow through the rest of the Syndromes now that all the boilerplate's out of the way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418425/#Comment_418425" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-16T08:51:15+00:00" title="July 16, 2013  8:51AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is good stuff!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418501/#Comment_418501" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T05:15:17+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  5:15AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2013 9:13AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks! Just glad someone else is finding this useful.  I think I can knock out the rest of the Syndromes in one more post... or more likely, two. <br/><br/>I should also say, for all the flak I give the book over typos, I have to admit that the index is damn good. If nothing else it would be impossible to reference all the powers if they weren't all indexed.  Kudos on that.<br/><br/>OK, time to go Syndrome crazy!  I'll do one combat power and a simple power for each.<br/><br/>Balor is named for some Fomorian dude with a fiery eye-- not the first RPG to reference him.  The relevance is that this Syndrome's powers create a floating black hole that warps spacetime in any number of amusing ways.  Balor makes you good at moving around, messing with other people's movement, changing Initiative numbers, and using gravity distortions to help Guard.  There's some support for Melee and Ranged fighting, but most of the interesting things use Renegade Control.\n<blockquote>Repulsion Jump<br/>Max Level: 5 Timing: Minor<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range: Close<br/>Encroach: 1 Restrict: -<br/><br/>The User temporarily gains Flight and performs a Move.  For this Move, the User may travel an extra (LVx5) meters.</blockquote>\nSo Flight can be fun.  The main game effect is that you can fly right over any obstacle or non-flying person trying to block your movement or Engage you-- but you can keep people on the ground locked up in your Engagement if you like.  Mind, if you Engage someone on the ground, you're still in melee range of them.\n<blockquote>Time Sorcerer<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Refer Range: Close<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Change the flow of time around an object so that it ages at a different pace.  This Power targets inanimate objects like buildings and vases.  Live beings that are unwilling cannot be affected.  With this Power, buildings may be ruined, art may be discolored, and drying or fermentation times may be shortened.</blockquote>\nBlack Dog: "The name of this Syndrome is a reference to a black dog of English legend that always appears with lightning."  Okay!  This lets you control electricity and machines, including machines implanted into your body-- there are a bunch of permanent Powers that say "you have a robot part that does such-and-so", often some kind of stat boost.  Other powers let you add dice to Ride checks, increase your max HP, heal yourself, and play defibrillator to revive other people from 0 HP.  This Syndrome mostly attacks with RC, and there's a power that lets you use it to Dodge too.\n<blockquote>Cyber Arm<br/>Max Level: 10 Timing: Constant<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range: Close<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Modify the User's Fists to the following data:<br/><br/>Type: Melee Skill: Melee<br/>Accuracy: +0 Attack Power: + (Level + 3)<br/>Guard: 5 Range: Close<br/><br/>This power cannot receive the Encroachment Rate level bonus.  The character's Base Encroachment Rate increases by 3 when this power is acquired.</blockquote>\nSo here's an example of cyberware, which is also our first example of equipment and our first permanent power. It's worth noting that powers that change the stats of your fists stack (but you pick the best modifer in each category instead of adding them all together), so you could have cyber werewolf claws if you dip into Black Dog and Chimera.\n<blockquote>Radio Wave Jamming<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Scene Range: View<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Block all communications and radars in the area by disrupting radio waves.  Cellphones, transceivers, wireless LANs, shortwave communications, and whole areas of a radar will be rendered useless.  If the GM feels it is necessary, he may require an RC check for this Power.</blockquote>\nBram Stoker is named after the guy what wrote Dracula, because it's all about blood manipulation. Make weapons and armor out of your blood, steal HP from targets (especially handy since some of your powers cost HP), and even make your own little Renfield by birthing Servants from your veins.  There are a lot of powers devoted to bleeding out Pokemon to fight for you or improving their stats, the attack powers that you yourself use are pretty evenly divided between the three methods, and there's a power that lets you dodge with Will.  \n<blockquote>Bloody Banquet<br/>Max Level: 3 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: Syndrome Difficulty: Opposed<br/>Target: Area (Select) Range: -<br/>Encroach: 3 Restrict: -<br/><br/>Attacks that use this Power are modified to [Target: Area (Select)].  This Power may be used (Level) times per Scenario.</blockquote>\nMeta-power.  Note that this doesn't specify ranged or melee, so have fun stabbing everyone in arm's reach. First time we've seen Area (Select); that means everyone in a single Engagement is a possible target, but you can choose targets to exclude from the effect.  Target: Area rains down on the just and unjust alike.  Scene and Scene (Select) are similar.\n<blockquote>Life Representative<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Constant<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Refer Range: Refer <br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Create a special Servant that will carry out all of one's daily tasks, such as school, work, housework, government applications, bills and so forth.  This Servant will look just like the User, but it will be treated as an Extra.  Thus, it cannot join a battle.  This Servant does not count towards Red Servant's limit.</blockquote>\nMan, I would love to have this power in real life.  Red Servant is the base "create a minion" power that all the various upgrades stem from.  I suppose, technically, you could have this without knowing Red Servant, since Life Representative creates the minion within its own rules text?<br/><br/>Chimaera is another easy reference for RPG players. This one lets you grow wings, claws, and other assorted animal parts, awaken your animal instincts and all that jazz, and I hope you like Melee because all its attacks use it.  There are a couple movement powers to get around the general lack of range (including access to flight), some HP buffing and self-healing, and a Perception buff that might be interesting to combo with that Perception dodge from Angel Halo.\n<blockquote>Mars' Defense<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Auto<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range: Close<br/>Encroach: 2 Restrict: -<br/><br/>Declare right before a Damage roll.  The User performs a Cover.  This Cover does not make the User enter the Post-Action state and can be performed even if the User is already in the Post-Action state.  This Power may only be used once per Main Process.</blockquote>\nSo this one lets you pounce and Cover your nearby buddies once during anyone's turn (there are several Main Processes during one round) without forfeiting your turn, and even if you've already acted.  This goes well with the other Chimaera powers that give you armor or buff your Guard.\n<blockquote>Dormant Genes<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Constant<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self  Range: Close<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Awaken the dormant animal genes in one's body, allowing one to stay in animal form throughout the day.  The User only gets an animal's form and none of its instincts or behaviors.  If someone attempts to see past the User's animal form, that character and the User must perform a Perception Opposed Check.</blockquote>\nBe a kitty!<br/><br/>And... need to break.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418502/#Comment_418502" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T05:16:34+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  5:16AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2013 9:14AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 2 of... 3, looks like.<br/><br/>Exile's name is a Shinto reference, to the boneless, banished creature Hiruko. This is the Syndrome if you want to be Dhalsim or Flukeman.  Attacks are pretty evenly split between Melee and Ranged... and honestly, on a read-through it doesn't seem to have many tricks that aren't found in other Syndromes, one notable exception being a power that can negate any Timing: Auto power.  It is one of the few powersets that heal people, and while most Syndromes have access to status ailments, Exile is unusual in being able to inflict four out of the six.  There's also a dice-adder for Info checks, with the flavor text "The User can detach their body parts for information gathering".\n<blockquote>Elastic Arm<br/>Max Level: 3 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: Melee Difficulty: Opposed<br/>Target: - Range: View<br/>Encroach: 2 Restrict: -<br/><br/>Melee attacks that use this Power are modified to (Range: View).

In order to use this Power, the target must be Incapacitated, asleep or unconscious.  While inside the target, the User has Stealth and will follow the host when he Moves.  This Power's effect automatically ends when Stealth is negated.</blockquote>\nGross.<br/><br/>Hanuman is named for a Hindu ape deity sometimes conflated with China's Monkey King (at least by Masamune Shirow, anyway).  Mechanically, that translates to super-speed and sonic effects, the latter including the ability to buff your allies by making your voice super charismatic and inspiring.  Attacks cover all three approaches, slightly favoring Melee and RC, and several effects key off the Negotiation skill, including one of the attacks.  There are also dice-adders for Perception and Info in here.\n<blockquote>Light Speed<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Minor<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range: Close<br/>Encroach: 5 Restrict: 100%<br/><br/>For the current Main Process, user may perform two Major Actions.  Handle each check separately.  The User receives a +1 Critical Value penalty for these Major Actions.  This Power may only be used once per Scenario.</blockquote>\nLet's check out one of the advanced ones.  The Restriction there means two things; your Encroachment has to be at least 100% to use this, and Tri-Breeds can't even learn it (they can't buy any power with a restriction of 100% or more).  Also, that CV penalty is harsh; unless you have some way to lower it, that means you need to do the impossible and roll an 11 to make your dice explode.  Good thing everyone comes with a couple levels of Concentrate for free.<br/><br/>...also, looking more closely at the combat chapter, I see that you specifically have to take your Minor action before your Major, so you can't use this to get three Major Actions total.\n<blockquote>Air Instrument<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Refer Range: View<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Playback any speech or song by utilizing the atmosphere as various instruments and speakers.  As long as the User clearly remembers a song or conversation, he can perfectly recreate it.</blockquote>\nMorpheus is named more for "morphing" than the god of sleep; it's a tinkerer's Syndrome, able to instantly create and modify vehicles and equipment.  This is a fairly versatile suite of powers; attacks cover all three methods, there's some healing, a power that lets you dodge with RC, and dice-boosts for Info, Art, Knowledge, Ride, and Procure.  The important thing to remember is that with Morpheus you always have enough guns to shoot a John Woo movie, and if you get really good at it you can summon a mecha suit.\n<blockquote>Hundred Guns<br/>Max Level: 5 Timing: Minor<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range: Close<br/>Encroach: 3 Restrict: -<br/><br/>The User creates and equips a weapon that lasts for the remainder of the Scene.  Its data is as follows:<br/><br/>Type: Ranged Skill: Ranged <br/>Accuracy: +0 Attack Power: + (Level + 4)<br/>Guard: - Range: 30M</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Folding<br/>Max Level: 10 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range: Close<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Hide an object from people by folding it flat.  The User can hide up to (Level) number of objects of any size.  If someone attempts to find the hidden objects, that character and the user must perform a Perception opposed check.</blockquote>\nNeumann honors the polymath genius John von Neumann, and increases your mental processing speed and data analysis, which also equates to super-efficient martial arts a la Robert Downey's Holmes.  There are no RC-based attacks here, but there is some skill-swapping (use Will instead of Info, or Melee and Ranged with Mind) and plenty of buffs for allies (some of which key on Negotiation for easy combos with Hanuman), particularly an amazing 120% power that gives you or anyone else an extra turn, before anyone else acts. <br/>\n<blockquote>Genius' Insight<br/>Max Level: 3 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: Refer Difficulty: -<br/>Target: - Range: -<br/>Encroach: 4 Restrict: -<br/><br/>This Power may be used with all Stat and Skill checks.  The check receives a -(Level) (Min. 7) Critical Value bonus.  This Power cannot be used in battle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Doctor Dolittle<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Constant<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range: Close<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>The user has mastered all of the world's languages and can communicate with animals.  The user will never be at a loss for words.  If the GM feels it is necessary, he may require a Negotiation check for this Power.</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418503/#Comment_418503" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-17T05:17:14+00:00" title="July 17, 2013  5:17AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Final stretch!<br/><br/>Orcus' name is a little misleading.  It is almost certainly a reference to the D&amp;D demon lord, but the connection is specifically to the original Roman lord of the underworld instead of Gygax's god of undeath.  This Syndrome is really loosely themed; all the powers are flavored around being able to bend reality and probability near the user, so pretty much anything is justifiable because magic pixie dust spraying everywhere. There are some buffs and debuffs (some using Negotiation), a dodge that uses RC, die-adders for Info, Ride, and Negotiation, and all but one of the attacks use RC.\n<blockquote>Fairy Hand<br/>Max Level: 3 Timing: Auto<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Single Range: View<br/>Encroach: 4 Restrict: -<br/><br/>Declare right after the Target rolls dice for a check.  Change one of the dice to a 10.  This power can be used while the Target is performing a check.  This Power may only be used once per check and only (Level) times per Scenario.</blockquote>\nNow, Single Target technically means you can use it on yourself, but I'm not sure the timing allows for it, because you need to combine Powers to declare more than one at a time, and if you're performing the check you want to modify you've already made your declaration?  Or maybe you could use it on a roll if no other powers are being used that action?  Uhhh...\n<blockquote>Machine's Voice<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Refer Range: Close<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Make a machine or item operate autonomously by embedding it with particles.  Only simple tasks can be performed; Pens may write a predetermined letter, vacuum cleaners may vacuum a room, and cars may drive towards a destination.  The GM decides what this Power may be capable of.  If the GM feels it is necessary, he may require a RC check for this Power.</blockquote>\nSalamandra = salamander= fire control.  Or more accurately, heat control, because this lets you manipulate temperature to create flames and ice.  I'm not very fond of this one, aside from one or two powers it's just a bread-and-butter combat suite without much else to spice it up.  Attacks all use RC.\n<blockquote>Ice Wall<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Auto<br/>Skill: RC Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range: Close<br/>Encroach: 5 Restrict: -<br/><br/>Declare after a character that is in the User's (Range: View) performs an attack check.  Perform a check, with the difficulty being the score of the preceding attack.  If the User's check succeeds, the attack automatically fails.  This Power can be used with (Timing: Reaction) Powers.  This Power can only be used while the User is in the Pre-Action state and will make the User enter Post-Action state once the check is complete.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Heat Perception<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Self Range: Close<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Be able to see heat.  The User will be able to see in the dark by seeing heat and can chase targets by following their trail of residual heat.  Lastly, the User can sense a person's emotions and changes in physical condition by detecting any changes in a target's body temperature.  If the GM feels it is necessary, he may require a Perception check for this Power.</blockquote>\nSolaris is named for the Stanislaw Lem novel about hallucinating scientists.  It manipulates the mind with pheromones and chemicals, and has an unusual skill spread-- almost all the attacks are based on RC or Negotiation, it has a number of RC-based ally buffs and heals, two different powers to revive people at 0 HP, and even lets you dodge with Negotiation.  It might be a little skeevy to go around roofieing everyone like a Batman villain, but I can't help but like this nutty Syndrome.\n<blockquote>Loose Tongue<br/>Max Level: 3 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: RC Difficulty: Opposed<br/>Target: Single Range: Close<br/>Encroach: 3 Restrict: -<br/><br/>Perform a Will Opposed check with the Target.  If the User wins, the Target must answer one of the User's questions.  The GM may forbid the use of this Power.  If he does, the User's Encroachment Rate and number of uses does not change.  This Power may be used (Level) times per Scenario.</blockquote>\nThere are a few powers with this conflict between statblock skill and rules text skill in the book; according to the translator, you actually have to make BOTH checks to make these powers work.  Along the same lines, unless otherwise specified, a ranged attack, healing effect, or boost power has a target of Single.  I can't actually find that anywhere in the book, but I'm willing to take his word for it.\n<blockquote>Childhood Friend<br/>Max Level: 1 Timing: Major<br/>Skill: - Difficulty: Auto<br/>Target: Single Range: View<br/>Encroach: - Restrict: -<br/><br/>Gain the Target's trust through the use of hallucinogens.  The drugs will confuse the person's cognition, making him believe the User is a trustworthy friend.  This Power can only affect non-Overeds.  If the GM feels it necessary, he may require a Negotiation check for this Power.</blockquote>\nOK, we're almost done with the book!  Next post will be the last, and likely the shortest, and I'll cover the sample adventures in the back-- not so much the events, but the GM advice and assumptions in them, which are pretty different than what I'm used to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425388/#Comment_425388" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-06T10:17:22+00:00" title="December  6, 2013 10:17AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So after entirely too much time off, I edited my posts here into a cheat sheet for my players and actually ran some Double Cross, specifically the intro adventure.<br/><br/>First off, and very germane to recent threads, it is very railroady.  I would actually call it downright theatrical-- Andy K likes to describe sessions of Tenra Bansho Zero as being like a stage play, but Double Cross' adventures really feel like it, it seems to go back and forth between treating the players as audience and actors.  The introductory "scenes" are really more boxed text to provide context for the players, but it also suggests they're meant to be fully played out at the table, despite there being very clear boundaries for PC action (like, the first scene in the game has a set end point regardless of what the PC does, and the second specifies that a specific PC will pass out as soon as he tries to do literally anything).  <br/><br/>The basic adventure skeleton goes Opening Phase (intro scenes), Middle Phase, Climax Phase. It's the middle where the PCs get to do things, but even so, the book lays out a general outline of:\n<blockquote><br/>-Player Characters will meet up with the other Player Characters.<br/>-The known threat will be investigated.<br/>-Any battles or introductions of new threats will happen.<br/></blockquote>\nThe adventures progress via scenes that get "unlocked" when players pass certain information rolls-- like, the PCs discover some sort of information and so the GM runs a "cutscene" showing the villains advancing their agenda or bickering among themselves, or the villains notice the PCs following their trail and send minions to dog them or show up for a skirmish (it's also worth noting there are several NPC-only powers in the book, "Instant Retreat" among them-- but it also specifies that Instant Retreat is only usable once per session, so it's kind of an indication that it's poor form for the bad guy to constantly evade the PCs' attempts to get them).  I also like that the game anticipates the "what happens if everyone fails their Gather Info roll?" issue-- the penalty for failing an Info roll is to end the scene, start a new one (with attendant increase in Encroachment) and let them roll again. So it's not an issue of "will the PCs defuse the bomb" but "how much stress will they be under while racing against the clock".<br/><br/>Another interesting thing is that the GM gets XP they can spend toward their own character; kind of a nice reminder that GMs like being on the other side of the screen too.  I guess the very entry-level campaign advice (and inherent one-shottiness) is meant to ease in players who might be a little gun-shy about running the whole shebang.<br/><br/>Overall, the adventures are very thorough, maybe even disconcertingly so.  It seems to assume that people picking up the book will be among the rawest of newbies, and lays out a step-by-step path and checklist for the session (complete with pregenerated characters and lots of handouts for the players).  I can actually kind of appreciate this, given that DX is a fairly complex game that rewards long-term investment in system mastery, but it does feel odd to me after spending the last decade plus playing games that are less crunchy and more open to player agency.  If nothing else it made for a good demo.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, the pregenerated characters do have some issues; two or three of them are, mechanically, not very interesting at all-- in a game intended to focus on cinematic action, two or three of the pregens are total support-buffers and healbots, and the game system doesn't really allow for them to even just drop the buffs on themselves and then go to town.   Along those lines, none of the characters have any of the utility Simple powers, so I gave one to everyone for free just so they wouldn't feel so monomanically kitted out for combat, and giving everyone that leeway to do weird stuff without cracking heads really seemed to give them room to breathe.<br/><br/>All that said, I'm used to most pregenerated characters being comically underpowered or mis-statted (based on years of playing White Wolf, though I don't recall D&amp;D/Pathfinder being any better), so it was a nice change to only have a few of them being trap options.  I also really really liked each character having their "ultimate combo" move pre-statted out so nobody had to count up how many dice they needed in mid-action (and really appreciated the adventure doing the same for the villains)... but on the other, you still need to vet those sheets a little because they don't list the crucial Resurrection power every PC has by default, or all the details of the individual powers (they do at least have page references, but rather than trade two books around between six people I just transcribed everyone's powers before the game), and they don't include the second page of character sheet that tracks important things like Encroachment Rate and Loises.<br/><br/>Speaking of Loises, everyone ended up with five apiece (three from character creation, one with another PC, and then another one tying them into the adventure), which meant that I was only able to work in maybe only two or three of them.  In a long-term game, or one with fewer players, it's probably a good tool for fleshing out the supporting cast, but in a one-shot with five players most of them were just wasted space (much like aspect bloat in some versions of FATE).<br/><br/>The characters were also just as glass-hammery as I expected; pretty much every hit the PCs took or dished out was either a one-hit kill or close to it, so fights sort of boil down to the number of "extra lives" characters have being their real life bar.  I'm not sure how I feel about this yet.  Armor also sort of feels like a vestigial rule, since there are plenty of powers that straight-up ignore it, and of the two villains, one of them had no armor at all but bought up about twice as many HP as anyone else, which seemed like the more effective way to go.<br/><br/>Overall, Double Cross seems to have some divided loyalties.  The GM material suggests a light, almost breezy game you can drop in and out of or run with relatively light prep, but it's coupled with a front-loaded, very crunchy and system-mastery-intensive set of combat-centric powers that demands a lot of long-term investment of player attention and XP to get the most out of.  I don't think just having a set of pregenerated characters at the front defuses this tension, but on the other hand the game might be borderline unplayable without them; it's been a very long time since I ran a game this crunchy, and even with them I had to do a fairly large amount of player-utility prep, a lot more than I've done in years.  I'm also not looking forward to statting up more villains on my own, but to be fair it looks less daunting than doing it in a total points-buy effects-based system like, say, Wild Talents.<br/><br/>Before running the game, I wasn't sure if I'd recommend it, but after doing it I'd have to give the thumbs-up; it's a little out of my crunch comfort zone (and it desperately, desperately needs better editing), but like Tenra it is an interesting glimpse into a different gaming culture and I like the things it does right enough to want to play more.  It's definitely less polished than Tenra, but it won me over anyway.

Aside from that though, it's only once you start trying to convert Master System stuff that things get tricky.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe" title="mostlyjoe"><img alt="mostlyjoe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/285/nVQ8MX37HELA3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mostlyjoe">mostlyjoe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426044/#Comment_426044" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-19T12:51:04+00:00" title="December 19, 2013 12:51PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man.

I'd love to hear from anyone else reading though, I've been waiting years for this to hit a wider audience, and it's especially interesting that it comes out so close to D&amp;D5; I think it's very fruitful to compare the two games' versions of class&amp;level-based fantasy adventure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437172/#Comment_437172" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-13T12:28:58+00:00" title="August 13, 2014 12:28PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I read the whole thing the day after it came out.

So I guess everyone gets fatigued by travel at more or less the same rate, but "strong/healthy/warrior" type characters can take more of a beating.  Concentrating vs spellcasting seems similar.  Yeah, in an absolute sense people with higher ratings lose more than people who aren't as good, but relative to one another it may work out?  Definitely need to see how it plays out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437306">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod" title="MacLeod"><img alt="MacLeod" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/734/nPH37A6Q7QKN7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MacLeod">MacLeod</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437306/#Comment_437306" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-14T15:03:31+00:00" title="August 14, 2014  3:03PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one thing that I am the most irked by is that the healer has to put in more work to restore a high HP character to full health than a lower HP character even after suffering the exact same effect. Maybe it isn't as big of a deal as I'm thinking!<br/><br/>I plan on playing Ryuutama as written initially but campaign after that I want to fiddle around with it for sure. Specifically I want to remove classes and just let folks pick Skills (create a bunch of new ones, too, of course).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
