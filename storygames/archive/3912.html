However, we the audience know that the organization really just wants the target neutralized and doesn't care if any of the operatives make it back. So, they choose operatives with histories with each other. Just before the mission starts, however, they 'block' that history from the operatives' minds, all the while knowing that the mission itself will break down the mental blocks in the operatives heads'. The best possible scenario is to have the operatives complete their mission, remember what they'd forgotten, and Tear Themselves Apart.<br/><br/>The players would decide on a setting and a mission and create characters. Gameplay would determine when revelations would be made, and either a dice roll or some card draws would help determine what kind of screwed up history the characters share. Gameplay would end when the mission is completed. A winner is determined if there is only one left standing. If more than one is left standing, then they fight to the death. The Game itself has won if all are dead after the mission is complete. Finally, if all die before the mission is complete, a sequel might be played if the players so desire. Fun!<br/><br/>The only other idea I have for now is what the characters would be like. A character would have five Features or Aspects, rated as such:<br/><br/>12 - Ultimate Badass Feature<br/>10 - Badass Feature<br/>8 - Pretty Damn Good Feature<br/>6 - Good Feature<br/>4 - Not so Good Feature<br/><br/>When playing the game, you start with a d12. You have to roll the rating of your Feature or below to succeed.<br/><br/>When a conflict starts, the player determines which Feature they will use to be successful. If they are successful, they take the Feature's rating in [Fallout]. If they fail, and aren't willing to accept the consequences, they have to move up the chart to another Feature. You then roll that Feature's rating in d6s - and for every point over that they succeed, they accumulate that amount of [Fallout].<br/><br/>[Fallout] is this thing that you accumulate which will either lead to Damage or Remembering.<br/><br/>That's all I have so far. Comments welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87800/#Comment_87800" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-13T11:46:13+00:00" title="August 13, 2007 11:46AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question: Will always getting [Fallout] no matter what kill participation?
