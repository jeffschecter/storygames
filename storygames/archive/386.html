                    Did anybody else see <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=19069.0" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> at the Forge?<br/><br/>These guys are fucking great.  I wish them all the luck in the world, and hope Dogs is being translated into Spanish, because that would be rad.  <br/><br/>Does anybody know what the Spanish-language RPG scene looks like these days?  I've seen a few games, but wonder what the translation and distribution possibilities (in both directions) are.  We hear a lot about the French, German and nordic scenes, but not so much about Spain, latin America, etc.<br/><br/>--J                </div>

                            Hi, :)<br/>
<br/>
Don't know so much about the Spanish scene, but I can tell you about Portugal.<br/>
<br/>
Every once in a while, someone says there should be an RPG in Portuguese, or at least, a translation of some kind, but when it gets attempted, it just reads silly.<br/>
<br/>
Someone translated The Pool recently, and they couldn't even come up with a decent translation of the word "Pool"...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                            In case you haven't seen it, I have encyclopedia entries relating to this, <br/>
RPG Entries by language (Spanish):<br/>
<br/>
http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/encyclopedia/bylanguage/Spanish.html<br/>
<br/>
RPG Company list by country (Spain): <br/>
<br/>
http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/companies/bycountry/Spain.html<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, I haven't seen RPGs coming out of Spanish-speaking South America, though there are a bunch produced in Brazil, it seems.  Overall, Spanish RPGs seem to tend towards the short and humorous compared to US and English games.                        </div>

                            Well, 10 years ago I was pretty aware of how the things were going here in Spain. Now it is more difficult for me to be accurate, since I was only playing once or twice a year with my old friends, to old games, until I discovered The Forge last summer, and become again interested in new RPGs.<br/>
<br/>
But these days I'm talking with people from the organization committee of the next Spanish national games-convention. Thus, I'm getting back in the saddle.<br/>
<br/>
In Spain we have most of the main-stream games translated, and really, they completely dominate the game-arena. On my old-times they were translated several years after being published in the states. Now, it seems now they are much quicker.<br/>
Look at the list of publishers in John's site. They translate not only the main game books, but modules and everything: D&amp;D series, CoC, Ars Magica, Vampire, Changelling, Star Wars, LotR, Big Eyes, ... almost everything.<br/>
<br/>
In general people in Spain do not read or play games published in other languages. Specially the young people who are the main audience for RPGs.<br/>
<br/>
The local production is also noticeable. We have our own spanish publishers and titles, some of them good games in the clasic style, and quite succesfull in the spanish market: I have discovered that Aquelarre (published in 1990, I think) is still in-print and being played!<br/>
Our publishers offer now a nice catalogue of spanish-produced games. For example, "Ediciones Sombra" has created a nice forum-based community for its Exo (science-fiction) and Comandos games.<br/>
Another example,  the novels of Arturo PÃƒÂ©rez-Reverte about "CapitÃƒÂ¡n Ala Triste"  generated a lot of attention in the market, and around four years ago they published a role-playing game with that setting, oriented to a far more general audience, which flooded the game market.<br/>
<br/>
About foreign indie-games: I have not yet located anyone who plays them. <br/>
Anyway, my contacts told me there are some "freaks" somewhere who play Baron Muchhausen and Puppetland.<br/>
<br/>
About local produced indie-games... they exist since the beginning of the hobby, in the 90s, but as John says they tend to be humorous, and not many people take them seriously (even their designers). Some of the games, especially when generated in the game-coventions by the people involved in the main publishing companies, evoluted to officially published games. But not so many people play to them, I think no one of the humorous games may compare its success to any of the non-humorous ones.<br/>
<br/>
Some days ago I located a new line of "alternative" games in a well-known spanish publisher web-site. The first title is a game with a spanish 17th century theater-like setting which looks to be not so far of the story-oriented ideas. At least it is the intent of the designers. I'm still waiting for it, and I will try to get in contact with the designers sooner or later.                        </div>
