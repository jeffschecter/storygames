They had just spent some time learning magic from Francis, the wizard who leads the village, and his fellow ratkin James. That's when the Maldorean army showed up.<br/><br/><b>Here are the main PCs:</b><br/>Squig, a goblin addicted to destroying things with Destruction magic.<br/>Armitage, an elf Zaru who seeks out Zu words even at the cost of others around him.<br/>Rose, an Ammeni thief who wants to help people and make a buck in the process.<br/><br/><b>The NPCs are:</b><br/>Francis, an albino ratkin wizard who uses telekinetic Three-Corner magic. He's the de facto leader of the village, with his litter mate James.<br/>James, a ratkin who is very protective of his village and who's learned a bit of magic from Francis.<br/>Alessis, the experienced commander of the Maldorean army.<br/>Vincento, Alessis' sergeant and a demolitions expert.<br/><br/><b>Here's the quick recap:</b><br/>The PCs were holed up in the ratkin village when the army appeared. The ratkin fled east over a bridge, until Vincento blew up the bridge. The PCs and most of the ratkin escaped, but Francis was captured. We ended the session with the ratkin and the PCs running deeper into the canyon, while the army camped in the village with their new prisoner.<br/><br/><b>The highlights:</b><br/>Armitage wanted to create a bridge with the word "wall/stop/stopping". I pointed out it was supposed to *stop* something, so he would only be able to do that if he jumped into the canyon and then said "wall" in mid-air to stop him from falling - and if he failed his Zu check he would fall into the canyon and take Harm. That was hilarious. :-) He agreed and was ready to do that, but then he added his other Zu word "runner/run/running" to create a wall for runners. We agreed that would qualify as a bridge and he wouldn't need to jump first.<br/><br/>My Key Scenes sang. They all got triggered, including "meeting the army leaders", "explosives blow someone up" and "Francis throws someone telekinetically". I loved those moments, and so did everyone else.<br/><br/><b>For the future:</b><br/>I'm not quite used to buying Keys on the fly. Looking back on it, there were a couple of moments where the PCs or NPCs motivations clearly changed, and I didn't buy (or encourage a player to buy) Keys to farm XP off those motivations. That's just a question of my own experience, I think.<br/><br/>I have a suggestion for the elf. Armitage the elf's Eternal Question is about collecting magic knowledge, and he has Key of Self to ignore requests for help. But he was helping the ratkin, even at risk to himself. I'm going to suggest to Geoff (Armitage's player) to buy off his Eternal Question, and use the advances to buy Key of Conscience and another Eternal Question, namely "Is it better to help yourself or help others?" Then he puts himself in situations where he has to choose between the two, and regardless of his choice two Keys will ping.<br/><br/>I'm a bit confused by the noun form of Zu. The rules say that anyone else in the scene can make a Resist check against Zu to prevent the creation of the object. But how does that play in the fiction? Is the resister staring at the Zu-speaker, concentrating? I'm unsure what that would look like.<br/><br/>Great times!

Ok, looked it up and read it and have an answer now:<br/><br/>Bringing something into being via <em>zu</em> is rewriting reality. It's not even that something comes into being: you've re-written reality so that it was already there. Anyone present who is observing what is happening can be a passive resister to this re-writing. They don't have to do anything fiction-wise except be, thereby making it harder to change reality.<br/><br/>In your game, feel free to make that more active: those in the know understand the nature of reality and can actively fight to keep it from changing around them.<br/><br/>Re-reading the text, it almost makes me wish it was always resisted, but I think that would have some unpleasant in-game effects.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415767/#Comment_415767" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T00:38:21+00:00" title="June  9, 2013 12:38AM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            About buying Keys: if tracking Keys for NPCs seems too much bother, don't do it.

Most of the time NPCs don't need to progress at all, though, as most of them are static by nature.<br/><br/>As for PCs, it seems to me that you don't want to get Keys for incidental one-off occasions. Better to hold Keys that concern the character's long-term nature and inclinations. (Yes, this is difficult for mercurial players who abhor having their character actually defined as a personality. I recommend a <i>Key of Mercurial Zanity</i> for those.)<br/><br/>Regarding Key Buyoffs, remember that a player doesn't have to do it just because they fulfill the condition.

He has such a force of character that the speaker can't focus enough to speak Zu properly.\n<blockquote>About buying Keys: if tracking Keys for NPCs seems too much bother, don't do it.

I found that the NPCs' Keys were helpful for giving them XP so they could grow during the session. But then, that's not their point, is it? It's the PCs who are supposed to do that. If NPCs need a different motivation I can still give them that, it just won't have the XP boost behind it. I'll have to consider that.<br/><br/>I'm really looking forward to our next session. The army has camped in the village and fortified its position. Meanwhile, James leads everyone to a clearing next to a hill, with abandoned catacombs built into the hill. He tries to convince the group to return to the village (key scene #1) to rescue Francis, while letting it slip that he's found pretty shiny things in the catacombs, and some of the PCs will want to explore to find them (key scene #2).<br/><br/>I've written the encamped army as a named group-character (which will require BDTP to destroy) for scene <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>. I've done the same thing for scene <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, by creating the catacombs as a named character with abilities and Secrets. I was inspired by TonyD's <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=21123.0" rel="nofollow">Bringing Down the Dungeon</a> for that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_415819">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/415819/#Comment_415819" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-09T13:54:47+00:00" title="June  9, 2013  1:54PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I didn't know anyone used Keys for NPCs.

The role of the NPCs is to interact with the PCs' Keys. The NPCs have motivations, which I could just as easily describe in words. But by encoding them in Keys, the NPCs also collect XP and advances. That allows me to change these NPCs dynamically (buying Secrets, Abilities...).<br/><br/>I could simplify things by either not giving NPCs any advances at all (removing the dynamic change completely), or giving them a fixed number of advances (e.g. one per session) rather than giving them XP through Keys. I don't know yet which makes the most sense, any thoughts?<br/><br/>On an unrelated note, I spoke to Pat, who plays Squig the goblin. He raised Squig's Destruction rank to 3, so he's maxed out the ability without risking Transcendence, and we talked about what he wants to do next. The way I see it, he'll play with Destruction 3 for a while, and then get bored with it. From there he can 1) boost it to 4 and prepare to Transcend, 2) boost it to 4 and buy Secret of the Bodhisattva (effectively meaning he's more likely to roll a 6), 3) start buying other abilities, taking him into other venues for conflict. I likened <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> to a barbarian who gets rank 3 in Axe-Wielding, and then becomes a barbarian king, so he stops killing people with his axe and he starts buying Sway and Orate.

And then: "Let me describe your life over the next three years a bit, let me see if I got this right." Enter a dialogue via narration, as is done in roleplaying games.<br/><br/>I don't know that pre-discussing the matter out of play would be of much use, except maybe talking about creative desires in the abstract.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417733/#Comment_417733" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-03T20:15:09+00:00" title="July  3, 2013  8:15PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great stuff.
