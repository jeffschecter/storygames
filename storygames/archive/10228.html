I thought it was uncontroversial that the player and the character were distinct, but some folks have been trying to argue the point. <br/><br/>In that other thread, I made this claim:\n<blockquote>Role-playing relies on the existence of the in-game fiction, the shared imagined space, the diegesis: these are different words for the same thing. It's not players making decisions, it's not characters making decisions, it's players making decisions on behalf of characters. Part of what goes on in role-playing is our appreciation (in the sense of understanding) of the characters we play not as extensions of ourselves but as fictional creations that we author/witness.</blockquote>\nto which I received a few (whispered) replies, which is too bad because they were no more derailing to the thread than anything else posted in it.\n<blockquote>What happens in game is what happens at the table.<br/>I don't believe in some Jungian shared imagined space.<br/>I think we can get pretty close, but what people envision is a complex thing.<br/>Fiction doesn't spring up from nothing, it comes from us.</blockquote>\nand\n<blockquote>I agree somewhat with your point (players and characters being separate), but what happens when the players see their characters as avatars of themselves and bring player conflict into the game? I know there's the "don't be a dick" rule, but there's no way to mechanically enforce that. I think.</blockquote>\nNow, I think it's clear that player and character are <i>entangled</i>, but they're not <i>identical</i>. In <a href="http://knutepunkt.laiv.org/2009/book/FaceAndFigurationInRPGPlay/" rel="nofollow">my article for the Knutepunkt 2009 book</a>, I tried to show that the process of play involves both social dynamics at the table as well as a negotiation of the "diegesis" (the in-game world) and that pretty sophisticated language use is brought to bear to make that happen.If you don't concede the existence of the fiction, then it becomes impossible to understand what happens at the table and how to regard it:<br/><br/>"Why are you mad at him?"<br/><br/>"He stabbed me in the face!"<br/><br/>"But you're not bleeding..."<br/><br/>"No, no, my character."<br/><br/>Which is the appropriate response?<br/><br/>* "Well, then, let's call the police!"<br/>* "Oh. So it didn't really happen, then."<br/>* "Gee, that was a shitty thing to do."<br/><br/>If you look at some of the old threads on the Forge about <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/reviews/30/" rel="nofollow">kpfs</a>, you'll see Ron Edwards talking about the distance between the character and the player, how the game builds on that difference to give you as player an appreciation of what it means to be a pathological loser, how the game turns out to be <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=9340.0" rel="nofollow">about mercy</a>. That's what I mean by a gap between player and character. I see it as being exactly the same as the relationship between the writer and the protagonist, or as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikhail_Bakhtin" rel="nofollow">Mikhail Bakhtin</a> would say, between the author and the hero. The author judges the hero as well as animating him or her.<br/><br/>But there is of course a counter-argument, and it stems from the observation that people who play role-playing games sometimes report coming to regard their "real" identities as enacted personae in the same way as their "imaginary" characters. See the <a href="http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/si.2004.27.3.333?cookieSet=1&amp;journalCode=si" rel="nofollow">Waskul and Lust (2004)</a> article I cite in the Knutepunkt book. <br/><br/>So it's an open question, but I know which side I come down on.

By that I mean getting down to the point where I'm feeling the emotions my character is feeling, and I'm simply reacting as my character would react, without thinking about it as an outsider. When done well with proper investment by your fellow players, the experience is intense and... just amazing.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut at the same time, you have to be able to keep a certain level of distance, or this becomes not fun, especially when the experiences are negative. In the situations you'll commonly experience in roleplaying games, you would want nothing bad to happen to you. You don't want to get hurt, or have your friends at risk. As audience, we thrill to these things. We want our characters to face adversity and overcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor instance.. I, as a Soldier in Iraq, face a small chance that I might have to shoot someone, that I might have to kill someone, or that I might be shot and killed. I do not ever want to be in a situation where either of those things could happen. Yet in a past Dogs in the Vineyard game, I had a character that I wanted to kill someone unintentionally, or because he was forced to it. I couldn't look forward to that outcome without a certain distance, but I wanted to experience it with the visceral immediacy of immersion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo..

Immersion seems like a red herring -- the term itself would be incoherent without the prior acknowledgement of the distinction in question. "I am totally immersed in being me right now!"<br/><br/>Similarly, you don't need a shared imagined space -- Jungian or otherwise -- for the fictional reality of your character to matter. My ideas about my character do not need to be shared to influence how I describe my character acting or reacting. "Fiction comes from us" is true, of course, but insofar as we hold it separate from other parts of our mind it can have an 'external' influence. The fiction we create can make demands on us, whether it be a fiction about a roleplaying game or a fiction about who we are as a person.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227330/#Comment_227330" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T14:41:38+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  2:41PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>Some of them are better people than me, some worse, and while all of them come out of me they have more to do with how I understand other people than how I define myself.</blockquote>\nTo know yourself is to know other people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227400/#Comment_227400" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-24T20:27:07+00:00" title="August 24, 2009  8:27PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenomouse</cite><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>When I was younger, however, a lot of my characters were pretty much power-fantasy avatar mini-mes wandering around creating havoc.</blockquote>I have yet to grow beyond this phase. :X<br/><br/>Weirdly, I don't think I have in some ways, either.

As long as you don't think "making a decision about what decision your character would make" is functionally identical to "making a decision" then you have allowed for the existence and influence of the fiction. Saying that 'my idea about my character as a fictional person influences the decisions I make about what he does in the fiction' is not the same thing as saying 'I have no responsibility for the decisions I make about the fiction.' The final responsibility -- and the actual decision itself -- obviously comes from the players at the table, but that doesn't mean they aren't making that decision with the demands of the fiction -- shared or otherwise -- in mind.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227443/#Comment_227443" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T01:57:35+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  1:57AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you ever woken up next to someone who says 'You were in my dream last night, being horrible to me, you bastard!'? That reminds me of this situation.<br/><br/>So, when I'm playing Gakanagok, and my character walks into Anna's character's hut where he's in bed with my character's wife, and I (Steve) say 'I think it's important for the tribe that you two have a child.', my own personal narrative (that of Steve) has become mixed up with the narrative of my character (Owl). I can see (in my mind's eye) the scene and from Anna's reaction I can see that of her character. And even though Gakanagok is a game where the meta-narrative is important and you're always flitting back and forth between the world, the character and the players, the narrative of my character becomes strong enough for it to register as one of my (Steve's) own.<br/><br/>The difficulties arise because not only do our characters owe their existance to multiple narrative threads distributed between several people who have come to some agreement about how to manage this, but also because our own selves exist as the priviliged parts of of many interwoven narrative threads (in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_Drafts_Model" rel="nofollow">Dennett</a> kind of way).<br/><br/>And just because you privilege one narrative over another, because you're immersing into your character, doesn't mean you can't also keep an eye on the meta things at the same time. You can be aware of the needs of the narrative and those of other players as well as getting real emotions from your fictitious character. So when through the game's system I (Steve) force Anna's character to be the father of my character's wife's child, I (Steve) get feedback from Anna about how this happens in the game fiction and what her character feels about this (a mixture of incredulity and refusal). I also know what Anna feels about this, which is not quite the same (more a kind of 'I'll get you, you bastard!', but in a nice way). But even with all the resistance from Anna and her character, it still happens because I won the conflict and little Om is born. I even use the consequences to make Anna's character love Om. And the group accepts this, and we move on to the next scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227445/#Comment_227445" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T01:58:31+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  1:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See now, I'm of the opinion that often, if not always, the fictional content has a reality of its own, separate from what you give it.<br/>\n<br/>\nYes, you make the decision for your character.. But the fact that the decision you make can feel wrong or right based on what "the character would do" means that there is something beyond your decision that exists. It's something I addressed in Mendel's Pawn -vs- Persona thread.. Sometimes, often, the character becomes a "real" person, and if you write/narrate actions that that person wouldn't do, then you've stopped playing that character, and started maneuvering a pawn.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis isn't an excuse to be a dick. It's an argument that playing your character as a dick is completely separate from you being a dick. I had a character in a City of Heroes roleplaying group who was constantly verbally abusive, lashing out and insulting other characters with fairly small amount of provocation. No one became angry because they realized that wasn't *me*, it was *him*. Many people actually liked the character, even when their characters did not. Had I suddenly started playing him as friendly and sensitive, it would have been 'wrong', and my fellow players would have disapproved.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy decisions were to create the character as he was, and then to continue playing him as he had demonstrated himself to be. Doing otherwise would have essentially killed the character I'd created, even if the graphical and mechanical representation of him carried on.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's some damage among gamers, I think, caused by people being dicks, but blaming their dickery on the character. This is not what I am talking about. That's pure pawn-pushing, disguised behind the idea of the character having reality of its own. Sometimes the damage may mean you mistake one for the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227448/#Comment_227448" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T03:14:53+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  3:14AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's see if I can make my claim more controversial, to see if there's any disagreement here, at all.<br><br>Roleplaying is a conversation, yeah? You're talking about stuff. Of course what you say is influenced by what has been said already. This is true in any conversation. Otherwise, it's just not a conversation. You can also talk about someone being a dick without you yourself being a dick. And you can be a dick in a conversation without talking about someone being a dick.<br><br>Your character is nothing more than a part of the stuff that's been said in the conversation so far. As such, it cannot make decisions, because parts of conversations cannot make decisions. Your character doing something that doesn't seem to jive with "her" "personality" is simply you switching opinions (about your character) in the middle of the conversation. This is enough to throw anybody off. How am I supposed to talk with you if you switch opinions all of a sudden? I can't have a decent discussion.<br><br>Do you all agree with the above?

Or when there's a very long gap in the conversation? What if your conversation is viewed by other people who don't directly take part, either during, or afterward?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn those situations, I claim that the character still exists, and actions contrary to their nature will feel wrong. Sometimes, some aspect of their nature will not have been established in the 'conversation', but certain choices will still feel wrong, or right, because those aspects of their nature have come to exist outside of the expressed fiction. I've seen instances where I've seen a character do something that was very inconsistent with their previous actions, but it still felt right, somehow, based on what I've perceived of the character's personality and values.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not claiming any sort of metaphysical thing, though that's certainly an idea that could be explored. I simply believe that our imaginations are not purely subject to our will. You ever try to not think about something? I mean, simply as a force of will, stop thinking about it, not by distracting yourself, or thinking of something else. It's damned hard. Whenever someone imagine's something, that something draws from more than the person's conscious mind, hence it becomes more. When you share that imagined thing with other people, either via discussion, writing, graphical art, or whatever, it takes on even more solidity. There will certainly be some variance in how the shared thing is perceived, but where they overlap is the greater part. It's the reason why fan fiction is so popular.. Because the characters didn't stop existing when the author got done writing. It's the reason why you have massive nerd-rage wars about celebrated characters when the author has them do something "against their nature".<br/>\n<br/>\nAhem.

All of the moral panic over D&amp;D in the 70s and 80s [edited to add, for Graham: here in America] can be attributed to "normal people" misunderstanding the nature of the entanglement of player and character: "They'll get out swords and start killing people in real life!"

For example, 2 people are mad at each other in real life, sit down to play, and then use their characters to passively aggressively harm each other. <br/><br/>That said, isn't one of the points of mechanics to push you to do things you normally wouldn't? Environment is also a powerful influence on behavior. If multiple people are doing things they normally wouldn't, and that's all reflected back at each other and reinforced, it can lead to a place where we are farther and farther from our normal every day selves. <br/><br/>Keith Johnstone in his book impro, p 152, mentions: "It's true that some actors will maintain that they always remain 'themselves' when they're acting, but how do they know? Improvisers who maintain that they're in a normal state of consciousness when they improvise often have unsuspected gaps in their memories which only emerge when you question them closely."

My goal in play is Immersion (Paul's first definition fits well: "The GM just described this really scary thing, and that scary thing scares ME (the player), therefore I know what my character is feeling. I'm immersed!"). The second is story. In some very real way I'm interested more in creating a false memory of situation, something which blurs the lines of reality and fiction. <br/><br/>As, medically, a schizophrenic, and, philosophically, a solipsist, this kind of play appeals to me both on an intrinsically therapeutic level, as well as building a strong level of empathy for other people and their filters in a way that simply interacting with their "character" that they play in real life simply can't satisfy. I don't see a practical difference in portraying yourself in real life (i.e. "just being myself, yo"), and portraying a character in an RPG. The ethical decisions are based entirely on the ethical conditions and survival buy-in. Not to touch on a weird spot, but our ethical buy-in as per real life is remarkably high, insomuch as we have but one life to live. Once we choose to simulate this level of ethical buy-in in a role playing forum, the decision to take the life of <i>anything</i> ought to, necessarily, fall under a far different category of rationale than slaying orcs for lootz; which is why I still believe Greg Costikyan's Violence RPG is so important for understanding those ethical quandaries as they relate to our perspectives of so-called "Real Life."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227536/#Comment_227536" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T08:55:41+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  8:55AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sociologist Gary Alan Fine in\xa0<i>Shared Fantasy</i> argues that role-players are better at "frame switching" than non-gamers. That is, they fluidly navigate the different levels of reality that exist in a role-playing game. When a gamer says "Do I get another chance?" the other gamers at the table usually know if he means I-player or I-character or something else. In fact, this ability to distinguish player and character is a necessary skill to play these games.<br/><br/>I think we readily switch frames when we play. We might use different cues to indicate the switch or we may not. I think I modulate or deepen my voice when I drop out of character as GM or player. <br/><br/>I also believe that our characters are, to some extent, us. I like Bill's definition of immersion as the narrowing of the distance between player and character. That's pretty simple and elegant, though I suspect we need to explore what the term "distance" really means. Worded that way, however, the definition implies that the character is -- or can be -- the player. It might be a mistake to assume that\xa0<i>a priori</i>. <br/><br/>My personal theory of character is that it is a mask. We wear many masks in our lifetime: different masks for work, school, home, church, and the bar. Am I the sum of the masks I wear, or is only the common intersection, the core, "me"? (Perhaps the real me is something altogether different, something entirely unknowable by anyone but me, and perhaps not even by me. That seems a useless definition, so I discard it.) Wearing a mask requires me to filter my perceptions about the world in a certain, consistent way. It requires me to filter and alter my reactions. These things need empathy.<br/><br/>When we come to the game table and play characters, we don masks. It is always us doing things. Of course, we have constructed a shared "reality" of the fiction that allows us to do things we could or would never do in our real lives: some not possible, some not ethical or moral. This shared frame lets us wear masks that are inaccessible, unacceptable, or impossible in our normal lives: the mean girl in high school, a righteous gun-toting priest, a blood-hungry elf assassin. To "play" a character means to wear that character's mask. The degree to which we internalize the mask's processes, I think, is "immersion."<br/><br/>At one extreme, the player has not internalized the mask process at all. Whenever the player makes a decision for the character, it is a distant thing. This could be pawn stance (doesn't even consider character motivation). The player uses no information about "what the character thinks" as input for decisions about the character's actions. There is no "character," as far as the player cares. When you play Monopoly or chess or RISK, you probably play this way. The problem with this extreme is that it seems to cease being a role-playing game. If there's zero connection between player and character, is it an RPG?<br/><br/>At the other extreme, the player and character are indistinguishable. You have to play "yourself" for this to be absolutely true, right? Though, I suppose a player could so totally wear the mask of a character that he ceases to remember being anything but the character -- this is a kind of clinical insanity, however, and is hardly common in gaming circles. At this extreme, play also ceases to be a role-playing game, I think. You need\xa0<i>some</i>\xa0distance so the player can enjoy the game, though I suppose one can argue that the enjoyment can come later in the remembering ("I was really an elf").<br/><br/>My problem with Luke's definition of an RPG is that it needlessly focuses on ethics (which is too narrow) and at the same time fails to include diegetic elements (in Big Model terms, the five pieces of Exploration), though it very vaguely implies them. It seems to me that the first part of his definition ("A game in which a player advocates the goals, priorities and survival (or doom) of a persona...") is sufficient, although the term "persona" seems so loaded as to almost complete the definition by itself: a game in which the player advocates a persona.

There are character cards, but no one is really putting on the Warlord or Merchant "mask," are they? If players do, and it's not pawn stance, then there's Character; if there are also Setting, Situation, Color, and System, I'd argue it's a role-playing game.<br/><br/>I played Dungeon! once or twice in the late Eighties. The main elements of Exploration seem to be there, but Character is weak. You're not advocating a persona. You're pushing an Elf or Wizard pawn around using different rules based on character class. It's pawn stance stuff. If players change stance during play to decrease the distance between player and character ("play a role"), then I'd argue they've drifted it to a role-playing game.<br/><br/>I guess I'm saying that "advocate a persona" means more to me than just making decisions in the game for a playing piece. When you move the thimble to Park Place and decide whether or not to buy it, that's not advocating a persona. You're advocating, but for yourself. There is no persona. Monopoly asks us to imagine that our board token represents some kind of character moving around a city, but there's no persona (a word which is almost synonymous with "mask"). Once we don the mask, then we are role-playing. If there are game elements for structuring play, then it's a role-playing game (and not some other role-playing activity like therapy or improv or make-believe).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227657/#Comment_227657" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-25T14:34:59+00:00" title="August 25, 2009  2:34PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I feel like this is a Peanuts cartoon.
