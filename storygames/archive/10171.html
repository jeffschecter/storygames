It's eloquent, funny, clever, and very pertinent about his current subject. Plus, the guy has manners that make listening to him feel like I'm a peer.<br/><br/>I put gaming podcasts in a different spot in my mind for some reason. I'm either in the mood to listen to gaming podcast, listen to a non-gaming podcast, or listen to music. So, it's pretty much impossible for me to put one category over the other.<br/><br/>That being said, my favorite gaming podcast to listen to right now is 2d6 Feet in a Random Direction. The main reason? These guys are fun to listen to, and I relate to them, or at least the way they perceive stuff.

I'm a jerk.<br/><br/>I used to listen to SoK in my SUPER-LONELY cube* at work when I lived in NYC, and that was in the days of "classic" SoK. Storn, after you joined, I listened less frequently, and in less-quiet environments, so the sounds of *only* Judd and Jeff's voices resound in my brain more intensely.<br/><br/>But I think many of the later three-way action (if I may) shows were the best of the lot. Once I got over my initial suspicion ("They changed it!") I enjoyed the new dynamic. <br/><br/>* Man, that cube sucked. It was a single cube in the center of a small office that contained no other cubes. So I'd walk down the hall, go into my windowless office, and sit in a cube in the middle of the windowless office.

Here they are:<br/><br/>I like Durham 3 for its format: talk gaming, break for play, come back and talk more gaming. A lot of the topical shows they did were very engaging. All three of them also have a lot of energy, so it's just really fun to listen to. I also like the musical intro (no joke).<br/><br/>I listen to Sons of Kryos if the topic is something of interest to me at the time. I think what I really like about it is you have these three people with very different personalities and mannerisms, but they all clearly love gaming and talking gaming, and it's fun to eavesdrop on that. Also, I live for the creepy "Sons of Kryos!" voice at the beginning. Awesome.<br/><br/>Robert Bohl's "Independent Insurgency" is on my radar after the Vincent Baker interview. Bohl had a kind of open-minded skepticism in the interview that I liked, and the resulting discussion made it easier for me to understand some of Baker's philosophy, which I sometimes find impenetrable.

It was a true shame I only came upon it months after they stopped airing it. I liked the mixture between theory, real life experiences, a chatty yet focused talk and intelligent toughs. Even while they were mainly used to mainstream games, their focus on LARP made them somewhat unique to my ears. I never felt it lasted for too long.<br/><br/>I also list among my favorites the <b>Sons of Kryos</b>. Pretty much for the same reasons that have been already said. Plus I could always emphasize with their viewpoint and experiences. The "Me too! I remember that happening to me/my group this one time..." moments are always fun.<br/><br/>For the theory stuff, I am starting to enjoy <b>Master Plan</b>. I'm just getting to listen to the first episodes, but so far I love the focused, well organized and practical talk. The guy is not just talking. He knows what he talks about, and it shows. I wouldn't mind a longer podcast, but I guess the focus and dynamic are part of its charm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226358/#Comment_226358" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T16:36:07+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  4:36PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone tried the two Ennie award winning efforts, Order 66 and All Games Considered?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226368">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226368/#Comment_226368" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T17:43:43+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  5:43PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>If you're a podcaster, do join in now, if you'd like to.

To many podcasts are 2-4 people rambling about random crap for 90 minutes.<br/><br/>Right now my favorite is definitely <b>That's How We Roll</b>. They've been having some audio problems that make it annoying to listen to at times, but Chris and Fred bring together fascinating insights about the retail and publishing sides of RPGs. There are a lot of other podcasts I enjoy, but none are quite as good as THWR at bringing something I can't get anywhere else.

They also have a very, very different style of gaming than I do. I was under the impression that podcast kinda faded away, though. Am I wrong?<br/><br/>I've also started listening to <b>The D6 Generation</b> because they do very in-depth analysis of board games. They have very long shows, and do several rant and comedy segments. It is one of the few podcasts that tries to be funny and yet doesn't offend me. They did a great episode a while back all about historical miniatures gaming and how it differs from other kinds of miniatures gaming, something I really didn't understand at the time but now have a good handle on, thanks to the podcast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/planetary" title="planetary"><img alt="planetary" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://whatarises.com/~jason/bokeh32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/planetary">planetary</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226602/#Comment_226602" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T19:25:01+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  7:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've chosen to take the approach of naming qualities that I affirmatively like, and qualities that I passionately dislike.<br/>\n<br/>\n(Some of these are a wee bit ranty, since I've just listened to like 20 different podcasts and hardly any of them have made the cut.  Sigh.  So much crap...)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy own favorite gaming podcasts...<br/>\n<br/>\n- are hosted by *interesting* people with a lot of gaming experience, ideally people with a little disagreement<br/>\n- are hosted by people with good social skills, so it's not like listening to an alpha gamer and his sidekick simply happy to be a "podcaster" now<br/>\n- understand the difference between entertainment and content, and focus on content<br/>\n- are generally 15-35 minutes in duration<br/>\n- don't waste my time with long music intros and outtros and fucking bumpers (the Durham 3 is awesome!)<br/>\n- don't waste my time by taking 5 minutes to tell me what they're about to tell me before the show *really* starts<br/>\n- avoid over-production (and instead focus just on information)<br/>\n- if the show has multiple sections, offer chapterized .aac versions so listeners can move around<br/>\n- have short but descriptive episode titles: ep # + a few words about the main topic<br/>\n- have good, but still brief, episode descriptions<br/>\n- have hosts who are confident enough to not talk about themselves, engage in histrionics, or are using this as a self-promotion vehicle for Internet Fame<br/>\n- don't sink into discussing their game fiction, as if I could possibly know or care<br/>\n- have websites with searchable episode contents<br/>\n- do not need forums; discussing at any of the regular gaming forums is fine<br/>\n- publish on iTunes and offer direct download from their websites<br/>\n- don't rehash the same Luke Crane or Fred Hicks interview ad nauseum (much as I enjoy these guys, if I hear one more person ask either of them how they got into gaming, or what their favorite character was, I'm going to throw my iPhone through the window)<br/>\n- stay on topic... STAY ON TOPIC!<br/>\n- have equipment to support reasonably good quality audio (doesn't need to be pro, but better than phones and both people equally loud, please?)<br/>\n- don't feel compelled to offer convention interviews from the show floor... these are often hectic and full of invective; instead, favor sit-down, thoughtful interviews (like Clyde's)<br/>\n- avoid inside jokes or stupid nerd humor, followed by 60 seconds in which the hosts are laughing at their jokes, and trying to one-up each other<br/>\n- only release episodes when they have something thoughtful to say, or actual content to release<br/>\n- have hosts who are at least somewhat articulate, and have reasons for their views besides "I just like|hate it"<br/>\n- are driven hard by hosts who know exactly what their show is about<br/>\n- are more than just recorded table chatter<br/>\n- have hosts who know better than to say "we'll put a link in the show notes"<br/>\n- and in fact do NOT need elaborate show notes; just a brief accounting of the topics.  for the rest, we have google<br/>\n- when interviewing someone, the hosts don't drift into a conversation with each other and ignore their guests<br/>\n- don't participate in the gaming podcaster echo chamber, trying to pass off podcasters talking to podcasters is content or something<br/>\n- do discuss current events and interesting threads on web forums and conventions<br/>\n- have discussions grounded in ACTUAL personal experience instead of what everyone says about that game<br/>\n- avoid the most annoying verbal tics of our hobby, like: making sweeping generalizations, overuse of the word "basically", using the word "um" to end a sentence, or laughing at your own joke to end a sentence, etc. grr!  :-)<br/>\n- stick to RPGs as their topic (mostly)<br/>\n- are not afraid to generate longer or different content, but don't include it in the main feed... or if they do, mark it as bonus content, not an actual episode<br/>\n- unless targeted at a young audience, do not bleep profanity<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, that's a good start.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nJason                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226609/#Comment_226609" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-21T20:24:31+00:00" title="August 21, 2009  8:24PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2009 8:24PM by Graham.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stay on topic, I agree with that.

What the hell are you doing?</blockquote>\nThe thing is ogg vorbis is a great open source audio codec that beats mp3 on every aspect. It's a shame that most mp3 players are ignoring it and won't improve their firmware. On a computer getting this codec is a no brainer. And also you can transcode files easily with a freeware tool like <a>mediacoder</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226642/#Comment_226642" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T05:55:08+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  5:55AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2009 5:55AM by shreyas.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Splendid Table had Joshua Bell on it once, and okay I'm a fanboy because once I heard him live and it kind of changed the way I thought about the violin, but he's also got this amazing speaking voice.

Let's see.<br/>\n<br/>\nGaming podcasts:<br/>\n- I really like the Durham 3; these guys are interesting, actually play, speak about it, try to figure out what's working and not working, and why, and don't include a lot of crap.  Nuts and bolts of play at the table.  You can tell that some of these guys are designers.<br/>\n- While it lived, I liked parts of the Sons of Kryos that were mainly Judd talking, or some of their interviews.  In particular, Judd really made this show good, because he was enthusiastic, informed, and kept topics concrete and engaging -- about what actually happened at the table, rather than the nerdcore trappings that many in the hobby fetishize.<br/>\n- I like the Independent Insurgency.  Good stuff, and it seems to remain what it was meant to be.<br/>\n- I really enjoy Clyde's interviews on Theory from the Closet.  He's at his best when he's sitting down with people and gets them to talk.  I like that it's a little more serious, and not the laugh-fests that so many other podcasts are.<br/>\n- Narrative Control is focused and enthusiastic and talks about great stuff, though I'd like less overhead (no "tell me what you're going to tell me" section, which gets repetitive).  Good chemistry between the two hosts.  Bonus for being NorCal local.  :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside of gaming:<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.sfbrp.com/" rel="nofollow">Science Fiction Book Review</a> - The reviewer has an interesting background (Brit living in Berlin, professional juggler), enthusiastically speaks his mind.<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.lenswork.com/lwpod.htm" rel="nofollow">LensWork</a> - A very short form podcast by a fine art photographer and publisher about art and creativity (and sometimes photography)... there are &gt; 550 episodes in the archives right now<br/>\n- This American Life - For the often compelling stories.

Listen for the sensory discussion and comparisons.<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.tampabay.com/podcasts/player/anteup/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">Ante Up Poker Podcast</a> - These two guys have gone on to make a more polished and snazzy podcast at a new feed, but this is very much two guys who work for a newspaper who like poker -- and are ok but not great -- talking about the game and their experiences at the table, and trying to learn how to get better.  Very enthusiastic, some great stories.  Watch for episodes with Mike Fasso, an occasional guest who's a real character.  The early episodes where they recorded in the newspaper break room (with noises in the background) are oddly fascinating.<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://unfetteredmind.org/audio/" rel="nofollow">Unfettered Mind</a> - About practical, pragmatic Buddhism by an American who studied in Tibet for years.<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://tennisconnected.com/home/tag/podcast" rel="nofollow">Tennis Connected</a> - Commentary on recent professioanal tennis by people who have played the game<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.awaretek.com/python/" rel="nofollow">Python 411</a> - About the Python programming language and community... the host is an enthusiastic hobbyist, which makes up for a lot, but this is not a show for professional programmers. :-)<br/>\n- <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/about/podcast/" rel="nofollow">Lake Wobegon podcast</a> - The newer episodes are generally not as good as those from 20 years ago, but I still like them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226820">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226820/#Comment_226820" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T16:58:10+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  4:58PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.cbc.ca/ageofpersuasion" rel="nofollow">The Age of Persuasion</a><br><br>Professional show with a great perspective on the art of marketing - primarily focused on the field of promotion &amp; advertising over the other three branches of marketing.

Tight and short being the best.  In gaming podcasts the most demand is for the 45-60 minute podcast.  So, you may not want longer podcasts but the vast majority of gaming podcast listeners do.<br>\n<br>\nAlso in gaming podcasts roughly half of the audience listens to you for personality and the other half for content.  And increasing your content does not tend to net you any more listeners, it simply costs you listeners.  <br>\n<br>\nYou (and I for that matter) may not like 3+ hour actual play podcasts, but they are extremely popular.  Much more popular than "content" shows.  <br>\n<br>\nYou may not like "in" jokes.  Lot of people like them, Good use of in jokes is an extremely potent drive for "super fans."  Super fans are themselves one of the best drives for popularity because they promote your show.<br>\n<br>\nYou may want podcasters to use external forums, but forums dislike outsiders.  And they (the gestalt of the forum) dislike people who have authority not derived from their community.  <br>\n<br>\nAbove all if you are interested in gaming podcasts go to rpgpodcasts.com for a complete list.  And if you have any questions ask a podcaster.  Now the bad news is that the particular type of person who is a podcaster is often a huge dick.  But the secret is that they are also all incredibly vain, so just lie to them and claim you love their show.  <br>\n<br>\nHere are a few form letters you can use:<br>\n<br>\nDear Ryan Macklin,<br>\nYour show, master plan, is a pinnacle of human achievement and regularly causes me to weep with joy.  I would like to commend you for your work.  Oh and as a side note <br>\n<br>\nDear Sean,<br>\nYou show, Narrative Control, is my favorite.  Sometimes I feel like you are my only friend,  How much longer are you going to keep that hack Justin around?  I turn down the volume whenever he speaks.  I was wondering <br>\n<br>\nDear Justin,<br>\nYou are the only reason I listen to Narrative Control.  Why do you continue to associate with that loser Sean.  He can't even spell his name correctly.  Would you please start dating my sister?  She is really easy.  And if you wouldn't mind <br>\n<br>\nDear Rob,<br>\nIndependent Insurgency is my favorite.  I hate "are you a werewolf."
