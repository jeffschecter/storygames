After several sessions of City and Character Creation, we finally have gotten a couple of sessions in where we actually play in an adventure. Unfortunately, we have discovered that FATE doesn't fit our style of play. Its simpler than most, but the thing is still crunchier than most of us like.. and I am finding some spots in it that are way too squishy. I still havent' gotten the hang of Thaumaturgy, for example.<br/><br/>The players seem to be enjoying themselves with the story, despite my rustiness. However, they are used to the Hippy style of game, so instead of dropping the campaign, I intend on retooling. The FATE books will provide me with the guidelines I need, but I need a Storytelling game instead of a traditional RPG with Storytelling elements added onto it. I'm not putting down FATE. Its just that its not working for my particular group.<br/><br/>So, I've started cobbling together a system from some bits and pieces that I've been mulling over the past few years. What I would like to know is what would You think would be Essential Storytelling Elements of the Dresden Style?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_299693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/299693/#Comment_299693" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-07T21:20:43+00:00" title="November  7, 2010  9:20PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a lot of success running Dresden even though I didn't ever finish even the first novel, because I read a FUCKTON of Dashiell Hammett.

You may destroy the monster, but you release a bigger one. You may break the door, but a piece sticks in your side. <br/><br/>One of my favorite elements of the Dresden books and something that I think will be a challenge to recreate is how Magic and physics interact. Though magic lets you do things that seem incredible, physics is still god. You can be able to toss cars around, but a guy who gets a good run going can still bulldog you to the ground and hold you there if he gets the right angle/leverage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300071/#Comment_300071" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T11:44:14+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 11:44AM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 11:44AM by Leonard Balsera.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Sears</cite>What I would like to know is what would You think would be Essential Storytelling Elements of the Dresden Style?</blockquote>\nWhat has been said above, plus a few things:<br/><br/>* Actions Have Consequences.

Soul gazes work this way except when;  you have to draw a circle and charge it to do such-and-such;  potions require X and Y;  demons are this way;  faeries are that way;  true names can be used to ...;  water impedes...<br/><br/>So any time player A wants to do something, some other player says something like, "Wait a minute, you can't soul-gaze a manticore, Dresden tried that in book 13 and ended up unconscious for a week."  No matter what rules system you use.<br/><br/>So the solution might not be Throw Away Fate but rather File The Serial Numbers Off:  "This is *our* urban fantasy and if we say you can soul-gaze a manticore, by God you can."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300165/#Comment_300165" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T16:50:01+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  4:50PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 7:38PM by Valamir.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie, a good guess, but in this case it was definitely the rules (I'm in Keith's group).<br/><br/>READING the rules I was totally psyched...wow...they totally captured everything so perfectly!  <br/>PLAYING the rules I was totally disappointed...wow...this is totally a pain in the ass.<br/><br/>I think, as Keith said, its more that I have developed an exceedingly low tolerance for fiddly, and much of the rest of our group never had much of a tolerance for fiddly, combined with the fact that alot of the fiddly in Dresden is of the "neat but unnecessary" variety.<br/><br/>Take Evocation for instance.<br/>FIRST you have to figure out how much power you want to throw around.  This is mostly simple...just match the number to the damage of a weapon and you do about that same amount of damage, but then there's little add ons for affecting multiple targets and effecting a zone and stuff.  Its not a huge list of stuff...but its a list of stuff...neat...but unnecessary.  Why can't blasting 3 people instead of just 1 just be color...making you pay extra for the privilege of attacking more than one target with a spell seems...old fashioned to me.<br/>THEN you have to compare that power level to your Conviction.  You're going to take mental stress from slinging the spell, but if the power goes over your Conviction you take extra.  BUT you can help yourself out with a magical implement that can increase your Conviction...or it can increase your Discipline, but only for either offensive or defensive spells not both.  And there are rules for how many of these devices you can create each with their own combination of bonuses.  Again neat but unnecessary.<br/>THEN you have to make a Discipline roll to score at least as much as the power you used, and if you don't you'll take fallout or else you could take blowback instead.<br/>And on top of that you can build these spells into rote spells which make them easier to cast.<br/><br/>And THAT'S just for one kind of spell.  Then you have to work out how the steps for veils work, or tracking spells, or this or that or the other...all of which follow the same basic framework (two seperate frameworks actually) but each of which is just more fiddly to figure out how to do.  Thaumaturgy is really annoying because after reading all the rules for it...what it really boils down to is "GM sets a target number that's either low or high...and then you roll 57 times until you accumulate the points you need"...or you just follow the side bar which says...don't bother rolling...which begs the question...why have all those rules in the first place if at the end of the day the GM just makes it all up anyway...<br/><br/>None of which is horribly complex.  But in the novels...Harry shouts "Fuego" and things burn.  So going through this whole thing was just irritating.  But then that's coming from a group that cast all kinds of spells of arcane nastiness In a Wicked Age without needing any of the crunch to do it.<br/><br/>And when you throw Aspects on top of all this...which reading about seems awesome, but using in play seems pointless...because this is the group that compelled the crap out of each other playing PTA without needing to be bribed with special power up tokens to do it...is just another layer of neat but unecessary.<br/><br/>So...pretty great game...but not really right for us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_300181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300181/#Comment_300181" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T19:15:07+00:00" title="November  9, 2010  7:15PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great Stuff Guys! Thank you. Your suggestions are helping.<br/><br/>As Ralph pointed out.. the "problem" is in the system. FATE is not a bad system by a long shot. However, the core goal of the system is to simulate the "reality" of Dresden's world, as any traditional RPG would. The problem with this is that the system then has to start defining things that a story will usually just blip over. In the game, you need to keep track of how much magical juice your wizard has. In a story, the wizard keeps firing off spells until the writer thinks it would be dramatic for him to start running out of mojo.<br/><br/>Our little group consists mostly of players that like to think like Writers. We want the excitement and drama without a lot of crunch. So, I am currently roughing out a system that will be able to act more like story creation rather than a simulated "reality."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300194/#Comment_300194" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-09T23:45:24+00:00" title="November  9, 2010 11:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2010 11:47PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited November 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Keith Sears</cite>So, I am currently roughing out a system that will be able to act more like story creation rather than a simulated "reality."</blockquote>\nI'd be really curious to see what Dresden would look like as a Hackbird, in addition to my suggestion above.<br/><br/>The Pool also comes to mind.

However, the stories are acting more like straight-up adventures and Dirty Secrets firmly supports the Noir/Mystery genre. Besides, we'd end up playing 3 seperate games at this point. Currently, we have 3 seperate protagonists each in their own little section of the overall adventure, and putting them together would be a Bad Idea. Currently, we have:<br/><br/>Dante (played by Ralph Mazza): A scion half-angel based on Danny Trejo's character Machete. Total biker, total badass, with a total disrespect for authority in all its forms - except his Mom. Currently acting as an agent for the Ghost Nuns of St. Francis and is currently being trained and equipped by Ian and Jewel Smith of the Concillium.

But, this seems different.</blockquote>\nIt's within topic as long as it concerns the Dresden Files.<br/><br/>One of the appeals of the game is the extremely flexible magic. Being a wizard can be very handy, but it doesn't make you all-powerful. Wizards call upon the power of Life to make their miracles happen. This means that the wizard is calling upon his personal energy reserves to to this. In the Dresden Files RPG. the magic-user takes damage to his Mental reserves in order to make things happen. He uses everything up.. he goes unconscious. He may end up even killing himself if he uses too much power.<br/><br/>In the stories, Dresden usually notes how tired he feels after pulling off a heavy-duty spell. Or he may be exhausted from too little sleep and having the crap beat out of him previously. Its all pretty much color text until he is in the middle of a fight and his head is swimming and his legs feel like rubber. He could have a spell go awry or he passes out, but he usually hangs on until the danger is over with.<br/><br/>Rule number 1 on Fiction: Fiction is Better Than Life.<br/>Fiction is more logical than reality. Everything fits together. Situations are more clear cut and designed to pull on your emotions.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, RPGs are usually designed to reflect some form of "Reality."<br/>RPGs are random. The players may get obssessed by something that has nothing to do with the main plot. You may run out of Hit Points while attempting to cross a five foot wide stream. (This one actually happened to my old group while playing D&amp;D 3.0.)<br/><br/>I don't know of any games that simulate running out of juice close to the end of the adventure. The game would either need to simulate the dramatic structure of a story to do so, or it would need to be an arbitrary judgement of the GM. The player would take some kind of penalty on his Magic, but would be rewarded for it in another way, for example.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300488">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300488/#Comment_300488" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-11T19:20:15+00:00" title="November 11, 2010  7:20PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: greatwolf</cite>And yeah, a Lady Blackbird hack could be cool.

The mechanic where you "fail to win" could be considered to be Isometric, but I was referring to the statement in Lady Blackbird that if the character doesn't make his or her roll, that the GM may inflict a condition like "wounded" on the character.<br/><br/>An  Isometric mechanic is one that has the players playing against the system itself, and not the GM. They are designed to take the GM out the role of an active antagonist while still providing a balanced force for the players to act against. The goal for this mechanic is to reduce the GM's workload while allowing him or to concentrate on the storytelling.<br/><br/>The challenge to using Isometrics in a Dresden Files setting is that Harry often ends up facing something or someone that is clearly able to squash him like a bug. Isometrics are supposed to provide a balanced encounter. However, I think I have a method of scaling things so that the players can experience those "wer'e screwed" moments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MrJamela" title="MrJamela"><img alt="MrJamela" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MrJamela">MrJamela</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300645/#Comment_300645" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-12T17:41:31+00:00" title="November 12, 2010  5:41PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Has anyone used the magic rules as written and NOT found it to be extremely disruptive in play?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me that in our game all narrative comes to a grinding halt every time either of the spell casters need to start figuring out a new spell.

I think we're going to start house-rulling them; it may not necessarily mirror the fiction but I'd rather have something a lot more playable than what's there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_300800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/300800/#Comment_300800" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-14T21:15:44+00:00" title="November 14, 2010  9:15PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We did pretty well with them.

Dresden has done the "fuego" gout of flame so many times he pretty much knows how to do it and how much to put into it and what it will cost him and what it will do without thinking of it. The more complex or off the cuff magic is when all the variables come in.<br/><br/>Again, if you don't like the underlying engine, that probably isn't going to be a solution.

Of course, that's directly limited by the amount of time any given person has to dedicate to the game when not actually sitting at the table to play.  <br/><br/>Which again isn't so much a good / bad design thing as it is a good / bad group-fit thing.<br/><br/>I did find it kind of strange from a rules presentation perspective that the large amount of "extra wizard prep" that is required to run a DresdenRPG wizard effectively wasn't actually emphasized (IIRC) in the game set-up character creation rules but was found by us, only later in the magic chapters.  Here I'm talking about things like creating Focii and choosing Rote Spells.  <br/><br/>A more complete spell list would also have been helpful.  Not only to take some of the pressure off of design your own Rotes, but also to put some setting flavor examples around what is possible with Dresden magic.  I think part of the problem we had with the magic system was that 1 of the wizards had read only 1 book and the other had read only a few...and the folks who had voraciously devoured them all chose to play non-wizards.  That created a few occassions of magical setting disconnect where spells that weren't very "Dresdenish" were proposed and thus difficult to parse.  For our group preferences I think we were perfectly happy with casting non Dresdenish spells (after all we only see a very narrow selection of wizards in the book, and all of them through the filter of how Harry does it) but the rules are very Dresdenish focused and thus much more difficult to figure out how to do other stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_301346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/301346/#Comment_301346" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-11-18T19:45:12+00:00" title="November 18, 2010  7:45PM">November 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After thinking about it for a while, I have come to the decision to base the new system on Unipool, a sort of fusion of Universalis and The Pool.

Keep in mind that this isn't going to be pure Unipool. I have some ideas that will make some significant changes in it.<br/><br/>The main consideration for my choice is taking into account my group. They are very creative souls, and love inventing stuff on the fly. Universalis has proven to be an exceptional game for this. However, I tend to be a bit of a traditionalist, and like having a GM in charge. The Pool makes use of this play structure while not binding up the players' creativity.<br/><br/>It also solves a number of problems we've had with the magic system. It allows for the Flash Bang magic of Evocation, while allowing the use of coins to build larger Thaumaturgic spells, magic items, etc.<br/><br/>It should also allow me to pursue some experimentation into Isometric Mechanics. I played around with some simulations and discovered that it may be possible for the GM to roll no dice at all. Instead, all the minuses rolled on the the players' fudge dice can be used by the GM to inflict damage, create a Fact, or give the GM a coin. Blanks would be considered to be a Mixed result. If a player tried to use a Blank as if it were a Plus, the GM would also be able to use the die as if it were a Minus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
