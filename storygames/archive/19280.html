Seems like a few things are still fairly buggy -- the game crashed on me once, scores don't persist from session to session, many of the special attacks don't seem to work, and unlocked starting cities also don't persist from session to session. Also, it would be nice if the main character could be a woman.<br/><br/>Still, it's a lot of fun! It's very engrossing -- playing one game (which took about five minutes) made me want to play several more, and the stories are very flavorful. Totally worth the $0.99.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_429496">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer" title="Dreamer"><img alt="Dreamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dreamer">Dreamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/429496/#Comment_429496" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-03-16T09:37:25+00:00" title="March 16, 2014  9:37AM">March 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 16, 2014 9:39AM by Dreamer.">edited March 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            it does seem to tell a bit of story, though I'm not sure if Barbarian Prince has more varied events since it isn't possible to look at all the events of this game to compare.\xa0<br/><br/>Looking at the score table though is a lot of fun, though. \xa0Here's the list of all the playthroughs I've had so far:<br/><br/><br/>Edik Wildcat, 29 days, 0 gold, defeated by a warlock and his demonic guard<br/><br/>Rodor Shadowstep, 18 days, 11 gold, killed by a reaver while trying to rescue that fool Rikkel<br/><br/>Kratos Eight-Eyes, 17 days, 15 gold, hacked to pieces by Skald the Red<br/><br/>Luter of Voni, 50 days, 19 gold, killed trying to free Spartic's family<br/><br/>Fredek Firehelm, 30 days, 22 gold, killed by a reaver while trying to rescue a terrified looking boy<br/><br/>Ljot Wilystep, 40 days, 45 gold, slain by a hapless villager during a raid on Gund<br/><br/>Vladik the Axe, 100 days, 47 gold, ran out of time<br/><br/>Nain Irondagger, 20 days, 57 gold, made into dessert by a pack of wild dogs<br/><br/>Strang the Butcher, 32 days, 94 gold, killed by guards trying to defend some peasants<br/><br/>Manglor of the Many Blades, 21 days, 109 gold, Slain by magically animated armor<br/><br/>Ljot the Sly, 34 days, 114 gold,\xa0Slain by magically animated armor<br/><br/>Sorab the Lean, 51 days, 236 gold, burned to ash by a great wyrm<br/><br/>Lucan the Ghost, 86 days, 271 gold, starved to death<br/><br/>Urtun of the Cold, 106 days, 310 gold, snapped in two by a massive dragon<br/><br/>Melchior the Cunning, 99 days, 525 gold, Crowned king<br/><br/>Rodor the Restless, 442 days, 1075 gold, Ascended as the avatar of Kor, the Sun God!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
