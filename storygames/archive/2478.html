                    So, the other evening I had the pleasure of leading a troupe through a short <a href="http://malcontent.sourdust.com/7L" rel="nofollow">Seven Leagues</a> game. I play infrequently with a group of indie-minded gamers, and there is no steady game night or "campaign"; we get together catch as catch can and play whatever happens to strike people's fancy. I'd been wanting to take Seven Leagues out for another spin with these players for a while; we've only played it together maybe 3 or 4 times.<br/><br/>I had prepared a one-page outline of the scenario, with vital stats and some very basic relationships sketched in. I was anticipating a fairly short evening, and no one was able (willing?) to CharGen ahead of time (I had provided the thematic hooks of "velvet" and "box", but that seemed too tenuous to the players). In general, I don't favor CharGen away from the group, but in this case I had suggested it partly for logistical reasons (not a lot of playing time available to begin with) and also as an experiment.<br/><br/>As a result, we started the evening by kicking around some character ideas. We briefly toyed with one of the players, Nick, playing Waldo Jeffers from the Velvet Underground song, â€œ<a href="http://www.musicsonglyrics.com/V/velvetundergroundlyrics/velvetundergroundthegiftlyrics.htm" rel="nofollow">The Gift</a>â€, in a Faerie afterlife (heâ€™s in a box in the song, and the songâ€™s by the Velvets). I thought that was brilliant, but Nick passed. Too bad. He ended up playing a box-inhabiting imp, who buys and sells sentiments. Also cool. Another Nick came up with a talking dog (boxer), bred for dogfighting, seeking the one small boy who had loved him. Aside from the power of speech, he could find anything. Finally, Mischa played the Laziest Man in the World. Unbelievable boons just fall in his lap, women are crazy for him.<br/><br/>All in all a pretty typical troupe of Protagonists, at least for this group. I must say Iâ€™m a little surprised at how long it takes for peeps to make characters in Seven Leagues (and I wrote it); once the concept is in place it takes about 10 minutes, but if the Muse ainâ€™t there, the concept can be a long time coming.<br/><br/>The playing got under way rather nicely; the dog had been unable to find his boy, but did catch a whiff of one of the boyâ€™s tin soldiers. He tracked it down to a small village church, and went into the confessional (velvet box), at which point he was whisked through the seat and into the Mortal Realm. He found himself on a stage, being presented to an applauding crowd by a stage magician in a top hat, monocle, (velvet-lined) cape. Then bam! back to Faerie. The imp and the lazy man each subsequently had a brief interlude in the Mortal realm, drawn there by the same stage magician. Turns out the stage magician has an unconscious link to Faerie, allowing him to perform amazing feats on stage by squirreling objects and people away there, then back again; heâ€™s sort of a living Kissing Point.<br/><br/>Upon their return to Faerie, the Protagonists quickly meet up and discover that theyâ€™ve each picked up a new Taboo, thanks to their disruptive visit to the Mortal realm. Lazy man turns invisible at random times, the imp has been cut in two (thoâ€™ unharmed), and the dogâ€™s coloration keeps changing. They meet a velvet rabbit who Explains All: recently, the Magician lost a duchessesâ€™ velvet glove whilst doing a trick, and more importantly the heirloom ring in the glove. A mere bauble in the Mortal Realm, the ring is a powerful and disruptive magic presence here in Faerie. It needs to be returned, but the Gourd King stole it from the rabbit.<br/><br/>Some obstacles later the Protagonists dealt with a sinister murder of crows and of course the Gourd King himself Given the make-up of the group, no fisticuffs, just some clever roleplaying and negotiations. Nick and Mischa carried on over tuppence for a while, and I think the imp-in-a-box had a great one-liner, something about "what's glove got to do with it?" Ultimately they returned the ring to the glove and the glove to a box, and sent it to its proper home after spreading a kerchief over it.<br/><br/>I think everyone enjoyed themselves; I was fairly satisfied. The prepared story was pretty linear, but given the wide narrative control Protagonists have in Seven Leagues, I didnâ€™t feel an intricately crafted plot would really be the point, nor true to the genre. I was a bit surprised that the players didnâ€™t use their Keywords more (I think if one hasnâ€™t read the rules all that carefully Keywords might be lost on one). On the other hand the mechanics are very simple, so there wasnâ€™t a lot of fumbling around on the playersâ€™ part trying to figure out how to make the game go. That said, rolling a lot of dice and looking things up on charts can be good props (as in crutch), good accessories--what Mischa calls â€œfiddly bitsâ€. Seven Leagues has almost none of that, itâ€™s almost pure narration, which can at times leave you feeling a bit, er, naked, you know?                </div>

                            Lovely tale!  I think what I like about it is that it's not pure "classic" fairy tale, it's a bit more gothic and vaguely unnerving, as in a lot of modern fairy tales (I'm thinking of Neil Gaiman, the stuff edited by Terry Windling, <i>The Books of Magic</i>, or <i>Fables</i>.)  <br/><br/>And yes, free-form system are often very daunting when you first approach them.  That feeling of not having a guardrail, you know...  I vividly remember my first encounters with systems that do not include a pre-set list of skills!                        </div>

                            The handful of 7L games we've played have all felt very non-traditional-Fairy-Tale. For instance, our first game had the Cockroach Queen, a tiny giant, and two members of a psudeo-Incan pantheon, plus someone else I can't recall. Definitely further along the contemporary weird-shit-o-meter than Hansel and Gretel. The comic <i>Fables</i> would run very nicely with the 7L engine.<br/><br/>In 7L, I think a play group can very easily paint itself into a corner in terms of group cohesion; more accurately, I think that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">each</span> member of the group can paint themselves into a separate corner. Hieronymous' decision to thematically link the PCs by using the phrase "velvet box" was pretty significant, more so than I thought at first. 7L has a lot of Develop-at-Start (are we still using that terminology these days?), requiring a lot of up-front thinking about a character and their place in the world. There's no sense in having a "party" of Fairy Tale characters, since there's generally no rich NPC to hire the characters to retrieve the McGuffin.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, thematically linked character creation can help solve the "why are we all together?" and "why do I care?" problems.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>

                            Nicely put, Rossum. It is true that in designing and play testing Seven Leagues, "why are we all together?" came up as one of the more persistent issues. I think that's exacerbated by the fact that there are few mechanical templates on which to build a character. Sure there are examples of Protagonists and Antagonists in the rules aplenty, but no classes or ready-made professions, or even races. That's deliberate of course; the last thing I wanted was every one to play the same old flavor of goblins and faeries.<br/><br/>As a result of this conundrum in the section on Troupes I tried to offer suggestions of some natural ways to resolve this that fit the context of "classic" fairy tales -- typically basing Protagonist affinity on kinship. The thematic affinity I employed in this particular Tale however is more consistent with modern "fairy tales", such as <i>Sandmand</i> or any number of magical realism stories, and I'm glad Anemone picked up on that.                        </div>

                            And you know, I think it would make a great sales pitch for a con game: evoke <i>Mirrormask</i>, <i>Labyrinth</i> and <i>Neverwhere</i> in the game description, and I bet the game fills up.  I think I'll try that either at Go Play NW in June or at Dragonflight in August.                        </div>

I suppose those are probably more broadly appealing than the <i>Mahabarata</i> or <i>Beowulf</i>.  And I'll look up the two cons you listed; thanks!                        </div>
