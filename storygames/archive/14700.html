You have to already be a decent chef to read a recipe.<br/>It occurred to me that board game rules are algorithms and rpg rules are recipes.<br/>"Make apocalypse world seem real", "Say yes or roll the dice" (which still leaves it in your chef's hands to decide when to say yes and when to roll the dice), "Kill the bastards" (which ones are bastards?), "Keep things moving" (how slow is too slow?) <br/>Does it have to be that way?

Solitaire is commonly considered just a time waster, I think. Candyland is decidedly a kid's activity, there's no gameplay. It's all about clever visual design and word puns.<br/><br/>I'm not sure about Monopoly. With the auction rule (which I believe is the official way) I'm not sure it's entirely algorithmic*. There's also a lot of Monopoly sold based on dressing it up with licensed elements (Star Wars, National Parks, etc.) <br/><br/>I don't know anything about Talisman.<br/><br/>Vegas games are played because there's money involved. You don't hear about many "just for fun" games of Blackjack.<br/><br/><br/><br/>*There are many games that you can create algorithms to play, but those algorithms are not guaranteed to play the best game or are based on heuristics. For example, Chess programs are based on looking ahead several moves (which humans can do, to a point) and some heuristics that not every human would play by. Go is an even better example, programs play at a low level at best.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334510">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/marknau" title="marknau"><img alt="marknau" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i24.photobucket.com/albums/c29/marknau/dwarf.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/marknau">marknau</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334510/#Comment_334510" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T13:46:08+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  1:46PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take is that there are many people who like seeing the algorithm play out, and enjoy it even more when they are helped to suspend disbelief and can buy into having "ownership" over the process.<br/><br/>For kids, Candyland and War are sufficient.<br/>For some adults, Solitaire is indeed engaging and fun.<br/><br/>I remember a boardgame from when I was in high-school. It was about sending WWII bomber teams out on missions. Everything was roll, consult chart, roll, consult chart. About the only meaningful user decision was which direction the ball turret gunner faced. The older guys I gamed with LOVED it. Drove me batty.<br/><br/>Peggle has a very thin slice of user input, one that is totally swamped by the random chaotic nonsense that happens after you've chosen. And yet people love watching all that nonsense play out.<br/><br/>Diablo is full of algorithmic decisions, and then a lot of window-dressing that doesn't really matter. You could train a 5-year-old to beat that game. Click this. Click this button too. Drink potions when these orbs get low. Run back home when you run out of potions. And yeah there's some outfitting and skill stuff, but the core game is mindless. And people love it.<br/><br/>Monopoly is 95% just watching the algorithm play out. Most popular board game ever.<br/><br/>It's also interesting to note how much more enjoyment many people get out of games of chance when we give illusory opportunities for player input. Like picking your own lottery numbers. Or hitting the button that tells the wheel when to stop. Or spinning the price-is-right wheel with your own hands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334511">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334511/#Comment_334511" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-14T14:03:13+00:00" title="July 14, 2011  2:03PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2011 2:03PM by Valamir.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: marknau</cite>I remember a boardgame from when I was in high-school.

The designer won't read your AP report and facepalm and say, "Damn, that's not the way I intended the game to play out at all." <br/><br/>Whereas if you're playing a game that instructs you to "Play NPC's with gusto" you might bring not enough, too much, or the wrong kind of gusto to the table, leaving the designer shaking his head wondering how his game got played so wrong.<br/><br/>And how to solve that - turn your game algorithmic (D&amp;D -&gt; Castle Ravenloft) so player creativity is unnecessary? Have more text? Spread the game virally, via oral tradition, the way we usually have? (I am suddenly imagining a game where you're not allowed to run it until you have been 'certified' by someone who knows how to run it.) Put a video on youtube, showing the game being played properly?

"When you go into danger" cannot be algorithmic, but "When you open the door..." or "When you attack an enemy within 5' with your ready weapon..."<br/>Depends on how you think about it, I suppose. I think of Castle Ravenloft as being all mediated cues but you could say it's a bunch of procedural cues and the fiction is just color.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334656/#Comment_334656" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T10:01:13+00:00" title="July 15, 2011 10:01AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>And how to solve that - turn your game algorithmic (D&amp;D -&gt; Castle Ravenloft) so player creativity is unnecessary? Have more text? Spread the game virally, via oral tradition, the way we usually have?

Or just live with it - embrace the fact that rpg's are recipes?</blockquote>\nI think a possible solution is for the algorithms to include feedback mechanisms that tell you if you're doing it right. A recipe that tells you to "bake until done, do not overbake" is one thing, and a recipe that tells you to "bake until a toothpick inserted into the center can be pulled out clean" is another. Sure, there's still some subjectivity, but less than in the recipe that presupposes lots of baking knowledge (you need to know what 'clean' means rather than 'overbaked'). I'm not sure I buy the bright-line distinction that this thread presupposes, to me it looks more like a spectrum. I think games can be made accessible to people that don't have a large knowledge base, it just requires good design and possibly easing other constraints (brevity, for example, might suffer).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334673/#Comment_334673" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T12:52:27+00:00" title="July 15, 2011 12:52PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like there is some splitting hairs even though there is a plain distinction.  Calilng for player choice isn't the same as the game <b>procedures</b> being algorithmic.  The rules of chess are algorithmic.  However, the rules don't tell you what piece to move.  <br/><br/>While there can be ambiguity in the rules for boardgames or card games, that isn't the same as the procedures being intentionally designed for judgment calls.  For example, Once Upon A Time requires that the story make sense as a fairy tale as part of the procedures of play.  That can't be programmed into a computer for the foreseeable future.  <br/><br/>It's worth noting that D&amp;D, Champions, and possibly other RPGs <b>have</b> been adapted into computer games.  However, the rules had to be changed in many cases for the computer to be able to operate as a moderator.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334682/#Comment_334682" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T14:07:42+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  2:07PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Basically, if you can turn it into algorythms, you can turn it into a computer game. However, player input can be handled in a way that could actually empower the interpretation of whatever you see in the screen. I'm recalling right now of an experiment done a few years ago with a chat bot. Basically you could chat with the program and it could use your own answers to turn it into a conversation, that it could even turn into a discussion if you went for the wrong expressions... because the program started to turn your own words against you.<br/><br/>I was wondering, if you could program that into the NPCs of a MMORPG, add some quirks and a good battle AI... you could have a really interesting game. It would be though to do it for a tabletop game, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334698/#Comment_334698" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-15T15:23:00+00:00" title="July 15, 2011  3:23PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a difference between the rules of the game being algorithmic and the player/GM's decisions being algorithmic. In some of the more combat-oriented D&amp;D games the player's actions are basically down to an algorithm, more or less. There's room for strategy and alternate approaches that the players can choose between, so you still get fun. However when some of those get cut off (say, magic doesn't work) it can turn into a pure math game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
