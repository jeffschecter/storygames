This is the thread where I say: "People who know of these games, <b>why should people pay attention to this game here?</b>  What makes it fun?  What does it do that is innovative and cool?  Why should I be eager to play it?"<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example, I've heard of "Transantiago" a couple of times: it seems to be sort of a magical realist thingy, where you construct subway lines to get to new scenes or something.  I DL'd the rules a few weeks ago but haven't had time to read them.  A few people seem to be really excited about it: why?  Likewise, everyone is foaming at the mouth over "Sign In Stranger," but why? what's it do?<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's a list from that thread, though I imagine there are a lot of other, less publicized games that deserve attention too -- feel free to mention them as well.\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">City of the Moon<br/>\nFingers on the Firmament<br/>\nHeart of the Rose<br/>\nIn a Land Called...<br/>\nIn a Wicked Age<br/>\nLand of 1000 Kings<br/>\nSign in Stranger<br/>\nStranger Things<br/>\nTenra Bansho<br/>\nTree's Heart Dynasty</div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_112344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/112344/#Comment_112344" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-06T10:29:18+00:00" title="December  6, 2007 10:29AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 6, 2007 10:31AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clinton talks about <i>Sign in Stranger</i> <a href="http://rpgheretic.wordpress.com/2007/10/25/game-report-sign-in-stranger/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.

There were also vague requirements that would lead to framing sex or death, but those were never as baked.  These rules are about 40% done.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/avatar/" rel="nofollow">the Avatar game</a>:</b>Does something similar, but each character has their own board (chakra) based on the four elements.  Each element represents a different attitude, so characters can have multiple different attitudes but still be in the same scene together.  At the end of a scene, characters move to a different element / attitude based on what happened in the scene.  There is no conflict resolution in Avatar, just narration that causes situation (and, eventually, traits) to develop.  We've playtested it a bunch, but it's not 100%, more like 75%.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/giger/" rel="nofollow">Geiger Counter</a>:</b>Geiger Counter is 90% done in my head but only 70% done in this current draft.  As in<i>Good Ship Revenge</i>, each player has a token that moves around a board, but, in this case, the board is made up of a series of locations written on index cards and characters are free to move between them however it makes logical sense.  On your turn, you frame a scene for<i>characters other than your own</i>, usually by picking a set of characters and a location.  There is conflict resolution in Geiger Counter, since it's a survival horror game where the characters are gradually killed off by a deadly menace.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/mwaantaangaand/" rel="nofollow">Mwaantaangaand</a>:</b>Unlike the others, Mwaantaangaand has not been playtested, but the current draft is probably 75% or so.  Definitely playable, just not tested.  Like Avatar, there is a circular chakra board.  Unlike Avatar, all the characters have pieces that move around the same board. A character's proximity to the "hearth fire" circle at the center of the board indicates the amount of narrative complications other players can inject into their scenes and conflicts.  Character pieces often have to choose to go "around" other pieces by moving to a ring closer or further away from the "hearth fire," which leads to shifts in narrative control.  Monsters in Mwaantaangaand take the form of alterations to the meaning of certain swaths of the board and are beaten after a certain number of scenes have been framed using their altered meanings.  This is probably the most complicated version of "board game style framing" that I've seen yet.  There is not really conflict resolution in Mwaantaangaand either, just "conflict endurance," if that makes sense.  You endure a monster's presence, and its detrimental effects on your character, until you defeat it.<br/><br/><b><a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/transantiago/" rel="nofollow">Transantiago</a>:</b>This one is different from the others because the board is created by the movement of the players pawns, so it's different every game and evolves over time.  Each space on the board represents an actual location, like in Geiger Counter, so scenes are framed based on the location and whatever characters are there.  During scenes, the characters in the scene narrate their actions and the other players narrate the surrounding environment and how it responds to player actions.  There is no conflict resolution here either, but instead of the "conflict endurance" of Mwaantaangaand, characters are actively trying to push the situation towards some sort of end state, forcing it to develop based on their actions until it reaches catharsis.  When all the locations have been resolved in this fashion, the game ends.<br/><br/>There are a few others I could talk about too, like Heavenly Kingdoms, Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan and Waiting / Tea, but those don't really have scenes or scene framing.  They do all have non-traditional conflict resolution (or no conflict resolution), though. </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113140/#Comment_113140" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T13:13:51+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  1:13PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite><b>Stranger Things and Tenra Bansho</b>I'll post later (busy day)</blockquote>\n<b>Stranger Things</b>:<br/><br/>We played this one about... 2 years ago? Clinton ran it for me and another player. Here's what I liked about it, based on far memories of long ago:<br/>- Character generation was really fun. You wrote down dream figments and stuff, and sort of defined your character and their purpose in one go.<br/>- Scenario generation was the coolest fucking thing in the world of gaming today: You've got about two dozen of these square tiles, and you uncover them a few at a time, and make a map out of them, assembling them like a rorshark puzzle. The buildings that appear on the tiles naturally fire off the brain, and the places (and then the people inside them, the connections they form). It's like watching situation bloom like a 9-petal lotus flower. <br/>- The setting was pretty much like a cross between Planescape's Sigil, and the City from Thief. <br/>- I love the mix of the players being half human, half demon. That mix appeals to me more than the original Trollbabes.<br/>- We only played a one-shot to test the system out, but I seriously wanted it to go on for 5-9 sessions. I'm hoping to do that when the game eventually gets released.<br/><br/><b>Tenra Bensho</b><br/>This one is the one I'm translating, so take what you hear with a grain of salt:<br/>- It's the first game that was really developed with Japanese sensibilities.  I mean that in terms of the setting, which has all sorts of anime-themed madness, but also had its own goals that other games, translated and relased in Japan, didn't have, like:<br/>-- Easy for newbies to get in and play.<br/>-- A play structure modeled after kabuki theater, with scenes and acts, intermissions and a "chorus" calling out the preview of the next act.<br/>-- A play structure that creates a complete campaign from start to finish in one single play session. In the author's mind, it's clear that it was one 5-6 hour session with no more than one GM and 4 players, but still a (roughly) six hour game.<br/>-- Mechanics to drive the drama, not just the success and failure of the charcters' actions.<br/>- The original Tenra came out in 96/97, Tenra Bansho Zero (the one I'm modeling the English release upon) in 2000... and even though it was years before the Forge-style "rules for story stuff" influences, it's there. You have 1/2 of the charcater sheet dedicated to attributes, skills, weapons, etc. And the other half is dedicated, essentially, to "spiritual attribute" style things like goals, emotions, relationships, etc. And that is actually the "more important part".<br/>- You get a cookie for good roleplaying, in the form of a chit or a chip. Stock them up, and they convert into high power awesomeness.  Like, normally for actions you roll between 4-9 d6es, looking for successes.  If you save up your wad for the endgame, you can end up rolling 100 dice on that final sword swing against an impossible enemy.<br/>- You say when your character dies. You check off a "death box" when you want to hulk out, but leave yourself vulnerable to dying.<br/>- When you min-max the spiritual-attribute-like system for maximum in-play advantage (to get the fat bonuses, to prevent becoming a dark jedi-like figure, etc)... it tweaks the story in really cool ways that don't break anything. I haven't seen this ever Not Work.<br/>- Also, there's the fact that it's seeped in Buddhism, Shinto and the like. I haven't yet, but I'm dying to run a peaceful all Buddhist monk game (and not even the monks with the Street Fighter/Fist of the North Star kung fu monk abilities).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113198">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113198/#Comment_113198" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-09T21:22:19+00:00" title="December  9, 2007  9:22PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Bacchanal deserves more attention (especially more actual<i>play</i>)</blockquote>\nIf people don't start playing Bacchanal I'm going to be forced to design a sequel.<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113363/#Comment_113363" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-10T13:30:30+00:00" title="December 10, 2007  1:30PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>If people don't start playing Bacchanal I'm going to be forced to design a sequel.</blockquote>\nI nominate the title, "Vomitorium."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_113533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113533/#Comment_113533" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T09:12:44+00:00" title="December 11, 2007  9:12AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, call it <i>Studio 54</i>--using hard drugs instead of alcohol--to take it about 2000 years into the "future" (our past).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_113603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/113603/#Comment_113603" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-11T12:16:17+00:00" title="December 11, 2007 12:16PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So - Bacchanal is nifty because of the subject matter, and if I weren't such a prude I'd play it.

They are mainly Swedes, but there are also Danish and Finnish members. Doubt is one of their scenarios (as the games usually are called) and is written by two of the members. <br/><br/>Check them out at jeepen.org.
