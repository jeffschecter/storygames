Perfect is a vague, hard to define word.  I'm not sure why I've used it here, but I have.  <br/><br/>I'm just going to write a bunch of ideas down, and probably never do anything with them, but that's what the internet is for.<br/><br/>I love Keys, but hate Refreshment.  It feels forced and... it just doesn't feel right.  It doesn't feel right to me in FATE either.  I'm not going to apologize a lot and write things like "it's probably me and not you", but it might be me and not you TSoY.<br/>So, I would like Keys to be but pieces to a character's Arc.  Characters would have Keys in the waiting.  Like Luke would have(amongst others)Key of the Student, but in the waiting he would have Key of the Hero and maybe Key of the Teacher.  <br/><br/>Also, I think Keys giving XP is lame-ass.  I think experience is harder earned then that, that's why I think XP should solely come from taking Harm.  Keys will act as Refreshment, and maybe unlock different Secrets?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433941">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS" title="L.Trenti MrVALIS"><img alt="L.Trenti MrVALIS" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/372/n6DOEFUWMI7ZW.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/L.Trenti%20MrVALIS">L.Trenti MrVALIS</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433941/#Comment_433941" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T04:15:32+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  4:15AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh dear.

So pinging Keys gives back Pool points, taking Harm gives xp, and Keys are grouped into Character Arcs through which characters advance. I don't see any major issues with any of these, except perhaps that if you give Pool for action instead of inaction (as the Refreshment thing does), then that will cause many situations where characters are simultaneously expending and gaining Pool; this might or might not be a pleasing dynamic, personally I dislike the way it blurs the process.<br/><br/>These are otherwise relatively straightforward, but perhaps we could elaborate a bit on the Character Arcs - how they work specifically, that is. My first thought is that the players would arrange e.g tripartite Key arcs for their characters in chargen, with each character having 1-3 arcs to begin with depending on how the player construes of their character - so business as usual, except instead of a single Key you define a group of three Keys at once. I struggle, however, with making this actually matter in any way; the system as it already exists implies follow-up Keys, so writing them down seems like it's just pre-writing character development you can't really know will occur. It seems like an amusing idea at first glance, sort of like Primetime Adventures season arcs, but the actual benefit is slipping through my fingers.<br/><br/>Hmm, maybe at the end of character generation each other player in the group will name a single Key that is "in waiting" for your character, and when you get new Keys, you have to choose from among that list of possibilities (which is obviously refreshed later on somehow). So instead of perceiving logical dramatic arcs in advance, we instead query the group mind to see what sorts of opportunities and possibilities the given character inspires in them. That sounds like a more interesting take on the concept of Keys in waiting, or what do you think? I certainly like to limit access to Keys in various ways in different campaigns.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433961/#Comment_433961" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T09:32:32+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  9:32AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>Keys open up Secrets too(along with refilling Pools), maybe through buy-off, maybe through just having them?  Maybe both?  <br/><br/>I understand what you're saying about Refreshment thru direct action, versus indirect action.  I'd be just as happy to get rid of Refreshment as written.  It's bumpy.  It feels like a rushed fix instead of really dissecting where the problem comes from.<br/><br/>So, you expend Pool to help improve rolls and power some Secrets.  I don't quite see how this would blur.  I mean, it might. I just don't see it from here.   <br/><br/>I've thought of making Keys the Pools, instead of Instinct, Vigor and Reason.  And just have Abilities without their inherent connections to Pools.<br/><br/>I think having an "in waiting" Key points to a direction for roleplay.  Maybe Keys could be branching during buy-off?   So, you buy-off a Key, you get a totally new Pool/Key all filled-up. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433962/#Comment_433962" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T09:49:43+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  9:49AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like Refreshment, it's the opposite of bumpy to me: a rule that encourages quiet scenes in between acts of the story is quite useful for me. I like the draw rule of MLwM and the folding rule of Dust Devils for the same reason, they all act to delay resolution and thus pace events in an interesting way the players would not have chosen without the influence of the rules system.<br/><br/>That's not to say that I'm necessarily sold on the SS conceit that the role of the quiet scene in between acts is to refresh the mechanical resources. Maybe, maybe not.<br/><br/>But anyway, yes, removing Pools makes sense for your purposes. So you have Keys, each with a certain amount of "charge", and this charge can be expended for mechanical effectiveness, and increased when the Key conditions are fulfilled. You need to have at least 5 points of charge in a Key to do the Buyoff, which in turn gives 5 experience points (the only way for Keys to provide xp in this hack). Also, if the charge in a given Key ever gets up to 10 points, the SG will get more aggressive about offering scenes that enable Buyoff - sort of, the existence of a high amount of charge in the Key directly influences the direction of the campaign, prioritizing events that lead towards the conclusion of that Key's story arc.<br/><br/>For measuring charge, I suggest that Keys have two kinds of charging situations: a "minor" charge is worth 1 point, and relatively easy to achieve in any appropriate scene. A "major" charge is a more dramatic event, during which each player at the table may opt to throw in one point of charge. The SG declares when a scene counts as "major" for a given Key, but the players each decide themselves whether they agree by contributing charge to the Key.<br/><br/>You should keep Pool spend caps, so that a character can still only spend at most one point per roll per Key (so could sometimes spend more than one point, if several Keys are relevant to a situation).<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433965/#Comment_433965" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T10:21:06+00:00" title="June 17, 2014 10:21AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I have to disagree!

My immediate reactions are similar to the above:<br/><br/>I think Refreshment scenes are one of the rather special things about TSoY which make the game unique and flavourful. (Although I could see them falling totally flat with a group of players who just don't understand the dramatic significance of a refreshment scene, but rather see it is a hoop to jump through.)<br/><br/>Having Keys in waiting seems pretty pointless. It's pretty much how the game works anyway, and I don't see much benefit in nailing down from the beginning which way a character is going to develop.<br/><br/>For instance, it's really fun to have a character be betrayed by someone they Love. They buyoff that Key, and now must decide how they will handle this situation. Do they replace it with a Key which means they give up on this relationship altogether? Maybe they buy the Key of Wanderlust, showing us that the character is so traumatized by this betrayal that they want to sever all human ties for now and leave this place. Or do they want revenge, buying the Key of Vengeance? Or perhaps they decide that they hate everything this person stood for, and buy a general Key of Being Against All People of that Nationality (or race, or whatever). <br/><br/>And yet... maybe they will be heartbroken but unwilling to give up hope, so they buy the Key of Unrequited Love or Key of the Masochist (which would need to be rewritten for this purpose, granted).<br/><br/>This is a very interesting choice, and I don't see what would be gained by setting it in stone before-the-fact.<br/><br/>I very much like the idea of Keys being repurposed to give bonus dice instead, however. Vigor/Instinct/Reason is a neat breakdown, but it also seems somewhat "simulationist" in contrast to the rest of the system. I could see changing the Pools to something like IaWA's stats  ("with love, with violence, for myself, for others, directly, covertly") and have them recharge via Key hits.<br/><br/>And then maybe your XP gain from Key buyoff is equal to however many Pool dice that Key has earned you thus far?<br/><br/>That sounds interesting to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433976/#Comment_433976" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T15:09:14+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  3:09PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here are my own gripes with SS/TSoY, partially related to Pool refreshment:<br/><br/>1. The way Pool dice are exhausted in conflicts can sometimes run up against the dramatic events of the fiction. You've got a climactic showdown happening in the story, but the character is out of Pool dice. Does this mean that they are resigned to likely failure (i.e. it's not time yet for this character to prevail, unless they have a chance to refresh somehow in-media-res - a good use of flashbacks!), or is there another interpretation of this?<br/><br/>2. It's very hard to judge how many Pool dice the opposition/NPCs should have, and how quickly they should regain them. This seems like a point which could be improved. (For example, Eero has some good guidelines on how many Pool dice NPCs should get, but if an NPC spends two of them, and then you meet them again for coffee a week later - which also happens to the be the very next scene of the game - should they have regained them, or not yet?)<br/><br/>3. The idea behind the rules for Bringing Down the Pain is at least in part so that a plucky hero can fail a roll against the nasty villain and then expend resources to reverse that, pulling off a dramatic victory.<br/><br/>However, in practice, Bringing Down the Pain is only really a good idea when you've got the upper hand mechanically, but you lost the initial roll - in other words, when <i>you're</i> the villain, and your opponent is the underdog. This seems unsatisfying dramatically: we don't need to "zoom in" on those moments, they're not dramatically important! It seems to me that Bringing Down the Pain should be something that evens the playing field a little more, giving the underdog a chance to win after all, but at great risk or cost.<br/><br/>In practice, however, it seems to me that extending a conflict just benefits the person with the better "stats" in the conflict, since over multiple rolls their luck will even out.<br/><br/><br/>(I'll note that Eero's rules for Effects mitigate a lot of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> for me, so that's nice. Eero, if you have other thoughts on these topics, I'd love to hear them! I suspect the way you navigate <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> has a lot do with the declaration of intentions, for example.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433978/#Comment_433978" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T15:55:15+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  3:55PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I do about the BDtP feature you mention is that I accept it as the way things should be <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> That is, the point of BDtP is not to reverse the odds, it is to even the fortune. As you say, BDtP only makes sense for you if you actually have the odds on your side mechanically, and the initial conflict check just happened to go against you out of bad luck. It would also make sense if you're desperate and failure is not an option, of course.<br/><br/>(Note that there are other mechanical elements in the game that do favour heroes against villains, even if BDtP per se is not one of those. Probably the most important is the fact that the hero is very likely playing for higher personal stakes, and is therefore willing to risk and sacrifice more than the villain. The hero also generally simply has better stats due to having been a focus of attention throughout the campaign.)<br/><br/>You could indeed revise the dramatic thinking that's going on here by stating instead that heroes should win, and PCs are heroes, and therefore a PC should always win all important conflicts (perhaps for a cost). Many games basically think in these terms. TSoY, though, is agnostic about heroism, and it's one of those Forgite games that basically doesn't play favourites for the PCs - they follow the same rules that everybody else does, and if they can't hack it, then too bad for them.<br/><br/>(That's of course not entirely true, PCs have advantages on their side: dramatic coordination and the one-sided player ability to call for BDtP are two such. However, the ethos is basically that PCs don't have any special advantages just for being PCs, even if players might have some few structural powers for the sake of being, you know, the creators and audience of the drama. You might use your powers to advantage your character, but that's your choice.)<br/><br/>My advice about running out of Pool at inopportune moments and losing conflicts you should've won is that you should be more self-aware about what "inopportune" and "should have" reveal about your train of thought: why was this a situation where the conflict "should" have been won, and not a situation where the hero retreats or fails, and lives to fight again another day? If you already knew that this character "should" win, why were you rolling dice? That's truly a rhetorical question, because the ideal would be that you wouldn't have those preconceptions, and instead you'd keep an open mind about the events, and therefore you could roll the dice without fearing the results. It's not a game of neat Aristotelic drama with a 3-act structure where you simply color in the particular details as you play.<br/><br/>This is a general structural principle for narrativist adventure games such as TSoY and Apocalypse World and whatever: players, and the GM particularly, have great powers over who attacks whom, and how the events are paced, but they do not have control over the outcome of those conflicts, and they don't get to make a priori moral judgements. You choose which wicked witch your character will oppose, and the GM might choose to delay the confrontation until the next session for pacing reasons (perhaps because all our time this session was spent on the missing brother subplot), but neither of you gets to decide that you win, and neither of you gets to decide that you're the hero. (Who makes that moral judgement? The audience does, which of course includes both you and the GM, but it also includes other players - and all of you are acting under a different set of concerns when playing a character and when deciding what a story was "about" in hindsight.)<br/><br/>But anyway, the thread topic wasn't to sing defense for how TSoY is set up. Rather, I should say that it's relatively easy to make it resemble e.g. the newest Heroquest more in regards to how it deals with PC failure. For example, a simple hack would be to replace the BDtP procedure with a Sacrifice mechanism: whenever you lose a conflict and don't like the outcome, you may take Harm equal to the difference of the check results to win the conflict instead. Only PCs can do the Sacrifice. This obviously replaces the ordinary Harm assignment systems, and you might need to fiddle a bit with some Secrets and whatnot, but overall it's not problematic.<br/><br/>For an even more radical hack, consider making that Sacrifice cost a Story Guide prerogative instead of counting arbitrary dicing outcomes: the SG decides how much it'll cost you to reverse a given conflict outcome, based on whether the hero should be winning or losing at this part of the story. That way the SG can ensure that nobody gets away with anything too easily, and that PCs catch the breaks they need to fulfill their great destinies.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433979">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433979/#Comment_433979" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T16:03:59+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  4:03PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eh, I might have over- or mis-stated the problem there.

This is mostly the gripe of a mechanic who's polishing one of the few remaining rough edges out of a beautiful machine, admittedly, and not so much a serious practical issue for playing the game. (Although I would also fix the thing where I always forget to assign as much Harm as I should when I SG the game, while I'm messing with this aspect.)<br/><br/><b>*</b> The extended conflict / BDtP system is heavy machinery in a dainty cultural context, one that seems to be growing daintier by the day. One of the most common complaints about TSoY is that the extended conflict can get boring because it's so long, and the answer to that basically is "be a better Story Guide", which is not very useful. Ultimately the problem is a cultural one in that the specific procedures the extended conflict uses are intended to make trad gamers at ease, but by doing that it encourages rutted, inflexible narration and fictional maneuvering. It does not strictly speaking prevent excellence, but too many groups have to play around it instead of with its aid.<br/><br/>(The extended conflict is an extremely modular component of the game, incidentally. You could just throw in the <i>Sorcerer</i> combat system in its stead, for example, and it'd do the job.)<br/><br/><b>*</b> XP work could use a little bit of zing, again to encourage less trad thought-patterns. Specifically, the notion of Keys could maybe be expressed in some more gamified and fun way, and expending XP could also maybe be more "fun". As it stands, the system just does book-keeping in this regard. The concept of Advance Debt in SS is a step in the right direction, I think, but more could be done. I could see some sort of "Advancement check" made against your session-specific xp total once per session to see if you gain an Advance, or something like that, just to make the xp-gathering feel less like counting bread-crumbs.<br/><br/><b>*</b> The game should have either a more active publishing schedule, or more in-built support tools for the Story Guide in developing campaigns and in general being an independent creative master of their domain. Specifically, tools for developing campaign-specific crunch, more concrete tools for prepping scenarios, and more solid NPC tools. Also, a clearer presentation of the minimal system core, and the creative reasons why one might opt to add crunch on top. I don't really need any of this myself (surprise, surprise), but I think that the game is a bit opaque to the more lightweight half of the hobbyist audience (very much like <i>Burning Wheel</i>, another game that is not that complex, but rather wide). Considering how the most popular TSoY products are apparently the <i>Solar System</i> and <i>Lady Blackbird</i>, it seems that people want clear, straightforward and ready-made rather than obscure DIY philosophy mixed in with extremely traditional attitudes about campaign development.<br/><br/>I'm also considering whether the game might benefit from having some GM-side procedural rules, but I think that might ultimately be some different game altogether. TSoY is a traditional roleplaying game at heart in this one way above all: there is a GM, and they're responsible for scenario content, pacing and dramatic coordination. Putting huge constraints on that instead of mere technical advice to improve the GM's work doesn't feel like the Solar System to me anymore.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433981">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433981/#Comment_433981" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T16:32:21+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  4:32PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Eh, I might have over- or mis-stated the problem there.

This is admittedly a pretty subtle (and perhaps vapid) difference when PCs are almost always protagonists and NPCs almost never are. Still, the reason for why the advantages you list are not overwhelming and ensure consistent PC victory is in that observation: it's not a "PCs triumph at the end" theme, it's just an artifact of being the protagonist.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433982/#Comment_433982" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-17T16:49:08+00:00" title="June 17, 2014  4:49PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2014 4:49PM by Nathan_H.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bringing Down the Pain is a whole nother can a worms.  <br/>I like that TSoY tries to keep one foot in traditional territory, and for that I appreciate it.  <br/>It's weird to be talking about a child that even it's father abandoned.<br/><br/>About the whole Key thing as heroic arc, and why do I need to have things spelled out for me.

Anyway, as many of you have said, it's not a huge departure from regular TSoY.  Keys would maybe just have branches.

But, I have had problems both as a GM and as a player in framing Refresh scenes and making them more interesting than "Sleeping for 8 hours" scenes.<br/>2) The XP thing feels like a throwback to trad gaming, but at the same time, I wonder if keys would work as well without them. Maybe if we added a Goal tracker similar to the Harm Tracker and have Keys move the Goal Tracker, that might work as well.<br/>3) I think that Keys, XPs and Transcendence have no practical value for a character/player that does not have a goal. That is not obvious, but it is evident in players that have utilized all three of these features together. If you have a goal for this character, Transcendence is a bulletproof way to affect that Goal. The GM and other players have no way to stop you except to try and prevent Transcendence. I don't know if this sort of protection is needed with today's gamers. But it is undeniable that it works to give the players a tool to change the game setting,<br/><br/>  I have had issues with BDtP as well. There have been some conflicts where it was very fun. But for others, we have hit a road block. This has a lot to do with the following: Players are engaged in an argument/debate/rhetoric and they use their best arguments to try and get bonus dice/assistance rolls from their fellow players. The contested roll goes poorly and for whatever reason the player decides to BDtP. Then they need to narrate their on-going attempts to win the argument/etc., but they have already used their best stuff. I have seen this issue with DITV too, where the players have blown their load before the dice are rolled.<br/><br/>  All-in-all, I love the system. I am planning on writing a sci-fi Solar System game this year. It will be inspired by TSOY, Solar System, Star Trek and StarGate SG-1. I am hoping to playtest a version with my Face-to-face group within a month.<br/>Dave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_434081">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H" title="Nathan_H"><img alt="Nathan_H" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/239/n4VY6CGK3720T.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nathan_H">Nathan_H</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/434081/#Comment_434081" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-19T11:46:53+00:00" title="June 19, 2014 11:46AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe player characters have Key slots, like you have 6 slots, then bingo - you're dead!
