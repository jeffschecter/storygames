If it's not RPGs/Story Games, then it's video games, both educational and recreational. I've been working in Unity3d a lot lately, but frequenting this website a lot in my off-time, and I've been trying to come up with a way to marry the two together. In other words, I was considering creating some kind of game that was an RPG, but delivered in a software format.<br/><br/>What do you guys think about this concept?<br/>Would you be interested in a Story Game or RPG that was delivered as an Android or iPhone app, complete with chargen and dice roller?<br/>Do you have any cool ideas for this but need someone with some programming and video game design knowledge to help see it through?<br/>How viable of a business model do you think this could be?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347640">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347640/#Comment_347640" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T10:10:16+00:00" title="November  2, 2011 10:10AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we'll get a better sense of this once Apple approves the pending Dungeon World app for iOS.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347645/#Comment_347645" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T10:51:18+00:00" title="November  2, 2011 10:51AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2011 10:51AM by sage.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's completely possible!<br/><br/>The first two games I know of in this format, Dungeon World Basic and Powers for Good: Issue 0 are both on the way to the app store right now. Dungeon World Basic was actually approved yesterday but when I downloaded it I noticed a bug I just couldn't let slide, I'm resubmitting now (as in: this very moment).<br/><br/>For this first iteration I'm only aiming for the text plus some media features: nice navigation, sound, commentary, that kind of stuff. I'd love to add chargen, even a dice roller, but I'm trying to stick with good software design here and put out a solid first version, then iterate.<br/><br/>From the feedback I've gotten there's rabid interest in this, just based on the concept. I'm guessing that our launch will be big. Granted, Dungeon World is already successful, so that helps, but people do seem to want this.<br/><br/>As a viable business model, I think without some other version available it won't see much play. Powers For Good is launching as an app first, so we'll see how that does. Maybe I'm wrong.<br/><br/>As far as the technical stuff, I've worked out a framework that uses HTML to do some of the heavy lifting, hopefully that will mean easier development for others and easier porting across platforms. I'd love to see what someone could do going the native code route, working within HTML does lock me out of some platform features (or require updating the native framework to do some javascript interop).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347650/#Comment_347650" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T11:51:24+00:00" title="November  2, 2011 11:51AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 2, 2011 11:52AM by Zachary_Wolf.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the insight Sage. I didn't realize you guys had plans for an iPhone version of DW. How was you experience with iPhone Development? I dabbled in it a few months back but never actually submitted anything to Apple. Plus, I had difficulties programming in the native apple language coming from a c# background. Did you just use the standard tools for development?<br/><br/>Unity3d is primarily a 3d application (obviously) but they have a pretty easy to use GUI system that I've been tooling around with. I was thinking one could couple a GUI-based product with some actual 3d features. I was thinking along the lines of a multi-media RPG package, with some interactive fiction or a themed graphic novel to help convey the setting of whatever game it was, some music that the group can listen to in the background as they play, maybe a chargen system that could export to pdf, an interactive "gm screen", quick access to web content for the game and things like that. Bottom line is it can be a multiplatform release, covering Windows, Mac, iPhone, Android, even Xbox 360.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347694/#Comment_347694" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-02T20:27:02+00:00" title="November  2, 2011  8:27PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A role-playing game "delivered" in a software format (instead of the more common book format or pseudo-boardgame format): yes, interested.<br/>Software <i>for a smartphone</i>: no, not for me.<br/><br/>What I'm interested in seeing, though, is role-playing games which use different tools, like software, to push the boundary of what a role-playing is \u2014 rather than just providing "more of the same" in a shiny new package.

A few months back I interviewed a number of textbook publishers about their ebook efforts and they all more or less told me the same thing: It's important to innovate in the space, but the current technology is really conducive to novels and not at all conducive to reference texts. Graphics, charts and the like just don't play that well with the format. And moving about inside the text can be tedious. While they're all putting their toes in the water, actual sales are pretty dismal.<br/><br/>iPad and other devices with more processing power and display capabilities could be an entirely different story, but there's been less experimentation on that front, at least in the textbook field.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347742/#Comment_347742" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T08:03:05+00:00" title="November  3, 2011  8:03AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Rafu">@Rafu</a><br/>I'm a big advocate of free stuff, so unless I had to sink an awful lot of time or money into the project, it would most likely be free, or at least have a free version available.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Ivan">@Ivan</a><br/>That's one of the ideas that was floating around in my head.

Apple has pretty strict rules on any content that can be unlocked via purchase being available through their store as well, which means they get a cut. There's no simple way to just give away an otherwise pay app to those that have the PDF, instead you have to have an in-app purchase that's automatically unlocked for PDF purchasers, which means a lot more infrastructure for a developer to manage. It's certainly possible (it's basically what Comixology does) it's just an annoying hurdle.<br/><br/>Piracy isn't something that indie developers really need to care about, which is good, since mobile apps are just as susceptible to piracy. There are stories from iOS devs of seeing significant parts of their leaderboards filled with non-purchasers. Distribution as software is not a magic anti-piracy bullet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_347753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347753/#Comment_347753" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T11:08:31+00:00" title="November  3, 2011 11:08AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            @ ivan &amp; Sentient: when I say Free, I'm not talking "gratis" at all. <i>That's</i> a very different concern, and one which has to do with marketing strategies and revenue plans, which I'm not an expert on except inasmuch as I can say: that what you do is Free affects your marketing and revenue strategies a little, but is no big deal.

You could certainly play 4E without their online tools, their character and monster builder and their Compendum encyclopedia, but I would never want to. <br/><br/>DDI is a monthly subscription to an hosted service, so it has that nice steady piracy-resistant revenue stream that the accountants like.  It also locks in players to some degree: once your character is built in the character builder, you're not going to be able to export them without hand-copying them onto paper.  If you unsubscribe, you lose access to your character.  Hope you printed them out!<br/><br/>I don't think anything of the scale of DDI could ever be contemplated by an indie developer.  Wizards has built a tremendous amount of software for DDI and has rolled a lot of content live with it.

There's not much you couldn't do in principle in a PDF, but the UI is tailored to it. Take the table of contents, for example: a PDF could have a link back to the ToC on every page so you can jump from chapter to chapter easily. In DW:Basic and PfG:Issue 0 you can double tap to bring up a ToC overlay which lets you scroll between chapters.<br/><br/>There's also developer commentary at some points. In a PDF these could be margin notes, some overlay layer, or just a link to an end note and a link back. In the app you can tap on a section with commentary and the text rotates around, revealing commentary "hidden" behind it. Tap again and the text rotates back.<br/><br/>The one thing that is different from a PDF is that the text can be re-flowed. Viewing a PDF on a device that you can hold in different orientations often means holding the device in the orientation the PDF was designed for, or having the text scaled dramatically. With re-flowing text the "book" adapts to each orientation as well as smaller screens. With some smart design, there's still layout touches as well. It's really kinda cool.<br/><br/>Like I said, this is the first generation. It's on par with Wired's app, if you're familiar with that, but with an open development model. In fact, once you get started with the framework, it's amazingly simple. Once I finish dealing with actually getting DW and PfG out I'll be putting together a how-to for everyone else wanting to try it, it really is quite simple.<br/><br/>I think the next generation will feature two things: advanced interactivity, like a character manager built into your book; and games designed for this format, taking full advantage of the tools available. For all their shortcomings books are actually one of the best ways to convey written text, apps can only do so much to challenge that. The inflection point comes when the games start being designed for the format.<br/><br/>Of course there's some lockout issues with requiring devices. The DW/PfG path should mesh well with other formats, even desktop, but I haven't proven that yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347780/#Comment_347780" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T14:38:31+00:00" title="November  3, 2011  2:38PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2011 2:41PM by johnzo.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>I think the next generation will feature two things: advanced interactivity, like a character manager built into your book; and games designed for this format, taking full advantage of the tools available.</blockquote>\nHow is your app's searchability?  <br/><br/>To me, a smooth search -- with fast performance, keyword highlighting, contextualized hit-lists, etc -- is the key feature of an electronic reference text.<br/><br/>Re-flowing: yeah.

It might not be important to most of your users.<br/><br/>All I can say is that given the choice between the app you've described and a plain old searchable PDF, I think I'd use the PDF every time.  I don't need flashy developer commentary while I'm playing a game; what I need is to be able to quickly find out whether my maximum encumbrance is based on my strength score or my strength modifier.<br/><br/>Also, every PDF viewer I know of has one-click access to a ToC, so that's not something new.<br/><br/>Lest I sound like a negatron, I am still jazzed to see game designers exploring this new media.  And I bet that your HTML-centric approach will have a big advantage in display performance over a PDF.  My experience with heavy PDFs on a tablet isn't great, with lots of laggy behavior as the little tablet CPU struggles to distill the right pixels out of all those megabytes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347792/#Comment_347792" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T16:11:41+00:00" title="November  3, 2011  4:11PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 3, 2011 4:11PM by NomdePlume.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: sage</cite>Search isn't implemented.

Search is a workaround for content that wouldn't otherwise be easy to reference, which isn't the case here.<br/><br/>I wanted to test this a little, so I came up with this fairly reasonable case: I need to see some details on the Fighter's Signature Weapon. I know it's a Fighter starting move, that's it.<br/><br/>Starting from the first page of the PDF and the first chapter of the app:<br/>Goodreader: took four taps and about a second of search<br/>App: three taps with no load time<br/><br/>This is a little skewed as the state of the app's cache affects load time, but I'm sure there's similar performance characteristics in Goodreader. I also ignored the 16+ taps and couple of seconds to enter the search query. Additionally Goodreader's search is linear and the move is near the start of the book, if I had started from the page after it the search time would be longer.<br/><br/>For reference, in Goodreader:<br/>Tap to bring up controls<br/>Tap on search<br/>Type in query<br/>Tap Search<br/>Wait for linear search<br/>If the search goes past the end of the book, tap "Yes, begin at beginning"<br/><br/>In the app:<br/>Double tap to bring up ToC<br/>Scroll to Fighter chapter<br/>Tap fighter chapter<br/>Tap Starting Moves<br/><br/><br/><br/>For me, personally, this app serves my reference needs better.

And a good TOC and alphabetical index can definitely mitigate the need for search.  <br/><br/>The Ruby Pickaxe PDF is outstanding in this regard, I only rarely resort to keyword searches on that book because its indexing and organization are so good.  The D&amp;D 4E Rules Compendium (sadly, not available as a PDF) is another terrific example; it's a big thick book but the organization and indexing are good enough to make it very functional as a reference.<br/><br/>That said, I still appreciate being able to fall back on a keyword search so I can search in a way that the author and indexer don't anticipate.  <br/><br/>For instance, look at hard moves in DW.  They're a core concept, but because they don't appear as a heading  (at least they don't in the Red Book) they're probably not going to show up in a TOC.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_347800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/347800/#Comment_347800" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-03T17:31:39+00:00" title="November  3, 2011  5:31PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would think that the ability to toggle optional rules and fan created hacks/hombrewed rules/playbooks and have them seamlessly integrated into the rules text would be the key feature.

Also, I'm not saying everything should be a $0.99 download.  You could make a lot of things available for free through updates (for example, guest commentary by other designers/notables/podcasters).  You could also implement things like a designer blog into regularly scheduled updates (or even, gasp, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">ads</span>notifications for other designers' games that you support).  Alternately, it would be easy to do something like a $200 ransom to put out an update with new material.  When it comes to people mainlining their own code into the app to hack the rules, you run into the problem of GM's not being able to implement it on their player's versions of the app (which is what would be really cool) without being more trouble than its worth.

I'm not sure why, and I am just one data point - hell, maybe I'm just having a bad brain day.<br/><br/>I want to say I'd be finding it easier if there were a lot fewer words - like, if the default text mode were a lot closer to straight procedures-of-play. <br/><br/>Also, everything I'm looking at is gray. Would color make this easier to pick out concepts, or would it just add noise? I dunno, I just feel like the gray is putting me to sleep.<br/><br/>I've been flirting with iBooks lately and finding that the page-turning actually really works - the short-chapter structure of PfG is really appealing to present in this array of side-by-side scrolls, but it contributes to a feeling that I don't know where I am.<br/><br/>And just to take it to crazy-town: what if there were a <i>zooming</i> structure? If at the default level of viewing, there was a very sparse PoP document, and as you clicked on points they got expanded upon? That would probably really irritate a lot of readers and delight a few of us.<br/><br/>Maybe the takeaway here is that a procedural text like a game book needs to have <i>multiple</i> ways of viewing it when it goes truly electronic. <br/><br/>There's my big splatter of brain-dump.

Could a more colorful option exist? Totally. Just not with the resources I currently have.<br/><br/>The structure honestly comes slightly from ease of development. Zooming sounds really interesting, but it's also not as easy to do on my side. Something to look into, certainly. The side-by-side scrolls are somewhat standard (see: Wired, New York Times, etc.). I had thought they'd feel more comfortable than something crazy, but I could be wrong.<br/><br/>The tone of the text was a choice.

I like the page-turny interface of iBooks for reading PDFs, but for something like this that is built from the ground-up as an app, the scrolly interface is way better. (Can you imagine how awesome it would be to have an app like this for each Fiasco playset?) <br/><br/>Quite apart from the format, the game looks like a lot of fun, and I can't wait to try it. I really like the GM's power economy and how it relates directly to difficulty numbers and the length of scenes. Good work!<br/><br/>Also, not to thread hijack, but are the PfG character sheets available yet?

Right now, we've got the clips from the Walking Eye but in the Full Version I can completely see us doing video clips, more sound clips and images to help explain things.  As well, we're experimenting with a kind of context-related reference where you can flip the interface if we have design notes for areas of the "book".  Kind of like a developer's commentary - we'll have little sound bytes or text bits to discuss why we did something a certain way or add in little anecdotes about our process for the game.<br/><br/>I think it'd be a really fun, interactive look at the guts of the game and tie in well with our attempt at designing publicly and being transparent about the process as well as add some value to the end product.<br/><br/>I also tend to assume people like listening to me make fun of Sage and joke around about how much fun it is to design an RPG so I may have a bias...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_349213">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen" title="Neko_Ewen"><img alt="Neko_Ewen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://neko-machi.com/extra/miku_avi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neko_Ewen">Neko_Ewen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349213/#Comment_349213" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-19T07:58:15+00:00" title="November 19, 2011  7:58AM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So there's a Wario Ware game for GameCube that has this one mode that's really fascinating. Basically a doctor on screen tells you to do something (touch your nose, sing a song, etc.) while playing one of the micro-games, and then the other players tap the A button to applaud according to how well they think you did. So even something that is on the surface a pure video game can use human interaction to its benefit.<br/><br/>There's also Pac-Man Vs. on GameCube, one of the few games to use the Game Boy Advance link cable really effectively. One player is Pac-Man and the other three are ghosts. The ghosts share the TV, but can only see parts of the maze. The Pac-Man player uses the GBA and can see the whole maze, and when a ghost catches Pac-Man, you pass the GBA to that player and he or she gets to be Pac-Man until caught.<br/><br/>So the enhanced e-book tack of Dungeon World is really neat, but I'd love to see an app that basically walks you through playing a story game, and maybe makes passing around your smartphone a part of how you play it. It could do randomization behind the scenes, play sounds, show pictures, do stuff based on concealing or revealing information to/from different players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_349285">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/349285/#Comment_349285" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-11-20T13:18:28+00:00" title="November 20, 2011  1:18PM">November 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 20, 2011 1:18PM by Matthijs.">edited November 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If there's one thing we need to remember with the RPG market AND the gadget (smartphone etc) market, it's: What people say they want, and what they actually pay money for, are two very different things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15303/taking-rpgs-and-story-games-to-a-digital-format" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15303/taking-rpgs-and-story-games-to-a-digital-format" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/15303/taking-rpgs-and-story-games-to-a-digital-format/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F15303%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F15303%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
