                    OK, so ENworld.  Denise is <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=21037" rel="nofollow">over at the Forge</a> trying (again, God bless her) to whip up some support for more cross-pollination between the two communities, particularly regarding the Ennie awards.  I'm all about that, but every time I go and poke around ENworld, I leave thinking I have nothing in common with them, and that were I to talk about my game there I'd get laughed at and/or kicked in the throat.  Conversely, I see a lot of cool people I respect saying it's great, so spill it - what's the deal with ENworld, and why should I pay more attention to what they are doing?                </div>

<p>Okay, the down-side:  They simply don't buy the mantra of "System Matters."  They are, <em>by conscious focus of the site</em> not talking about any system other than d20.  It's just never going to happen.  And d20 is the cause of many of their problems.  It just is.  And they don't want to hear it, because ... well, basically "Hear, o Roleplayers, d20 is thy system, and there is no system but d20!"</p>
<p>So, I've waded in there before.  It feels like wearing a very constrictive set of badly tailored clothes.  I can still walk around and talk and stuff, but I can't move freely.  There are things, many things, that I cannot do without ripping the clothes.</p>
<p>So what's the up-side?  Huge, vast numbers of people who have (among their other interests) a keen interest in the craft of running and playing games well.  If you have things to say about that craft (perhaps derived from your theory, but not actually talking about theory) and you can fit it in the tight clothes, you can have really good discussions.</p>

                            Heya,<br/>
<br/>
Tony's analogy is really good.  I felt the same way every time I've lurked there.  I like d20.  I do, but there's so much more out there than just that.  Heck, I'd be happy if they even wanted to discuss and compare systems like True 20, Perfect 20 and the RuneQuest OGL.  But their topics seem very narrowly focussed on playing d20 and playing it well.  Which is great! I hope it leads to improved enjoyment for them. But... it's not my thing.<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            If you have any game running anything remotely d20 ("OGL" etc), then it is THE place to go for wicked tricked-out characters, setting help, and cool ideas for traditional play.  I'm not sure they are totally "unbought" on System Matters, and I've never found them all aggro about d20's righteousness, but ENWorld is definitely not the place for that sort of discussion. It would be like talking about fishing on a NASCAR forum or something. It just doesn't need to be there- There's no audience for it and it would come off as prosthetltizing (sp?). Arguing against d20 on ENWorld is like arguing for Catholicism in a Southern Baptist church; uncomfortable and agitating.<br/><br/>Everyone there seems to be having a good time. Those that are aware of RPGNet come over there for the Other Games. <br/><br/>The Roach has no outlet in ENWorld.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, for the fact that:<br/><br/>1) Many of the ENWorld people have written and published d20 system info and supplements (or want to).<br/>2) The ENNIE Awards look at ALL of RPGs, not just d20 stuff (like a few years back).<br/><br/>There is a lot of overlap in this area alone. d20 dudes and Forge or other Self Publishing dudes should be able to run illustration, pricing info, distro and publiching info and the like past each other in a peer environment. And plus, the awards, which bring awareness to everyone of what's going on on the other side of the fence (for both camps) That's about all there is.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            Hey gang.  I've been a member here for several months but I've had about zero time to peruse the site and post thanks to life being busy.  I was pointed to this discussion by my pal Mark Causey who I know is very active here.  Since I'm a Mod at ENWorld I have a perspective on the place to offer.<br/>
<br/>
First up, ENWorld is just NOT for everybody and that's a plain and simple truth.  Some people don't like that it's d20 focused.  Some people don't like the rules there (particularly they don't like that they can't flame somebody they think needs flaming or they can't use the colorful language that would violate the "Grandma Rule").  Some people don't like the culture there.<br/>
<br/>
But I think it is in error to believe that non-d20 talk isn't welcome.  I'm not even playing much d20 these days and was just today posting in a thread about the Warhammer FRP system.  Nobody should be getting on your case about posting a thread that doesn't involve D&amp;D or d20.  And if they do, report their post and myself or one of the other mods will correct that because ENWorld is not about shouting down anybody who doesn't play your favorite system, whatever it happens to be.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, a lot of what gaming is about doesn't really have all that much to do with the system.  I see threads all the time that discuss campaign, adventure and story ideas that don't use any technical terms at all.  That is a huge resource for anybody that wants to bounce ideas off a large community.  There are almost always over 1,000 people logged on there at any given moment and the quality of discourse on most topics is fairly good I think.  So if you're having difficulty working out a plotline or are just hunting for ideas that involve zombie werewolves then you can post a thread on it and get tons of feedback without even discussing system.<br/>
<br/>
As to the ENnies, I'm not involved with them at all.  Denise is a great lady, strong and organized and I applaud what she's done with the awards.  I also personally know most of the judges and just got finished hanging out with them at GenCon and they are all great people (and you have not LIVED until you sit up until 4:00 AM listening to Teflon Billy's story about how he, back in the day, told Peter Adkinson, "This whole Magic: The Gathering thing?  Yeah, that's never going to take off.").  I am very pleased that the awards are not d20 only.  In fact, for the last couple of years, some of the big winners have not been d20.  Warhammer FRP won Game of the Year last year and there were lots of awards given out to other non d20 games this year including the new Shadowrun.<br/>
<br/>
As a final note, a new website has been set up by Morrus (who runs ENWorld) that is virtually unmoderated and largely off topic but is almost wholly populated by gamers.  It's called Circvs Maximvs and can be found here:  http://www.enworld.org/circvs/<br/>
If you want to hang with gamers but not be bound by the same rules as at ENWorld then it's a great place.<br/>
<br/>
If anybody has any further questions they'd like to address directly to me as an ENWorld Mod or long time poster there, feel free.  And I hope to see some of you at the September NC Game Day.  I saw that Mark had posted about it here and you guys are always welcome.                        </div>

                            Man, it's cool to see Rel post here. SG is the new, hip place to be!<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm a long-time denizen of ENWorld; my post count is up around 3200 or something. I also organize the ENWorld Chicago Gameday.<br/><br/>In general, I think it's a great place to hang out, and I've met tons of great people via the site. I really started posting there when I was getting tired of the volatile nature of the RPG.net forums. ENWorld is well-moderated and not as prone to the flaming arguments you see on RPG.net and other boards. Some people think this makes ENWorld a little mild, but I generally like it.<br/><br/>As for the d20 focus, well, the site was born out of Eric Noah's 3e rumors site; D&amp;D/d20 is its main reason for being. That said, there's a lot of love for <em>Castles &amp; Crusades</em>, True20, WFRP, HERO, and older editions of D&amp;D, too.<br/><br/>However, TonyLB has it right. The big impediment with ENWorld is that most people there will argue 'till they're blue in the face that pretty much everything in Forge (and related) theory is totally, utterly wrong. "Does 3.5 take away too much power from the DM?" is a frighteningly common thread topic. "Famous" ENWorlders like Teflon Billy, e.g., has a .sig quote that basically says, "Show me a Forge game and I'll show you me walking away from the table." He's a great guy, but it saddens me. At ENWorld, System Doesn't Matter, the DM is God, Immersion is King, and "role-play, not roll-play" can be said with a straight face.<br/><br/>Consequently, I've found it harder and harder to participate there the more I learn about Forge theory and indie RPGs. More and more of the play I see described there turns me off. And when I try to talk about it, people respond like I'm from Mars.<br/><br/>Granted, 100% of the community isn't like this, but enough are that I notice it.                        </div>

I don't mean to paint too grim a picture. There are a lot of great people there, and there is no better site for D&amp;D/d20 discussion. And jonrog1's <a href="http://www.enworld.org/showthread.php?t=4912" rel="nofollow">Drunk Southern Girls</a> d20M/Dark*Matter story hour alone is reason to spend some time on the boards.                        </div>

                            I used to be on ENWorld a lot, but since I got into more indie games, the discussion is more difficult there.  Buzz is pretty much on the money.  Narrativism isn't very welcome there, with the exception of a cute little mechanic or two (if that even qualifies).  Sim and Gamist stuff fly though.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, the whole "GM needs more power than 3.5 gives" and the "Golden Rule" thing is still held up as pretty much a sacred cow.  There can be some great setting discussion, though.  So, check it out for your deep, immersive color needs, but go somewhere else for any System Matters.                        </div>

Yeah, I noticed that too, hardcore (though it might be changing a little as Rel states, at least about what games to play. I'd kinda hate to see "Theory" threads, though. I figure if they want that they'll come to RPGNet or whatever).  However, I don't blame them. Most threads I saw on the topic of "narrativism=good" or whatever were usually instigated by folks who had a half-grasp on the idea, and were so excited by it that they basically just generated too much wake in talking about "the awesome other way to play" and all that. It just didn't feel <i>proper</i>. So I totally understand the backlash.<br/><br/>And hey, Teflon Billy's reaction is totally OK by me: He'd walk away from a Forge game. I'd walk away from most RPGA events (and be reaaaaaally wary about d20-based stuff unless I knew the players), and I don't like miniature or card games at all. So basically, while I don't begrudge people their fun, or classify it as lesser or greater than mine (card games for example: I tried my damnedest to get into them but failed), I know what I like and don't like.<br/><br/>Saying that there's a chance to educate or expose ENWorld to other styles of play, other modes of thought, in a community where they know what they like, and love doing it, is a little invasive and disrespectful IMO.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I don't really count "Memoir 44" as miniatures. I think of miniatures as "foam scenery, inch measuring sticks", etc. I tried it but couldn't get into it. And CCGs I just can't get into. We tried with DUNE and even POKEMON, but the closest I ever got was when a friend and I got one of those "These are the two magic decks that world champions went head to head with, recreated in this set; just shuffle and play!" MtG sets. But I wasn't comfortable at all with adding or removing cards from the set.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            I'll agree that any kind of "board invasion" where a bunch of folks came in and said, "You folks really need to get a better grasp on Narativism as a concept and learn how it can make your games better." would be met with suspicion if not outright hostility.  But there is clearly an element of ENWorlders who already hold that opinion anyway.  But recently a poster there (I think it was Buttercup) said something to the effect that, "We gamers should really try to start any discussion or argument with the notion in our mind that, as gamers, we already have a lot more in common than we think.  Differences in playstyle are really just nuances to a hobby that is fairly rare in most communities."<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't suggest that anybody play with or hang out with (online or otherwise) people who you can't get along with due to playstyle.  But it has always seemed to me that there is a vast amount of area open for discussion before you ever even get to the point of talking about whether you have compatible playstyles.<br/>
<br/>
As for the Teflon Billy comment, I've been lucky enough to get to know Jeff pretty well over the last couple of years, at GenCon and on the boards.  My interpretation is that some of the "deep immersion roleplaying" folks I've been around can tend toward being "spotlight hogs" or "drama queens" and he just has not tolerance for that at all.  That said, I'm not his spokesperson or anything and if you are ever over at Circvs Maximvs, I'll bet that he'd happily discuss the matter (he's one of the Mods there under the name Diehard Murphy.).                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite><br/>As for the RPG.net mod comment - I'll just let that slide.</blockquote>
No offense, Kuma, but I have on more than one occasion seen an RPG.net mod fan flames rather than douse them. In one heated GNS debate, I didn't even realize that a user who was posting very inflammatory stuff was a mod until I tried to add them to my Ignore List.<br/><br/>Still, it's not appropriate for me to make a blanket statement about all the mods, including you, so please accept my apology.<br/><br/>I may simply be too used to how things work at ENWorld. The mods there are very diplomatic and keep the boards pretty PG-13. Of course, the flip side of this is that I've seen their mods shut down threads for some pretty (IMO) inoffensive reasons. You have a lot more free reign at RPG.net. I guess that the RPG.net mods should be able to enjoy that freedom, too.<br/><br/>It still puts me off sometimes, though.                        </div>

                            EN World is a pretty cool place.  I've been there for a while (as LostSoul).<br/>
<br/>
I think that if you started a thread about the Roach, or whatever, people would ask what it's like; if they don't dig that sort of thing, they'd bow out of the thread.  If they do dig that sort of thing, you could get a good response.<br/>
<br/>
It's also a great place to talk about D&amp;D.  I find it really helpful when I need to clarify a rule, or figure out how to optimize a character of mine.                        </div>
