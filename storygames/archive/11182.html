I've long since lost the game in a hard-drive crash, but I still remember really wanting to run this for a group as a seasonal thing.  Just something Christmas-y, silly and fun.  I'd be curious to know if anyone else ever did and how it went over.<br/><br/>It occurs to me, though, that holiday-themed games needn't be brightly colored affairs full of candy canes and Santa Claus and islands of misfit toys.  As in the film <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyeux_No\xebl" rel="nofollow">Joyuex No\xebl</a>, Christmas stories can be told against a variety of backdrops, including war.<br/><br/>I haven't ever done <i>any</i> gaming that evoked, deliberately or otherwise, holiday feeling.  I'm not sure I've even set a game at Christmas<i>time</i>.  I guess after <i>Die Hard</i> it seemed best to give the day a wide berth.  Or something.<br/><br/>What have you done in terms of holiday-themed gaming?  If you haven't done any, then why not?  Would you if the opportunity arose?<br/><br/>And remember: Santa is watching you.  Right now.  And in the bathroom.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jchokey" title="jchokey"><img alt="jchokey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jchokey">jchokey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248549/#Comment_248549" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-25T14:04:17+00:00" title="December 25, 2009  2:04PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 25, 2009 2:04PM by jchokey.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't actually played it, but I'd kind of like to try "The Secret Lives of Gingerbread Men".<br/>\n<br/>\nI think a neat twist on "Christmas-themed" gaming might be to base it on the "Home for the holidays-- with a dysfunctional family" genre of story.  There are lots of modern examples of this, but the best (IMHO) is the historical flick "The Lion  In Winter".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249003/#Comment_249003" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T12:02:36+00:00" title="December 29, 2009 12:02PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I tend to like tongue-in-cheek holiday games, like The Christmas Wars skirmish wargame. Shootin' Ladders Frag Fest is also a good one and easily could fit with the Christmas theme.<br/><br/>There also was a supplement for Spirit of the Century called "Spirit of the Season" which was fun.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
