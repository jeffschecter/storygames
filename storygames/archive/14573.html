It doesn't assume conflict resolution will involve violence, though it does hint that violence might come up; i.e. the tough boy suitor might get in a fight. The basic resolution of G x B is, you roleplay a series of dates, and the Momoko gives each Suitor a card each time he does something she likes. So if getting into a fight for her honor will please Momoko, then it could conceivably help resolve the conflict. Speaking of which, G x B does have conflict--specifically THE conflict, which suitor will win Momoko's heart? But it isn't about conflict in a way that most conflict-y  games are...in practice the game ends up being mostly about enjoying the hijinks and awkward sweetness of teenage dating.<br/><br/><b>Shock: Social Science Fiction</b> is an interesting case because while there's usually violence at the core of a Shock: game, it certainly doesn't have to be. You could define Praxis so they mostly rule out violence, or at least steer away from it. It is about conflict, front and center, though, and that plus the focus on ripped-from-the-headlines thorny issues probably means a Shock: game without physical violence is rare.<br/><br/><b>Microscope</b> is pretty violence-agnostic, and certainly doesn't have combat mechanics. You craft the timeline of an epic, sweeping history, and play out scenes not to resolve conflicts, but to answer Questions: How did Marcus Antonius' illicit affair spell doom for the Republic? Who truly caused war to erupt in the Outer Galactic Reaches? Did the aging Tyrant of the Middlemarch Kingdoms truly love his only daughter? Again, I think Microscope skews toward violence because of the thematic material: is there a national, global or galactic history that DOESN'T involve horrible violence and brutal war? But Microscope doesn't require that you ever roleplay a scene of violence; you can easily keep to exploring human scenes around the edges of the violence of history. <br/><br/><b>The Dreaming Crucible</b> doesn't have combat mechanics. It doesn't assume conflict resolution will have violence. it does skew toward its Heroines having trauma in their lives, which varies a lot in both severity and explicitness. So there can definitely be violence involved the Heroine's mortal life, and some of the threats of faerie can be physical, certainly. But the game doesn't push toward solving problems with vipolence, and it's fairly rare that a Heroine's response to an obstacle is "I beat it up" or "I kill it." Crucible's "conflicts" are called <i>Perils</i>, and they're deliberately sort of "soft conflicts," that is the Dark Faerie player declares something threatening, unpleasant or scary happening, then he and the Heroine player do a procedure to determine whether she passes through it pleasantly or unpleasantly. Not pass/fail, not win/lose, just "was the experience painful or not?" The focus is not on Conflict <i>per se</i>, but on being in the grip of an experience that changes you.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_332001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332001/#Comment_332001" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T21:34:04+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  9:34PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nicotine Girls is a good fit here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_332002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/332002/#Comment_332002" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T21:38:04+00:00" title="June 27, 2011  9:38PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now, "What is Violence?" is an interesting question!
