We've sold over 1000 copies and gotten aton of nice reviews. We're pretty happy. But...<br/>\n<br/>\nFor the first time we're thinking about doing a large print run. Before we do that there are some things we want to change about the book. We're looking at doing a makeover in the next 6 months. Here's my list of changes, but I'm hoping that I can get some feedback from those of you who are familiar with the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd no, we're not changing the title.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. The more I play the game the more I'm convinced that the role of the Superintendent is unnecessary. I want to rework the game text to reflect the way I currently enjoy playing the game. I still want to keep the Superintendent rules, but as a separate option.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I'm convinced the book can be more approachable. It can read easier and cleaner. Our target audience has always been anime and manga reader instead of gamers, and I want the game to be something that is easily playable. I think more play examples will go a long way toward making the game easier to understand.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. Matt  and I we're never happy with the books 9x6 size. We'll be switching to the standard manga size instead.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. Art. I've never been happy with the books art. I plan to re-illustrate the book in a different style.<br/>\n<br/>\n5. Editing. Panty Explosion will finally get a professional edit. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo these are the big things we plan to change, although I'll also be reviewing a years worth of feedback and advice from customers and fans. My hope is that, as outside observers, some of you might be able to point out some things that we're missing.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nJake                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89641">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thark" title="thark"><img alt="thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i99ronhe.island.liu.se/avatars/eyebrow32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thark">thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89641/#Comment_89641" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T02:13:23+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  2:13AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I've been playing in an ongoing (!!)

What I mean by that is that they could and should (and have!) work great as fodder for play, but a lot of the examples in the book are ... shall we say, not-so-dramatic stuff ("score well on the next English text" is not exciting to play out unless you really put some thought into how to present it). Now, in all fairness, when I just went back to look in the book, they weren't as bad as I remember it, but I still think some more explanation and suggestions on picking interesting agendas and their purpose would be a good thing (based on the initial choices of some of the people in our group).<br/><br/>I pointed the others to this thread, though I suspect they may be too lazy to sign up for the forum. :-)<br/><br/>--R                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89642/#Comment_89642" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T02:32:48+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  2:32AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            7 sessions?

I think we can remove the Superintendent rules to an "optional rules" section of the game and turn the game GMless pretty easily.<br/>\n<br/>\n"There's primarily one thing I've been personally dissatisfied with in terms of the book, and that is agendas, or rather the presentation thereof."<br/>\n<br/>\nY'know, when we wrote the Agendas list we were trying to stay away from anything that seemed too specific. But now, I think I'd go the other way. These are meant to be examples after all. Agendas in recent games I've played have been stuff like "Must kill my mom and the demon that has corrupted her", "must kill myself before the psychic can taint my thoughts and devour my soul", "must convince Kenji that it's me he truely loves", "must not explode anyones head" and "must become the most popular girl in my class". Stuff like that. Agendas are what the game is all about, and I agree that they need to be punchier then what's currently in the book. I have had some good games based around those Agendas, but it's always more interesting to choose Agendas that are... more interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thark" title="thark"><img alt="thark" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i99ronhe.island.liu.se/avatars/eyebrow32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thark">thark</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89645/#Comment_89645" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T02:54:13+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  2:54AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Can you tell me what you'd like to see?

I'll see what I can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n"Amusingly, I almost bought Panty Explosion recently, but as it was out of print ..."<br/>\n<br/>\nOut of print has been a problem. The book isn't really out of print, but we've had trouble getting it to IPR and some other outlets. It sells out too quick. Every time we print a run for IPR we end up selling them before we can put them in the mail. I don't think IPR has had any copies of the book since last December. This is pretty unfair to IPR, and Brennan and the guys have been pretty understanding. One of the reasons we want to do a larger print run is to make sure we can stock outlets like IPR and Key20. As it is we usually print 50-150 copies at a time, and those almost always go to fill orers from stores and customers through our own site, or get sold at conventions. Hell, more then one person has knocked on my door and asked to buy a copy.<br/>\n<br/>\nIPR went home from Gencon with about a dozen copies of the book, so even though the site currently says that it's sold out, they do have copies. I just recieved a small shippment of books as well, so I will happily fill orders through the Atarashi Games store. We'll likely be printing another 150 books early next month to get us through November.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Including a PDF of the game with every purchase would be better."<br/>\n<br/>\nThis month we're offering free worldwide shipping on all orders placed through our online store. NEXT month we're offering free PDFs with the purhase of a physical book.

Printing through Lulu almost triples the cost of our books, and that really eats into our profit. It's not so bad when we're just filling orders from our own store, but sending Lulu books to IPR or Key20 (who both take a fair cut) eats away at our profits even more. Of course, we've lately had some problems with our printer anyway.<br/>\n<br/>\n"An excellent reason to put off my purchase until after Dragon*Con.

Instead, because we'll be investing in a larger print run, we want to take the opportunity to make sure the game is as solid as possible.

I really like the more realistic art style in the book- it makes me think of Love and Pop, and Battle Royale, and Boogiepop Phantom, and all the manga that don't have the generic anime style and instead go for something a little less prettyshiny. That kind of art combined with the silly title really caught my eye and compelled me to pick the book up and read it, where a more shiny generic anime/Amerimanga style would have just gotten a quick glance at the back cover and a return to the shelf.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_89955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89955/#Comment_89955" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T19:46:23+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  7:46PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Is this going to be a more anime-esque style?

Really, it's not so much style that I'm concerned with, but content. I was recovering from an illness during the run up to printing the book, and didn't have time to do all the illustrations I wanted. We ended up using a bunch of illustration that I had done as kind of tests for that black and white style. I want to go back and do a lot more content focused art for the book, similar to Classroom Deathmatch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_89958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/89958/#Comment_89958" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-23T20:42:25+00:00" title="August 23, 2007  8:42PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having just bought the book, and starting to look through it, I love the stark black-and-white style.

While I know there are issues currently being discussed about the increased production values of indie games, if we are trying to click in with the manga and anime fans we do need to appeal to them.

I want to make sure character creation can be faster and more fluid, especially for the first time gamers that are a big part of our desired audience.I also want to include some pre-made characters (like we did in Classroom Deathmatch) for players who just want to jump in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90350/#Comment_90350" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T06:06:41+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  6:06AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope you don't change the look too much, that's what attracted me in the first place.

I know we'd have les people that would bring that up as a reason they didn't buy the game, but it seems to me that in most cases these people wouldn't have bought the game anyway.

Panchii I ran past a Japanese friend of mine before putting it on the cover and she thought it worked. As well the game has sold over in Japan as well as been shown to every other Japanese person I've had over at my place and none of them have pointed out the title as being incorrect. On the other hand the first draft of the CDM cover was openly laughed at and was changed after several of our PE Japanese fans debated how best to write the title.<br/><br/>I'll ask Keiji next time I see him (after I get back from vacation) about Panchii versus Pantsu.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: rafial</cite>Additional: regarding the early comment about "boring" ambitions (pass the english test).

With trying to gear the book towards the anime/manga crowd I can see a percieved need to change it to be more outlandish or adventurous.<br/><br/>On the other hand the last full PE game I played had the girl who's agenda was to dye her hair... often.
