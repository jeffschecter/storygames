                    Judson, Joshua &amp; I played New Edition, one of my 9 short games about tyrants. The dictator has died, and players are members of a committee of high-ranking regime officials and intellectuals charged with revising the leader's biography. <br/>
<br/>
For the first time in our series of Heads of State play-tests, we focused on a real dictator (N. Korea's Kim Jong il) rather than one that we invented. We picked six pages from the younger Kim's official bio, pdf downloadable at http://www.korea-dpr.com/pmenu.htm . I was particularly happy that we included a page on his career in cinema, though the official bio forgot to mention the time Kim had his security forces kidnap his favorite south korean director and hold him for eight years (http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,929182,00.html) <br/>
<br/>
The style of the bio was so distinct that it had an effect on play- it was difficult to transform its meaning since the entire book was an closely-knit edifice in ideologicial mythmaking and the text was already over the top and hard to beat for pomposity and hagiographic excess.<br/>
<br/>
We then created our characters and each picked a secret ideologically- tinged goal that the characters brought to the edit (for example, my general was trying to show that any abuses perpetrated by Kim were necessary evils, Judson's character was implicating surviving members of the regime). We also each had a hidden personal goal for the edit- Josh fixated on the need for industrial development that his character could profit from, I was puffing up the role of the army battalion I had commanded, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We each took 2 pages and spent points to make edits to the text, then passed around the pages until we had each had a chance to edit all pages. <br/>
<br/>
Juson kept laughing whenever he had to read that "from his early years Comrade Kim Jong Il possessed .... extraordinary perspicacity with regard to things and phenomena." (which incidentally sounds like one of the phrenological traits from my recent game chef entry)<br/>
<br/>
Josh and I traded edits as to whether the nation's mighty industrial productivity or stalwart fighting 75th battalian were more critical to the success of the revolution. <br/>
<br/>
Both Judson and Josh spent some points to edit away grammatical weirdness in the underlying bio, which never would have occured to me as a way to spend points.<br/>
<br/>
Once the editing we read the entire new version aloud and then revealed our motives. <br/>
<br/>
To end the game we each wrote a brief review of the new edition and suggested new titles.<br/>
<br/>
After playing, we thought that:<br/>
it would be better to start with a more neutral text like a wikipedia entry rather than with a section of a hagiography (this was already a variant rule)<br/>
distribute the editing ideologies randomly or otherwise enure that player had a range of goals.<br/>
2 pages each was too much- 1 page or less would be better<br/>
rather than giving player points to spend on different types of edits, give each player a set amount of different edits<br/>
less edits per round but more rounds of edits so players could better see how various players were changing the text<br/>

                            This was a quirky little game light on the roleplay and heavy on the fiddly bits of word choice and diction.  It was enjoyable, but it felt like only half of the whole game.  Notably, it has no reward system.  So I'd make edits that were in-line with my character, but the only thing that would happen were that the edits were made.  There was no reason not to use my points for anything else; my character had a goal, but I as a player did not.<br/>
<br/>
I think if all the agendas were used by somebody, the goal was to uncover different people's agendas, and there were shorter rounds and more of them, this could be an interesting game of baiting your fellow editors into showing their true colors or something similar, perhaps with an endgame where the remaining hidden agendas are rated for which got the forwarded the most, and then the players reveal what agenda they were forwarding.  Does that make any sense whatsoever?                        </div>

                            That makes sense. <br/>
<br/>
The draft as written has an option of players writing down in advance of each type of edit- and if these survive the editing process you get points for them. We didn't try it out. What you suggests sounds more flexible. Although I want players to be blatant and push the bio hard in their direction. I think that straight out contrast and conflict would be more interesting than subtle manipulation, especially for a short game. Perhaps there is a way to encourage both.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally while I get your point on the lack of a player end goal, that lack doesn't resonate with me in play. Partly through playtesting these dictator games I've realized (and we've experienced) that resource management &amp; abstract strategy are not where my interests lie. I think that in all games, whether I'm playing or designing, what I'm shooting for is a system/experience that encourages the production of interesting and eccentric information/ narrative.                        </div>

<em>I think that in all games, whether I'm playing or designing, what I'm shooting for is a system/experience that encourages the production of interesting and eccentric information/ narrative.</em><br/><br/>I can attest to that.  A lot of these games feel like exercises -- in a good sense -- where you are put into a somewhat strange situation and deal with somewhat strange parameters to produce a somewhat strange end product.<br/><br/>'Sfunky.                        </div>
