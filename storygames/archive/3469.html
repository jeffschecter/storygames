As I wandered through the expo for the first time, I realized the standard games weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really appealing to me.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve played a lot of games and needed something different.  The Forge, however, did appeal to me.  I picked up games like Primetime Adventures, Breaking the Ice, and A/State.  <br/><br/>Between GenCon 2005 and 2006, my friend got our gaming group involved in playtesting Mob Justice, the newest addition to Contested Grounds\xe2\u20ac\u2122 line-up.  The idea of an America where Prohibition never ended appealed to me.  Impressively, the game went through design, playtesting, and production during that year because I picked up the \xe2\u20ac\u0153rough draft\xe2\u20ac\x9d GenCon edition that following year.  I was deeply impressed with the speed and quality a game can come into being.<br/><br/>Some members of our group didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t initially love the \xe2\u20ac\u0153shared narrative\xe2\u20ac\x9d concepts many of the independent games have opened doors to, but we did appreciate the chance to work on something fresh.<br/><br/>Below are the actual play highlights from our last Episode of Mob Justice (before its release) along with some commentary from our group.  I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m trying to make the format suitable for the forum and apologize if I have not.  In the write-up, I pose a few questions.  I hope some of you who have played this game can share your thoughts on it.</i><br/><br/><br/><div><br/><b>How It Went Down<br/>Prep<br/></b></div><br/>There were five \xe2\u20ac\u0153full\xe2\u20ac\x9d playtest sessions, not counting a session devoted to rules explanation and some test skirmishes and another session (or two) devoted to character creation.  Throughout the five games, eight of us\xe2\u20ac\u201cMike, Mic, Matt, Alan, Scotty, Holly, Sean, and myself\xe2\u20ac\u201ctook various roles.  For example, my friend Alan is a terrific Rules Lawyer.  We generally try to curb that behavior, but for playtests we let it flourish.  Finally, Mike and I took turns as the Boss (I handled 1.1, 1.3, and 1.5).  <br/><br/>Over the course of the first four Episodes, one major story arch was developed.  Our game of Mob Justice centered around two brothers, Samuel and Daniel Isenberg.  These brothers were tied into the Los Angeles political scene.  Samuel was a good man, an idealist.  His brother Daniel appeared to follow in Samuel\xe2\u20ac\u2122s footsteps, but actually delved heavily in various illegal activities.  One of these activities gave Daniel the wrong kind of attention and, in a panic, he framed his brother for it.  This framework brought the characters together, particularly rallying around a trio of player characters while widening around the entire group of eight.  By framework, I mean one of the characters assassinated Samuel Isenberg, creating a catalyst for Daniel Isenberg to use the city\xe2\u20ac\u2122s resources to squelch his competition while appearing to act out of justice.<br/>Isenberg experienced failure after failure, most painfully in arenas of his choosing against people he considered \xe2\u20ac\u0153lesser.\xe2\u20ac\x9d  The Cast wanted to end him, but he continued to get away.  After Isenberg\xe2\u20ac\u2122s last assault on a brothel/speakeasy owned by Holly\xe2\u20ac\u2122s character, the Cast decided to take the right to his doorstep.<br/><b><br/>The Story</b><br/><br/>One thing I noticed when playing Mob Justice was that it appeared to work best with a Boss and three players.  Our most inspired games (three of the five) came from this dynamic.  Have any of you experimented with the size of your gaming groups for this game?  What did you find?  For that matter, do any of you experiment with the size of your gaming groups for any of your games?  I attempt to do this with every playtest or regular session I take part in.<br/><br/>For the final session, I brought the majority of the group in to wrap up the game.  Our cast looked like this:<br/><br/><i>Tullio Costa, a man in the making (Mike)<br/>Jocelyn Cadenza, a madame and club owner (Holly)<br/>Tomasso Lorenza, an undercover cop (Matt)<br/>Gino \xe2\u20ac\u0153Big Gene\xe2\u20ac\x9d Vanzetti, a bootlegger (Alan)<br/>Salvatore Messina, a mess (Scotty)<br/>Anthony Morelli, a bootlegger (Mic) <br/></i><br/>Besides Daniel Isenberg, only one character should be mentioned: August September, a hitman.  In fact, his assignment was responsible for igniting the powder keg.  When I played in a game instead of running it, this is the character I used.<br/><br/>The initial scene centered around the trio\xe2\u20ac\u201cAugust, Tullio, and Jocelyn\xe2\u20ac\u201cwho took part in each of the five games.  The three of them worried about what to do with their captives.  August made suggestions, but Tullio basically let the group know he wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t taking orders anymore, especially from a madame and hitman.  Neither Jocelyn nor August felt the urge to argue.  Once Tullio felt his point was cemented, he went ahead and followed August\xe2\u20ac\u2122s suggestion.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, Tomasso, an undercover cop, has been sold out by his \xe2\u20ac\u0153friends\xe2\u20ac\x9d on the force.  Isenberg catches him in his apartment where they murder his girlfriend and promise to do worse to his wife.  Tomasso agrees to help put down Samuel Isenberg\xe2\u20ac\u2122s assassin.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
