Dakota went to see Tia, who was living in a cave, hiding out after the PC Chosen and Dakota and the PC Infernal fought her, causing her to lose her crap job and having nowhere to go.<br/><br/>Dakota offered Tia a place to crash. She suggested "getting inside, having a Tombstone or something", Tia asked if Dakota could cook. I immediately answered in character, "Oh yeah, my mom's been dead for a while. I've got four... three brothers and I take care of them." And in that moment, I answered like Dakota would answer, she reflexively said four, but in seconds, she recalled that Luke was murdered by a hunter a few nights ago and corrected herself. It was this tip of the tongue thing, I didn't feel like Dakota would flinch outwardly even thought the correction hurt. The fact that we were on Google Hangouts and out of the corner of my eye, I saw Steve, one of the other players, wince was incredibly satisfying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403007/#Comment_403007" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T07:36:23+00:00" title="January  8, 2013  7:36AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Somehow in <i>Owl Hoot Trail </i>we ended up fighting a bear that was on fire in a hay loft.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403039/#Comment_403039" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T12:43:04+00:00" title="January  8, 2013 12:43PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2013 12:43PM by Mark_Causey.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Owl ... bear</blockquote>\nFixed that for you<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403040/#Comment_403040" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T12:44:21+00:00" title="January  8, 2013 12:44PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Fiasco</i>: Flight 1180 was trending pretty well until the Federal Air Marshall on the plane realized his gun was missing and used a fire extinguisher to subdue an unruly passenger.

She became a way to satiate his hunger, and he wasn't easily broken if she wolfed out. It worked, but there was so much strife in their relationship! He was an ex-jock, she was a trailer park druggie. He had a temper nearly as bad as hers. He was crushin pretty hard on the boy fae Gail, and she was fairly possessive.<br/><br/>Then Cole died, and his dad remade him to be Cage. New memories, new boy, didn't remember Cassidy at all (cause his dad hates her) and even had a built in girlfriend (an NPC chosen named Jade). The cliche fights ensued for a few sessions, but shit hit the fan when Cage slept with Jade because he thought Cassidy was sleeping with Gail. And then when she felt their spirit connection break, Cassidy DID sleep with Gail. ALL SORTS OF GREAT DRAMA HAPPENED, including the fae going into his darkest self for the first time this session and cause all sorts of harm to Cassidy for breaking little promises to him left and right.<br/><br/>Last night, Cage and Cassidy might've made up except a few key things happened. His phone accidentally dialed her when Cage and Jade were sexin it up. She had a spirit vision (which happens on our games on the full moon for my werewolf) where she was given the choice between Cage and Cole and she chose Cole, which just fueled her She Wolf rage. Cage's dad offered her a deal, I'll heal your Mom (her mom has MS) if you stay away from Cage, and I'll even sweeten the deal by erasing your memories of him.<br/><br/>She agreed, but couldn't go through with it without one last call to Cage. She found out earlier that day he was avoiding her because he helped her out with a plot point. That made her even sadder. She explained the deal Cage's dad gave her, and he told her to take it, knowing regardless of what they used to have or might've had, her mom was more important. Cassidy agreed, and said "well, bye I guess. Say hi to me at school." I was tearing up in real life. AND THEN CASSIDY HAD HER MEMORIES OF HER AND COLE ERASED. All she remembered is that he had died, and she had mourned for him.<br/><br/>Everybody was so quiet and sad at the table. It was like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind just happened in front of us. Everything I loved about teen drama, memories of self and relationships in sci-fi, and tragic romance happened all at once. I dunno, I guess it was just pretty intense because we had actually gone through so much relationship drama at the table with the string mechanics, it felt like the end of an actual relationship. It was so great.<br/><br/>And this was just my character arc last night! We also had a mermaid posing as a boy who was trying to be a real person and stole our selkie's pelt, a mysterious dark man made out of smoke in a trenchcoat has the ability to possess our fae Gail, and a new PC chosen joined our group, Jackson. He thinks we're all cray cray, and he tried to kill Gail and Cage!<br/><br/>I <img alt="&lt;3" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/heart.png" title="&lt;3"/> Monsterhearts!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403662/#Comment_403662" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T10:21:32+00:00" title="January 14, 2013 10:21AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I finally got together with my old D&amp;D group and successfully transitioned our long-running campaign (20+ years old, played slowly) into a Dungeon World game. We wrote up custom playbooks for two of the simplest characters (a fighter/thief and a monk) and advanced them enough to flesh them out accurately. Then I started asking them questions to frame the scene, telling them not to worry about continuity with our previous sessions (years ago now). Together we painted a Middle Eastern setting not unlike something from Assassin's Creed, to which I added some dreamlike elements. I had very little idea where things might go, and did a lot of following the fiction, which worked great. My friends struggled a little to let go of old ways, but really got the flow of DW by the end, which was a climactic fight with a powerful rakshasa that tied into our last session's story. They had a great time, and I don't think we'll be waiting so long for our next session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403689/#Comment_403689" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-14T17:37:47+00:00" title="January 14, 2013  5:37PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 14, 2013 5:49PM by nemomeme.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My Sunday group had our penultimate session in our ongoing Monsterhearts game. <br/><br/>The 3 PCs who were not The Mortal (me, who unlocked the moves) got some "Growing Up Moves" and there were some great payoffs from all the narrative we'd built up over the previous sessions.  <br/><br/>One of the cool things was my PC's Infernal Lover removed the Condition of "Filthy" from me via his newly gotten <b>Share Your Pain</b> GU move. His Dark Power, "The Poisoner," had gotten a couple of Strings on my PC from his sex move and was basically trying to break us up and/or make me feel awful because I was trying to break the Dark Power's hold over my lover. Our MC, Christian, had just spent a String to give my PC that Condition (naturally resulting in the cry-and-scrub-yourself-clean-in-the-shower scene). Breaking us up just then might have worked if the Infernal hadn't just grown up a little (he had been pretty selfish and immature at times).<br/><br/>There was some really dark material with the trying-to-be-sweet/normal Werewolf losing control and getting a little non-consensually violent with the Hollow in their first sexual (and consensual) encounter. A tabula rasa trying to learn how things work, that's now her baseline for that kind of activity. Super. Messed. Up. We were all shaking our heads at the pathos and the horror and David said something like, "and somewhere in the night, the mcdaldo... laughs."<br/><br/>Looking forward to our final session to see where things end up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403723/#Comment_403723" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-15T06:52:56+00:00" title="January 15, 2013  6:52AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The players in my STALKER game last night spent a lot of time trying to figure out what to do with the bad luck that had come into their possession.<br/><br/>The Institute kindly offered to take it off their hands, no questions asked, but they declined.

One of the nearest islands is a smoking volcano, which errupts during the game. The mainland itself has a couple of old food factories -- one used to create/package peanut butter, the other used initially to create/package Spam but later Twinkies. <br/><br/>Social structure: Children rule. The younger you are, the more power you have. Teenagers, sensing that they are getting to the age where their social standing will soon fade, make occasional (unsuccessful) power grabs. Adults who bare children are "allowed" to live on one of the smaller off-shore islands. Childless adults remain on the mainland and serve as slaves to the ruling children. <br/><br/>Driving forces: Power and Chia Pets. These kids were obsessed with Chia Pets. So much so, that they restrucured part of the shore to better grow the important grassy hair from Chia seeds. <br/><br/>Funniest moments: <br/>* When young Britta (six years old) started a selfish project to get the savage predator lionesses trained by her fellow children so they could hold a Lioness Parade. The next turn, a card told us that a project fails, so we got to draw lionesses gnawing on little limbs. <br/>* When we held a discussion about whether we should change our main diet from fish to coconuts, I ended with a bratty, "I HATE COCONUTS!" And then, when we held a discussion about whether we should change our main diet back to fish, I ended with a bratty, "I HATE FISH!" (Yes, it was much sillier than my last two Quiet Year games.)<br/><br/>Unusual circumstances: A good (?) omen was seen early in the game -- a glowing pink snake. However, later, several other glowing snakes were seen, which did not prove so lucky. Particularly when they bit three pregnant teenagers, killing them and causing them to immediately give birth to (living) babies. Each baby was the glowing color of the snake that had killed its mother (blue, green or violet) and each rapidly aged in the span of days. <br/><br/>Observations: I have never seen so many Contempt tokens taken.

Taking injuries is so much worse than getting a plain ol' double-damage critical hit, and it allows me as the GM to dismember PCs.

Early on in the game, we were rolling terribly. The moss I created died a quick death: it overextended itself, had part of the rock it was growing on crack and fall off, flipping over to hide it from the sun. A tern got eaten by an owl. The ground was too hard by the time walnuts fell from the walnut tree, so no seedlings. The only major success was the dead human body that one player introduced (skirting the edges of my "no humans" rule), which was a feast for maggots and beetles. By the end, the simplicity of the this version of the mechanics was leading to a bit of boredom (I could tell when people introduced a honey badger and a ghost), but there's enough here that I'm pretty sure non-fiction, character-less games can totally work.

What struck me most was how much we developed the character of the Teacher: I feel like we projected a lot of our actual horror stories about teaching into him, and as a result we created a bullied, lonely man, unable to change jobs due to the poor market and the dying need for his film photography skills. There were strong hints of suicidal tendencies after the death of his mother, and a brief and tragic love affair with a woman from the City.<br/><br/>It was a great game that moved between table-top and semi-larp (which mostly happened whenever we dealt with the machine). I loved how the exchange of Fortune and Explain cards kept giving us different perspectives and emotional reactions on the world and on our characters. (Noteworthy? We were playing the last publicly released version, and I was the only player to use the 'narrate your inner monologue' option from the Narrator card.)<br/><br/>The freakiest part came when the first of us went through the machine ... and found the Teacher's lover on the other side. For a while, we (as players) hesitated about going back, unsure how to handle introducing an NPC into the game. But eventually we found an elegant solution.<br/><br/>Things didn't end well for our group of friends. I was dragged back from the City, screaming and protesting. That split us apart: two of us obsessed with rebuilding the Machine, and another of us wanting to forget everything about the City which meant he had to have nothing to do with us.<br/><br/>Definitely looking forward to playing the next version, <a href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">@jackson_tegu</a>!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404167/#Comment_404167" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T18:36:15+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  6:36PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">@Mike_Sands</a>, I want to know what those weird slug aliens in the bottom right are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404172/#Comment_404172" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-20T19:49:06+00:00" title="January 20, 2013  7:49PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><a href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">@Mike_Sands</a>, I want to know what those weird slug aliens in the bottom right are.</blockquote>\nWe never really found out!

It was very laid-back, quite natural, and it was great to see how the sex moves between the Witch, the Werewolf and the Fae fired off at each other - creating what would have been a nicely functional relationship if the Witch hadn't broken a promise to the Fae in the very next scene.<br/><br/><i>Highlight 2</i>: The Selkie breaks in to the Infernal's McMansion, trying to find his pelt. It's not there, but the swimming pool starts whispering to the Selkie that it knows the Infernal's secrets, that it embraced and surrounded the Infernal while he was swimming and took knowledge from him. It quickly becomes clear that the water in the pool feels like it's imprisoned, cut off from nature, and has basically become creepy and insane. <br/><br/>The Selkie wants to know the secrets, so he takes off his clothes, slips into the water, blows his Gaze Into the Abyss roll and goes Darkest Self.<br/><br/>I tell the player to think of themselves as Jaws, now.

To his credit, the first person he looked for was his fiance (NPC) Angelina, who was with (NPC) Lord Mace. They were being attacked by invisible monsters.<br/><br/>Victor (thinking to himself): He's presumably put up a barrier around himself and Angelina. (recalls that Lord Mace's magic requires breaking social taboos and that Lord Mace's favored tactic involves orgies) Curse you, Lord Mace!<br/><br/>But, he lost no time rescuing the two. After all, he didn't want Lord Mace using any more magic than absolutely necessary. At that point, Victor got quite curious about the invisible monsters.<br/><br/>Victor: Do they become visible when dead?<br/><br/>GM: Yes.<br/><br/>Victor: Oh, isn't that interesting? Oh -- Angelina, are you all right?<br/><br/>Victor then asked Lord Mace if he could use magic to locate Alice, Lord Mace's fiance. Victor wasn't keep on Lord Mace getting at all intimate with Angelina, but did remind Lord Mace that he'd kissed Victor once to do some minor magic.<br/><br/>Lord Mace: Are you suggesting that I have an orgy with you and your fiance to find my fiance?<br/><br/>Victor (with alacrity): No.<br/><br/>Lord Mace: Pity. I thought it was a lovely idea. If you will forgive the insult, there is a reason that civilized folk like you do not dabble in magic, Mr. Knight.<br/><br/>Victor: The insult is forgiven.<br/><br/>Eventually, everyone regrouped, dealt with invisible monsters and visible warriors, and, ultimately, the poor schmuck who was being possessed by the new Martian race. The fellow fell off the island, obviously dying, as No One Could Have Survived That, and the Kerberans currently have a floating island. This is probably temporary, although it is amusing to ponder whether they can stash the (about 4 miles in diameter) island in the Kerberos Club, which has an Aspect of Worst. Filing. System.

I mean, how could it not. Now its even more dramatic, because of the emo tension of lost memories and growing up and doing the right thing. Despite Cage and Cassidy now trying to give no fucks, the other players are shipping us and pushing our characters in the most awkward/painful situations ever.<br/><br/>Cage's hunger can still eerily be satiated by sex w/Cassidy. GM makes Cage insanely hungry while Cassidy is around. Hasn't happened yet, but waiting for that creepy scene.<br/>Cage insists on keeping Cassidy's memories intact, while Gail and Rowan push to telling her the truth. Constant conversation awkwardness.<br/>Cage Rowan (selkie) and Gail (fae) had a threesome (!!!! WHAT) under Cassidy's trailer after a rough night of saving Cage's father and sister from death kind of. Yea that happened. The morning after, Rowan had to meet up with Jackson (chosen) before school to discuss the loss of Jackson's virginity to a mermaid/man who stole his "manhood". Gail was leaving early to sabotage Cage's relationship with Jade (npc chosen) because we suspect she's hunting the group, and she'll totally break up with Cage once Gail tells her he's slept with him. That left Cassidy to babysit Cage before school, and they talked like it was old times but it wasn't old times and it was so sad. Jade kept texting Cage, and he kept ignoring her texts, and Cassidy had this great line where she was like "Why are you dating her anyway? She's so controlling and aggressive and she's just using you anyway." Which was basically what Cassidy did in their relationship. Poor Cage.<br/><br/>MONSTERHEARTS = DRIVE THAT DAGGER DEEPER<br/><br/>One thing mechanically that I find really satisfying about long term play in this game is that the moves really do flow with the game. Now that we've got a good handle on them, it's really easy to craft a scene and create drama and know the exact moment to push with a move or draw things out uncomfortably before the next storm of moves. Also, advancement is really satisfying, and all of us discuss the ways our characters are developing and growing and we all want to <b>play to find out more about our characters</b>.

anomaly they've dubbed "the sunspot" when Beard clips a mosquito mange, which pulps his left arm and cartwheels him into the ground like a ragdoll, snapping his C6 vertebra. The teens freak out. Federal, a physician, realizes they will need a backboard and cervical collar if Beard has even a chance of not being permanently paralyzed. Hicks suggests they return to the military door, but a quick scan of the map reveals McCarran hospital not too far away - abandoned in the Zone for 13 years, but it'll have what they need. So they calm down the teens and leave them to keep watch over Beard while they head for McCarran. After some tense adventures they get a backboard and collar in the spooky, silver-web-filled hospital, and start back. But there's this cloud all of a sudden, and it is moving toward them. They figure they can beat it to the Chinese restaurant parking lot where Beard is laying (it's a slow cloud) but realize it is going to cut them off. So they flip around and run back to the hospital, devil take the hindmost. And the cloud doesn't follow, it fixates on the teens and poor Beard, and it envelops them and sucks all the iron out of their bodies.

Monrad came down to tent city on our hot, windswept world and demanded that Marre surrender.<br/><br/>Sgt. Monrad: I'm here to arrest you for the murder of Lora Kidd.<br/><br/>Marre: Are you sure that's a good idea?<br/><br/>Sgt. Monrad: Yes. You're here by yourself, and I've got 10 armed marines.<br/><br/>Marre: That's the problem with you authority types. You spend all your time looking down on us, and you miss what's below the surface.<br/><br/>He clapped. And the fallen tents all around pulled back to reveal an army of convicts.
