There were radscorpions a la Fallout, roaming biker gangs following a warlord child, partially sand-covered cities to loot for pre-apocalypse gear and art, a weird super-addictive drug called <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com/forums/index.php?topic=513.msg4665" rel="nofollow">Myth</a>, and a lady whose insides were made entirely of ash.<br/><br/>The second one was intended to be a one- or two-shot demo for a group of people coming together from three different social circles; for some it was an intro to roleplaying, to others it was an intro to Apocalypse World, to others it was an intro to anything-but-D&amp;D. The campaign actually ran on for something like 10-12 sessions before concluding. I used the Hatchet City setup, but Hatchet City was the remnants of Toronto after Lake Ontario flooded (it's apparently a tradition for the people I play with to set their games in Toronto - this must've been the fifth game I played in various fantasy versions of it). There were guild/clan wars, mudfish and mudfish parasites, serious alcohol abuse, a strange ascetic cult who worshipped our Brainer (who became possessed by an intelligent strand of moss), floating farm-rafts in the Sovereignty of Sauga, an ancient oracle monolith known only as "TSX", and gunboat raiders brainwashed into frenzy by Blind-Blue, a pet psychic mutant. The psychic maelstrom in this game was the human self-awareness lost in the process of Nature reducing people into instinct-driven savages through various poisons, physical and mental, which drained into a kind of ice-cold intelligent collective unconscious. Eventually a flood of primordial soup reduced Hatchet City into organic goo, and our protagonists scattered into various locations further west.<br/><br/>(this was the game where my wife, playing the freaky brainer, realized she has been married too long and lost all skill of seduction - trying to use her sex move on another PC, she simply brings him into a small room under pretense of wanting to talk to him, closes and locks the door, and announces "I use my sex move on him". So I go, "um, what do you DO?". She looks over at the other player, thoroughly confused, and then goes "um, I guess I, um, take off my clothes? and press myself up against him?" Needless to say, that sex move did not get rolled for. Good times.)<br/><br/>Anyhow, yeah. We don't seem to tend towards classic wasteland, there are always some super weird elements that creep in there. I'd love to try out Kevin's idea of an underground tunnel network sometime. With spiders.<br/><br/>I have your email already <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> and would be happy to do a virtual introduction of my K-W based friend if you like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chroma" title="Chroma"><img alt="Chroma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/534/n1N2ZVK30JJ00.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chroma">Chroma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358575/#Comment_358575" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T18:18:23+00:00" title="February  9, 2012  6:18PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>Anyhow, yeah.
