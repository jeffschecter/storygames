If not, I apologize and any mods should feel free to move it to a more appropriate spot.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, I'm thinking about doing a podcast based around looking the relationship between literary/cultural theory and role-playing.  Part of my planned format is to tackle some of the larger 'meta' issues around theory and I was going to start by talking about the differences between the ways traditional and modern literary theorists have theorized about how stories are produced.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wanted to get an idea of what roleplayers thought about this issue rather than just hypothesizing, and while this is an admittedly unscientific way of doing so, I figured it might be a good baseline, so I thought I'd ask a couple of questions.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) What do you think the main factor(s) are that go into the production of literary and cultural products? (I'm speaking of novels, poems, films, TV shows, etc...anything that involves the creation of a narrative.)<br/>\n<br/>\n2) What do you think the main factor(s) are that go into the production of a story created through role-playing?  Is it similar or different?  How so?<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, just a couple guidelines for the thread.  I'm looking for fairly quick 'gut feelings' about the topic and I'm not looking for 'right' answers, just what you think are the answers.  You also don't have to go into great detail.  Also, I'd prefer that there not be any arguments breaking out in the thread.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyway, thanks to anyone who responds for the help.<br/>\n<br/>\nMichael                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_179798">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/179798/#Comment_179798" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-22T16:41:38+00:00" title="November 22, 2008  4:41PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My hip-shot:<br/><br/>1) The primary creative onus is on a single creative unit, usually a writer. He needs cultural knowledge, conviction, inspiration and project management skills to create something. Depending on the medium there are a bunch of other people whose job is to either listen to instructions from this creative unit, or riff off his work with harmonious creative work of their own.<br/><br/>2) Story is created in the same way in roleplaying: there is a creative unit that just happens to usually consist of several people. The factors are all the same, but the medium is different. Perhaps the most significant individual difference is in the purpose of the act: in roleplaying the purpose of story-creation is almost invariably to entertain ourselves by creating story (not primarily by consuming a story we created, note), while in most other medias the purpose is to create a presentable art object that contains the story. Roleplaying is considered entertainment while other story creation is work exactly because in roleplaying you create a story as pure artistic entertainment for your creative unit, while it takes utmost skill and exceptional circumstances for a creator to get into that same zone of pure creativity-for-sake-of-creativity in other medias.<br/><br/>I'd say more, but I'd be in danger of going into analytical territory.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
