It appeals to me on a sim level: beyond the basic competence level, you usually have to put yourself in a failable situation to learn, and having failed is an unforgeable certificate of being in a failable situation. It speaks to me as a story creator, too: danger, exposure, discomfort, and status revelation are good fiction material, and it's cool if we can incentivize that. And there's a real challenge to putting X World characters into situations where they're likely to fail, too. They're sexy, competent badasses.<br/><br/>Here's how I'd do it. 1XP for a roll of 6-, no matter what. 2XP if you choose to endure duress rather than roll. Maybe add an option to the "Choose 1/3" type rolls that is "Gain 1XP", so you get less of what your character wants, but the character grows a little, gets a scar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350552/#Comment_350552" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T11:32:19+00:00" title="December  5, 2011 11:32AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: mease19</cite>You might consider combining defend and stunt, both involve manipulating the combat space to do something other than damage (i.e. tactics).</blockquote>\nDefend also include Saving Throws, and I really like the idea of those giving out EXP. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350554/#Comment_350554" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T11:35:56+00:00" title="December  5, 2011 11:35AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2011 11:36AM by ccreitz.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also like the "Mark experience" moves, in theory.

I'm playing a Fighter, and last session was the first time I didn't have strength highlighted, instead I had dexterity and charisma highlighted. A horde of lizardmen and goblins were approaching, and I saw that Volley would get me an XP, so I decided to hurl my sword at the biggest lizardman. Since I didn't have my normal weapon anymore, the fight became a lot more dynamic as I was trying to grab weapons off the lizardmen (defying danger in the process) and doing more creative attacks than I would have if I'd been using my normal weapon. So, in at least one instance, the XP difference between ranged and melee attacks contributed to some fun.<br/><br/>Personally I'm growing more and more skeptical of the "get XP when you roll the dice with a highlighted stat" thing. I know I'm forgetting to mark XP sometimes, and listening to The Walking Eye APs they seem to be forgetting, too. I think I'd prefer an end-of-session process where you look back at what happened rather than trying to do bookkeeping in the middle of the action, sort of like evaluating Beliefs in Burning Wheel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_350565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350565/#Comment_350565" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T11:55:27+00:00" title="December  5, 2011 11:55AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Anarchangel</cite>One of the reasons the highlighted stats XP systems (&amp; derivative systems, like this) appeal to me is that it doesn't reward or penalise based on success or failure, it rewards action, regardless of result.

Or, you know, get the tweedy academic into a firefight with cultists... that's cool too.<br/><br/>Don\u2019t forget you can always ask the MC or other players to highlight something you suck at too if you wanted to focus on that as part of the same table dialogue where you talk about highlighting things you don't want to do in the game.<br/><br/>Also even if you don't have something you suck at highlighted, making a move from that is a great way to create opportunities for you to use the moves you do have highlighted. Though even better I like to mix and match - in the first playtest we had the Fighter character with Converse and Attack highlighted, this resulted in him always trying to talk his foes out of fighting and then destroying them when they refused. <br/><br/>Generally though as a personal preference I prefer Dungeon World to be about what the characters are awesome at and the perilous adventures they have, with dashes of "holy crap the fighter totally just missed noticing that trap why did we let him lead the way?". So it is possible that we are talking of different play priorities and styles, though in other games I am totally with you on this \u2013 like Mouse Guard, BW or AW. <br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_350636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/350636/#Comment_350636" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-05T22:20:57+00:00" title="December  5, 2011 10:20PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 5, 2011 10:44PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The interesting you have here is that AW is essentially a drama game (much as is Lady Blackbird), and DW an adventure/travelogue game.

It works for me and those I played with, and as far as a hack goes that's all that matters. If I had the sort of highlighting Creitz suggests for DW, I would turn the game down because I don't care for that in my "kick your face and take your stuff" game.<br/><br/>Which makes me chuckle a bit: are people already trying to make DW do "more than it was designed for," much like people did with old school D&amp;D?<br/><br/>Between that and the hack community that's sprung up around trying to "fix" it, again much like old school D&amp;D, Sage &amp; Adam have fucking won.<br/><br/>Won what, you ask? <em>Achieving the exact experience they seemed to set out for: recreate old school D&amp;D with modern sensibilities.</em><br/><br/>And to that I say: fuck yeah.
