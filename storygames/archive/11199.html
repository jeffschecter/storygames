Well, I'm not sure I would call what we're doing successful yet, but I can run you through some of the details.  <br><br>For all of our projects so far, Jason has been the driving creative force.  That wasn't our initial intent, but he's got a lot of good ideas and we've fallen into something of a pattern.  The ideas are his and he does most (or all) of the writing.  I take several passes at editing his work, trying to help with design ideas, content structure, and generally being a sounding board.  To be fair, we have a lot of folks that help with that.  <br/><br/>In addition, I've generally been the one to deal with printers and distributors as well as handling requests from customers.  Patrick on the other hand has traditionally been our layout and fonts guy, helping us to pull the content together into great books.  Things are a little more complicated now than when we started, in part because Patrick now lives in Maryland, while Jason and I work down the hall from one another.  That means that some things happen really rapidly while other tasks crawl.<br/><br/>(more in a moment)                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248922/#Comment_248922" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T17:01:41+00:00" title="December 28, 2009  5:01PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 29, 2009 6:39AM by Steve_Segedy.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So It's easier for me to think of the things we need to do better than the things we do right, but overall I'm happy with our work.  One of the reasons I say we're not exactly successful is that, like most folks in this community, it's a labor of love, more than a business.  Our goal from the start was to make games without going into debt, and that's always worked out so far.  <br/><br/>By and large all of this works because we're good friends and we enjoy it, but we've never really had a business plan and that's something I'd like to change. If we suddenly started seeing much bigger success, we'd need to get some details nailed down quickly.<br/><br/>From a production perspective, Jason does all the development work, including organizing play-tests, gathering feedback, refining the designs, and so forth.  I try to keep our files organized and stay on top of sales numbers, managing our website and setting up software we need.  We have a private wiki and FTP space where we swap information, and lately we've been making good use of <a href="www.dropbox.com" rel="nofollow">Dropbox</a> while working on <em>Fiasco</em>.<br/><br/>So is that more or less what you were looking for, Ralph?  What problems are you seeing as you go it alone?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248927/#Comment_248927" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T19:20:39+00:00" title="December 28, 2009  7:20PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My problem is that doing everything myself means nothing gets finished.  I've got Blood Red Sands ready for my last pass at the writing before sending to an editor...its been in that state since...September? August?  I'm in the middle of a complete rewrite of Robots &amp; Rapiers...but time spent on that is time not spent on BRS.  I've got a couple of other ideas I'm excited about and I know full well if I don't get the ideas down, they'll be gone forever...but how can I work on those when there's so much else to do.  The reality is that my real world job comes first and between total financial collapse in 2008 and a major corporate merger in 2009...ramping up here through the first couple quarters of 2010...my time is limited to spend on publishing projects...at least if I still want to have a home life.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd much rather be able to get to a point where I can say "Ok, my work on BRS is done.  Its time for someone else to take the ball, arrange for the editing and layout, and usher it through the production process to release".<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not so much concerned with the financial aspect.  Sure, wouldn't it be nice to do it full time and cut back or eliminate the daily wage slave grind...but really...it would just be nice to actually get another game released and out there and being played.  And I'm finding it impossible to coordinate the entire process with the time I have available.  It would be nice to have some folks share the burden...not just on a hired contractor basis...but on a dedicated part of the program basis.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'd love to be at a point where I could say to someone "here's what I do and what I'm committed to completeing, I expect and encourage you to contribute but I'll be doing the heavy lifting" and "here's what I need you to do and committ to completeing.  I'll be available for consultation but you'll be doing the heavy lifting on that"  That way...things might actually get done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_248933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248933/#Comment_248933" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-28T20:27:26+00:00" title="December 28, 2009  8:27PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I know your pain- part of the reason Patrick and I haven't pushed more of our own ideas forward is just being too busy with family and other stuff.  Jason has more free time, since he's just a brain in a jar at the UNC Psychology lab.  We've had a second edition of Grey Ranks in progress for a while now, but life, and then Fiasco, took first priority for a while.  <br><br>That said, we do get some of that trade-off you're looking for- many times when Jason has handed off a project to us for editing, layout, or just to let it rest, he can shift to other games.  There's a lot of stuff on various back-burners for all of us, and we shift it around as time allows.<br><br>I'd really like to find the right project management solution (and by that I'm talking about both a process and a web tool) to help us set tasks and deadlines and communicate more clearly.  The search is ongoing...                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248945/#Comment_248945" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-29T04:55:41+00:00" title="December 29, 2009  4:55AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Speaking of ongoing searches, we also need a version control system we can live with. I'm not asking for suggestions but we're definitely looking. Right now we're still doing "fiasco_cover_v2_28_dec_final_04" nonsense which is embarrassing.<br><br>Working closely with others is a real blessing. Steve very often makes technical suggestions and editing changes that really help my designs and Patrick has a lot more skill at both layout and formatting for production than either of us do. I'm very much looking forward to switching up a bit, though - I know both Steve and Patrick have good ideas I'd like to help shepherd through the process.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
