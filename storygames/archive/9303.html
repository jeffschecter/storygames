I've actually written two RPGs start-to-finish, each with slightly different purposes, and I occasionally toy with the idea of taking the last few steps, cleaning them up, putting some graphic design to work on them, and publishing them (whether free or not being an open question).<br/><br/>But there's a catch: I don't really know how to do any of this. I have poked around trying to find out, gleam what I can, but the whole "indie RPG" community seems so tightly-knit that I feel like I can either wing it, or stand on the outside forever, until I meet one of the "big names" in person, and surreptitiously become their friend, then years down the road casually drop my idea into conversation.<br/><br/>Anyway, everyone here seems pretty friendly, so, can anybody give me some pointers?<br/><br/>-Adam                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206134/#Comment_206134" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T14:41:03+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  2:41PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you looked at the Forge for resources on self-publishing?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206138">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206138/#Comment_206138" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T14:47:53+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  2:47PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perusing the Forge is part of what scared me away from the idea in the first place.

It's not about community in the sense of making friends with famous game designers. But it is about contacting people, preferably face-to-face and getting them enthusiastic about your game.<br/><br/>There are different ways of doing this. Doing things via your own group is good: it lets you playtest all your stuff and they act as ambassadors for your game. Going to conventions is good, too: I've met people at UK conventions who I can invite round to play games.<br/><br/>You could also try talking about your game. That is good. Start a thread about it.<br/><br/>Also, decide what your goals are for your game. Do you just want to get people playing it? Do you want to make money out of it? Do you want to hold it in your hands in print? Be honest about what you want. Any of those are cool.<br/><br/>Where are you, anyway? What's your set-up in terms of location, local gaming group and so forth?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206157/#Comment_206157" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T15:24:30+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  3:24PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Obviously Graham and I disagree here, which is one of the cool things about this forum.

Don't let things like "PDF creation" and "copywrite" get in your way.<br/><br/>If you aren't comfortable with a pdf, use a Word document or plain text. Doesn't matter. And as far as copywrites go, you'd be pretty blessed if someone cared enough to "scoop" your ideas. No one is getting rich in this market, and I'm guessing you are designing games because you want people to play them and enjoy them.<br/><br/>So find the easiest way to get your ideas out on paper and out there for people to play.

I wasn't necessarily saying you should start posting there to "become part of the community" or anything. But it really is a good place to review old threads for advice on how to get your idea for a game into whatever its final form might be. <br/><br/>Making PDFs is easy. Here's a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9rkDpPEOEY" rel="nofollow">video</a> that goes through the basics. <br/><br/>As for the apparent insularity of the community, I'd say that's an illusion. Folks know each other because they've been posting at each other online for years, and/or have met at conventions or whatnot. So...you know...just start talking online or at conventions or whatever, and...boom!...you're part of the community. Heck, you're part of the community right now.<br/><br/>As for people stealing your ideas...well, that's really up to you and what you're comfortable with. I haven't heard of any cases where someone stole a whole game concept from another indie designer, and that's the sort of thing that would probably cause a big kerfluffle online. You could look into the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons website</a> for different licenses, or just put a copyright note in it retaining all rights.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206165/#Comment_206165" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T15:42:00+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  3:42PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 3:42PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So you have two unrelated challenges:<br/><br/>1.  Technical stuff about publishing.  My advice is to take your questions to the Forge publishing subforum.  People will help you there.  Hell,<i> I</i> will help you there.  That's what it is for.  Go ahead and hate the Forge if you want, but that subforum is pure gold.  People ask about file formats and IP issues all the damn time and ther are people who can actually answer because they have been where you are.<br/><br/>2.  Being a part of the community.  My advice is to approach it like you would approach any community.  Be friendly, get involved, offer to help, try new stuff and talk to people, in person if possible.  Chances are the people you perceive as tight knit are actually real friends, who have gamed together and bonded over the pain of botched target numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206173">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206173/#Comment_206173" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T16:01:03+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  4:01PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 7, 2009 4:06PM by Graham.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: deadlytoque</cite>If I start a thread on here about it, what do I say?

Talk a bit about the game and what's cool about it. Then post the link or, even better, the section of text you want feedback on.<br/><br/>About sharing ideas: the general philosophy here is that it's good to talk about your game. People generally don't steal ideas. We've all got too many ideas of our own.<br/><br/>About the "community": it's not a big, centralized thing. I've met Jonathan Walton once, for example, and have never met Ben Lehman. It's more like lots of little communities. So the people I know, for example, are my gaming groups in the UK and various people from UK conventions. Similarly, there are little clusters in Massachussets and New York.<br/><br/>So, I'd say, get involved with a cluster of people near you and people at nearby conventions. That's why I'm asking where you are, by the way.

I have as much fun chatting to them about books and music and movies as I do chatting about story games.<br/><br/>Also, consider changing your user name to your real name. I'm going to have an easier time remembering you as Adam Drew than as deadlytoque, also if I ever meet you at a con, I'll know who you are right away. There's lots of other great benefits to this as well, which I won't go into here.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, you're part of the community right now. If you need help with anything that I'm good at, let me know. At the moment, I can't really offer services, only advice (new baby is taking most of my energy).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206185/#Comment_206185" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T16:33:28+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  4:33PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm an evil old-school forgista about this social scene thing, so my advice about making it in this community is simple: the community is bullshit, only real cooperation that produces results of whatever sort is real. The fact that you get to know the people by sharing their values, goals and projects is a side-effect, of course: I don't know these people because I've worked to know them, I know them because they have similar interests, and thus we cooperate in real, quantifiable, valuable work. I wouldn't know somebody like Jonathan Walton (to pick an arbitrary person who posts at Story Games) from Adam if I didn't like his game design style and his social goals for gaming (misguided and idealistic as he might be at times), which have resulted in us cooperating in interesting ways in the past. Never met the man in real life, still.<br/><br/>That being said, two points about how to make contacts and further your project using the Forge:\n<ul>\n<li>Post in the publishing forum with your questions about practical things and strategy of being a publisher. I'll answer you... in fact, I'm so tired with the misconceptions about copyright that I'll start using a standard rant: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=15184.msg161713#msg161713" rel="nofollow">here's</a> what I wrote in 2005 about why you shouldn't be concerned about people trying to steal your game when you're thinking of posting it for feedback in the Internet. It's still as true as it ever was. I'm happy to discuss this and other issues further, as will many others with much more experience than I have. Forge might seem like a closed club, but in fact we get new people every week, some of which remain to help others; for issues of publishing, as Jason already said, it's superior compared to any other resource I know of.</li>\n<li>If you want feedback on your game, put something up to be critiqued. If you do it here, you'll probably get lots of smart (and smart aleck) people happy to help. If you'll do it at the Forge, you'll get me and a slightly different bunch of people. (I focus on the Forge in my critique work because we get a somewhat more committed type of people there, so the critique won't be wasted on a flake-out as easily.) In fact, if you do post and I miss it, throw me a PM - I take atelier critique somewhat seriously - if somebody really needs it, I'll give anybody a shot once I have an opportune moment.</li>\n</ul>\nThere is a third thing you can do with the Forge, which is talking about gaming in theory and practice, rather than talking about your own projects. In the interests of full disclosure I'll say that I got into Forge this way, rather than either of the above ways. Asking questions about my own design and publishing came later, and even then I'd read so much that I was rather giving advice than asking for it most of the time. Still, the basic principle is solid: share the passion for indepedent rpg design, and the Forge is yours to use. There are no clique-based barriers, except in your mind.<br/><br/>Also, take Graham seriously: your real community are the people you know and play with. Your real market are the people you can market to. Everybody else is just a voice in the Internet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206187">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206187/#Comment_206187" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T16:39:40+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  4:39PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, so I know I talk like I know all these people on the internet, but I've never actually published a game.  What I have done is gone to meetups and conventions where I've talked with folks, played games with with them, playtested stuff I was working on, and the like.  That's how you become a known entity in the community: by talking and playing games with them in person.  The internet is a poor substitute for anything else.  Graham is really onto something there.  And once you kinda know people, it's easier to get attention for the things you do on the internet.<br/><br/>The only other option, really, is to just release material that's so drop-dead awesome that people jump all over it.  This is a lot harder.  Better, like Graham says, is to post your game and ask a couple specific questions.  Like, <i>I really like the game and it really worked when me and my friends played it, but I've got this Trust mechanic that doesn't seem to work right and I'm not sure how to fix it.  What happens is everyone spends their Trust tokens early in the game session and doesn't have any for the big conflict at the end.  How can I fix this?</i>  Then, you'll get at least a dozen people responding to you, trying to help you out.  Maybe one or two will even become interested in the game, so when you post a new version, they might play it with their home groups.<br/><br/>It works like that: building relationships over time, mostly face-to-face but also online, and reciprocity.  If you read my game and tell me how it's broke or posted an Actual Play report, I'm much more likely to remember you as "oh, that's the guy who played my game" and try to help you out as well.  That kinda thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_206215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206215/#Comment_206215" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T21:45:32+00:00" title="May  7, 2009  9:45PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All great feedback.<br/><br/>Thanks all!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206219/#Comment_206219" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-07T22:04:30+00:00" title="May  7, 2009 10:04PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Make friends face to face.

Talk here. Talk on the Forge about the nuts and bolts of publishing, game design and game play. Decide which people are interesting to you, either for what they can offer your efforts in game design, or for whatever reason.</p>\n<p>Then talk to those people.</p>\n<p>That's the hard part. Reaching out and saying "hello there!" I've been making small sprints at this, trying to turn "voices on the internet" into real people whom I have some level of a personal relationship with.</p>\n<p>Here's a thing: Going to GenCon doesn't count as reaching out. You'll meet the people, put faces to names, get a better feel for them, but it's a frenetic weekend. It's like gamer speed-dating. Maybe it's different if you go and you work one of the booths, but if you go as a customer and a gamer, there's just not enough time, even with the after-hours gaming. That said, if you have the time, money and inclination, go to GenCon. It may be frenetic gamer speed-dating, but it's still pretty awesome.</p>\n<p>So, rather than worrying about the community, why don't you tell us about your game? If you're undecided about how you want to handle the copyright thing, start with broad strokes. Tell us what it's about. Tell us what makes it awesome. Chances are, you will fail to articulate the awesome the first time, but if you're lucky, we'll ask the right questions to help you explain why it's so good.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207185">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque" title="deadlytoque"><img alt="deadlytoque" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/deadlytoque">deadlytoque</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207185/#Comment_207185" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T17:15:35+00:00" title="May 13, 2009  5:15PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 13, 2009 5:16PM by deadlytoque.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9346&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">Done</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
