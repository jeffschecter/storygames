My interpretation (and I did not find anything in the rules to contradict this) is yes, hold is held (no pun intended) from one session to the next if not spent.

As a person who's MC'd the game for a while now - let 'em have it.<br/><br/>The Skinner arguably works best over long periods of play, so letting them keep their leashes on people across sessions is not only extremely rewarding for them; but extremely interesting to watch play out in the long run. Besides - how the hell do you expect to burn through 3 hold as intended in <i>one whole session?</i> Seems bonkers to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_481294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481294/#Comment_481294" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-03-25T16:15:31+00:00" title="March 25, 2019  4:15PM">March 25</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 25, 2019 4:16PM by David_Berg.">edited March 25</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd ask the group.  Specifically, I'd check on the potential problem case where, the way the fiction plays out, it's not obvious how that influence would last.<br/><br/>For me personally, I'd say, "No, they're mesmerized <i>now</i>, do what you will with that <i>now</i>."  But I should admit that I don't like that move because it feels artificial to me, and that my treatment of it is designed to minimize that artificiality.  <br/><br/>This is something I prefer to discuss with the whole group before anyone has finished creating their Skinner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_481869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/481869/#Comment_481869" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2019-04-11T16:18:46+00:00" title="April 11, 2019  4:18PM">April 11</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just caught this thread now, for some reason.<br/><br/>I see absolutely no reason not to make the hold lasting - there\u2019s no rule that says it expires at the end of the session (moves which do specify this).<br/><br/>Keep in mind that, with \u201chypnotic\u201d, it\u2019s the MC who spends the hold (at least most of the time), not the player.<br/><br/>It\u2019s your job as the MC to try to spend the hold freely and basically as much as you can - it\u2019s not something to hoard. Give the player (and the PC) their due, and keep being a fan.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
