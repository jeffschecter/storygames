In Left Coast, you play semi-famous science fiction authors living in late 1960s California. The game\u2019s inspired by the lives of people like Philip K. Dick and L. Ron Hubbard. <br/><br/><a href="www.1km1kt.net/rpg/left-coast" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Download Left Coast from 1000 Monkeys, 1000 Typewriters." src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F9GgJ23_LAs/TVzkIBecB5I/AAAAAAAAACc/_WRsSpWTxpc/s640/Left+Coast+cover+%25284%2529.JPG" style="border: 0px;"/></a><br/><br/>As an author, you try to balance writing with dealing with your everyday lives and problems (marriage, children, rent) and the struggle to not go nuts under the strain of your immense creativity. <br/><br/>And your situation is complicated by the fact that one of your friends is writing a novel about you, \u2026 and either their plot is bleeding over into your real life or you are slowly becoming aware you might be a fictional character. As a game of Left Coast plays out, you will gradually become enmeshed in an web of weird and unnatural forces \u2013 forces who have a plan designed to upset your already-unstable life.<br/><br/>Left Coast is a game for 2-4 players that involves some co-GMing.  It\u2019s designed to promote a relaxed exploration of character and setting, with the occasional flash of meta-narrative, post-modernism, and nuttiness.<br/><br/>Play is divided into chapters or short stories, and every author sets a goal that they\u2019re trying to achieve during that chapter. You can probably play a self-contained short story of Left Coast in 2 or 3 hours, with the option to continue the game for longer (probably between 3 to 6 sessions).<br/><br/>Thanks to Jonathan Walton for running the Festival of Flawless Victory, which got me restarted on this project. This is a very rough draft: very much in the spirit of the Ronnies, I've thrown it together as quickly as possible in order to avoid procrastinating about writing it. I'm fairly sure it's playable, though - and I intend to try it out in the next few weeks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329316/#Comment_329316" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-13T00:57:25+00:00" title="June 13, 2011 12:57AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2011 1:05AM by Steve_Hickey.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The image, above, is a link to the download.

I'm really trying to do the concept justice, and execute it as well as possible.

How about we keep this thread for general impressions and things that you think are interesting; I'd be keen to hear how you think the game's evolved. And then we can use the Forge thread for more hard-core discussion.<br/><br/>I think you're right, though: what I need to do next is playtest it (and hear about other people's playtests - which would be freakin' awesome) and build up my own sense of how the game plays and whether I'm happy with that.

All other NPCs should be owned by players other than the GM or the current player. Hopefully this will address my concern about making sure players remain involved when they're not the GM or spotlighted author in a scene.<br/><br/><br/><b>CONFLICT GUIDES</b><br/>Another way of making sure players remain engaged is to have the players who aren\u2019t participating in the scene or any conflicts be the ones who guide the 'Conflict' conversation, making sure that the participants\u2019 motivations are clear and what type of conflict it is.<br/><br/><br/><b>ADDING REAL PEOPLE TO MONEY SCENES</b><br/>When playing Money scenes (where we play out the Author writing a story), the characters in the story should be analogues for real people in the authors' lives. I need to add that to the procedure for playing Money scenes.<br/><br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>There\u2019s also a rules summary available, which might be helpful for playtests.

I've had a good look at the game and while I think you've done a grand job I think 'nuttiness' isn't a great word.  I see what you're driving at with that concept but think the word you're using is potentially a bit prejudiced.  <br/><br/>Having read a lot of Dick's work and the biographies I think you're making light of something serious.  I think I also felt this when I saw Linklater's 'A Scanner Darkly'  The characters played by Woody Harrelson, Robert Downey Jr and Rory Cochrane are all rather comedic in the film.  I had a completely different experience when I read the book.  Certainly Charles Freck (played by Cochrane) comes across as deeply paranoid and potentially mentally ill in a disturbing way.  <br/><br/>I worry that in doing this you might be making light of both mental illness and also creating an 'RPG for laffs' rather than a potentially very powerful experience.<br/><br/>EDIT - I've used the word 'potentially' potentially too much in this post.
