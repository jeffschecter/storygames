For the same reasons they use them.

Thigns which make flow harder to achieve are distractions and disinterest.  I hope that a game that focuses heavilly on character goals and paces the story to lead to them will tackle disinterest.  I hope that rules that are easy to assimilate and have a light touch will not distract.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>I also wonder what systems are in place for generating a setting and situation since the game is generic. How does everyone get on the same page?</blockquote>\nI have that covered - players first agree on a premise that is structured in a certain way and referenced constantly during character creation.  Please see the 2nd draft for details.  do you think that has it covered?<br/><br/><a href="http://ingenero.wordpress.com/downloads/" rel="nofollow">INGENERO DOWNLOADS</a>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>The character sheet worries me a bit (but I haven't played or seen the rest of the game so maybe it's fine).

Goals I have covered I believe, but Motivations are hard.   currently I have a list of examples for each category which helps somewhat, but its still unsatisfactory.  there is a certain art to motivating a group of characters such that they take aim at each other as well as 'the world'.  <br/><br/>the solution I am working on at the moment is to replace the list of examples with a list of questions.
