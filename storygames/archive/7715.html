People will generally respond positively to my game pitches, but then when it comes to finding an evening, taking part in online character generation etc. I get a lot of radio silence. I live in a quite small town which is part of the problem. I suspect it would be quite easy for me to find a 4e group for instance, but that's not what I'd like to play right now.<br/>So, time and time again I find myself thinking about playing with \u201dnon-gamers\u201d. And every time, my plans stop as soon as I start to think about the particulars: which game, how to sell the idea etc.<br/><br/>So, I'd really appreciate if some of you could tell me if you'vr had similar issues. And how you solved them.<br/><br/>In particular, I'd like to find out how much to tell people about the games beforehand: I don't want to bog people down with all sorts of details, but on the other hand, I want to be upfront and honest and thereby, hopefully, get the right kind of people. I'm thinking that describing the atmosphere and the kind of stories these games offer is better than detailing all sorts of rules \u2013 but, otoh, I don't want to end up with players who'll balk at even simple rules.<br/><br/>Also \u2013 what games are great for this purpose? <br/><br/>Thanks in advance, people!<br/><br/>Peter                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_171407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171407/#Comment_171407" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T04:51:40+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  4:51AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2008 4:52AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe you are over-thinking it, Peter.  Roleplaying is an activity like anything else - would you invite people over to play a board game?  To watch a movie?  How would you pitch that?<br/><br/>"I'd like to have you over to play a board game this Saturday.  It'll be fun!"<br/><br/>I'd make it a one-time deal with no expectations.<br/><br/>In my experience, people completely new to roleplaying are excellent players.  You don't really need to explain how things work too much, because they will understand stuff like author stance and scene framing pretty naturally, and game-specific behaviors just require a little modeling - you go first and they will catch on.  I'd offer to run something you love and not worry about complexity - most people's first game is D&amp;D, and that seems to work out all right.<br/><br/>"I have this game where you make up a TV show and play out episodes, and I'd like to have you over to play this Saturday.

They all like food, so we turned it into a dinner party using the suggestions in the book for things to cook or bring.  If you choose to go this route, I'd be happy to send you the recipes I used.  I think turning it into a dinner party really greased the wheels and I can't recommend that approach enough.  I'll also say that these folks were primed by a recent foray into one of those How To Host A Murder Mystery deals.<br/><br/>In the past, I've had pretty good experiences with just doing what Jason suggested and inviting people over to try and play.  The thing to keep in mind is that you can't really prime someone to be an excellent roleplayer or whatever.  It's like anything else, you offer them the opportunity and if they like it, they'll develop into someone you (hopefully) enjoy playing with.  If they don't like it, or if they don't enjoy playing the same things/way as you do, that's okay too.  Trying to front-load the situation too much won't help.<br/><br/>Regards,<br/>Daniel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_171435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton" title="Gregor Hutton"><img alt="Gregor Hutton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gregor%20Hutton">Gregor Hutton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/171435/#Comment_171435" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-26T07:41:08+00:00" title="September 26, 2008  7:41AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16200" rel="nofollow">Dread</a> works well like this I think, since it's like an evening of self-entertainment with Jenga.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.indiepressrevolution.com/xcart/product.php?productid=16197" rel="nofollow">Contenders</a> works pretty well too with people completely new to gaming.

On the other hand, if your players are people that don't sit still well, or don't like number, stick with something lighter (Buffy comes to mind).  <br/>\n<br/>\nI'd also watch the time.  Running a 5+ hour marathon game might work for some people, but most, in my experience, like something thats no more than 3-4 hours for their first time trying the game.  You can get more time in if you take a meal break though.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust my thoughts.
