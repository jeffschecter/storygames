These are fun.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you know me at all, you know that I've talked about <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2718" rel="nofollow">Culling My RPG Collection</a>: I have "two shelves" (now that I keep my RPGs in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=8230" rel="nofollow">these Ikea cube-things</a>, the equivalent space is 4-5 "cubes"). Even though I've culled off games one year, only to buy them again in a future year when inspired to actually use them (nWoD Vampire; L5R 1st Edition; Aberrant; and I've sold Continuum twice, bought it three times), there are some games that stay on my inglorious collector's shelf, the one cube I have hollowed out and turned into my "trophy case", the RPGs that I probably will not touch again (or at least, not for a long while) but keep around because I simply can't let them go. <br/><br/>Here are my games. What are yours? And any interesting stories about any of them?<br/>(not including my J-RPGs, which are a story all their own)<br/><b><br/>The ones I plan on playing again someday, one day, long from now:</b><br/><br/>Blue Planet 2e and all supplements: Love the world. Now that I know more about setting up situation beforehand, I want to give this another go sometime.<br/>The End (d20 Lost Souls edition; although I have the original on my shelf, too): The best post-apoc game out there. Even the d20 version does things that d20 wasn't meant (at the time) to do, and well at that. Fantastic read, too.<br/>Over The Edge: A classic. Honestly, I'm waffling on running this again, but I figure it would be good for a one-shot at some point.<br/>Conspiracy of Shadows, 1st Edition: I definitely consider this the stronger release of the two editions. A fantastic game, I want to run a campaign of it again at some point. (or maybe the new edition, if it looks like it returns to the roots)<br/>Rifts (Wormwood, Juicer Uprising, Africa): Hell no, not on its own. But using another system, I want to do either Wormwood or the Juicer Uprising. Africa is a pile of shit, but I'd like to re-imagine it at some point into a COOL Rifts-like setting.<br/>The Whispering Vault: Like OTE, I'm waffling on whether I'll actually run/play it again: DreadTFBOP really does well everything I loved about Whispering Vault, and better. But whatta game.<br/>The Riddle of Steel: Will run again sometime. If I'm feeling especially courageous, I'll actually use the magic rules from that game.<br/>GURPS 4th Edition: Will give it another whirl at some point, using Lite options only.<br/>Feng Shui: Love the game, system is dated as balls. Need to rework the core die mechanic, but I want to play again someday.<br/><br/><b>The ones I have no intention of ever playing again, but I can't seem to let go (mostly as reading resources):</b><br/><br/>GURPS Voodoo: I gave up/sold all of my other GURPS books, even Reign of Steel, but I can't seem to let go of this one. GURPS tried to do its own World of Darkness. A neat niche product.<br/>Planescape (all supplements, lots signed by Tony DiTerlizzi): <br/>Skull and Bones: TS Luikart's writing is phenomenal in here, and I love the pirate stories. Otherwise, it's just d20 pirates. Hum.<br/>Continuum: Probably the best read in an RPG I've ever had. Phenomenal world, great read, super premise, shitty system. WiIl never try to play it again, but it's a great read. Same with Narcissist (which has an even *worse* system, but still great writing and concepts).<br/>Artesia: It is Pretty.<br/>BESM d20: It, too, is pretty. Plus it's the full-color "collector's item" version. Great art, no resale value, might just keep on to it as a piece-in-time reminder of like how awesomely things went wrong at GoO.<br/>Sengoku: Great resource for Japanese-style roleplaying. As a game, it kinda falls down though, suffering from "But what do I *do* with it?". Still, when I set a game in historic Japan, I use this book a lot.<br/>Dungeons and Dragons: Kingdom of Nithia: Awesome take on ancient Egypt. Love the art inside as well, especially for the Egyptian-style warrior subclasses.<br/>Dread: The First Book of Pandemonium, 1st Edition: You want my copy of Dread? Fuck you. You can't have it.<br/>Advanced Dungeons and Dragons, 2nd Edition: While I had and played Star Frontiers and Paranoia before I got AD&amp;D 2E, this was the game that made me a Gamer For Life, back sophomore year of high school. Spent more time in that book than any other, I'd wager, even though even today I still can't find a good explanation on how to make an attack roll. :-)  Still, great concept art, and it basically drove a decade of awesome adventures with friends.<br/><br/>If time worked differently, I'd also have a copy of the TORG boxed set on that "never playing again, but keeping" shelf, with the Cyberpapacy, Nile Empire and Orrorsh sourcebooks. Oh, and the original Dark Sun boxed set, with Will and the Way, Veiled Alliance, and Earth,Air,Fire and Water.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197391/#Comment_197391" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T10:00:15+00:00" title="March 17, 2009 10:00AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, when did they release Narcissist?!

If I ever get around to running with this, I might just use HeroQuest (the new to-be-published "Quest Worlds" edition of the game, probably).<br/>* RuneQuest, 2nd edition. I have all the Moon Design reprint books, and there's a wonderful campaign sitting there waiting to be played. The problem is which rules set to use? The answer might end up being the new BRP rules, but there are bits I'd like to keep from RQv2, and bits from RQv3. I'm not sure I really want to use HeroQuest for it. This last bullet might also fall into the "keeping but probably will never get to" category.<br/><br/><b>Games I'm keeping but probably will never get played</b><br/>* Some other BRP stuff (RingWorld, Superworld, Hawkmoon, for example).<br/>* Anything I own by FGU, most probably (Daredevils, Bushido, Aftermath, C&amp;S, Space Opera, Flashing Blades, etc).<br/>* Burning Empires; I'd really like to <i>play</i> in a BE game, but I'm not sure I know anyone in my gaming circle who would like to run it (and who'd be really interested in running it); the same almost certainly goes for Burning Wheel (I tried running it for a year; we all seemed to have fun, but in the end, the game remained a mystery to us, pretty much).<br/>* Dying Earth<br/>* Lyonesse (in French, by a Swiss company, that produced the rulebook and a screen, and promptly vanished); this is one of my favourite fantasy settings, far more than the DE setting, and the rulebook as a setting guide is fabulous: art, maps, acres and acres of description. In French. Getting through it is possible for me, but a bit of a slog.<br/>* All my Tekumel stuff: have most of the TOME stuff, some of the books published by the guys who did Different Worlds, and have the hardback rulebook by Guardians of Order. They're lovely to pore over, but I'm not sure I'd ever fell comfortable running a Tekumel game. There was a fellow who serialized his campaign in Alarums &amp; Excursions for months, and his submissions kept me participating in A&amp;E for a year longer than I might have.<br/>* All my D&amp;D Cyclopedia/Gazeteer era stuff. If D&amp;D4E hadn't come along, then it's entirely possible I would have put this on the table at some point; but the 4e stuff is very fun, for now. It's possible that I might some day use the Mystara background as the setting for a 4E campaign (Hollow World and all), but I rather doubt it.<br/><br/>I'm really not clearing out any of my RPG stuff (other than bits and bobs: gave away my Jorune set to a friend last night, for example) until the Boardgamegeek fellows launch rpggeek... I'm hoping that once that gets off the ground, my collection will get enumerated there and slowly dispensed with. But in the meantime, the collection does need to be collated and re-packed for more sensible storage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197405/#Comment_197405" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T10:38:21+00:00" title="March 17, 2009 10:38AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Scott, the new version of Mortal Coil is up for pre-order on IPR, hopefully it'll rectify that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197408/#Comment_197408" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T10:44:51+00:00" title="March 17, 2009 10:44AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Ah, another light-passtime post.

I wasn't really happy with the magic in the base rulebook, and like most other TROS fans I was awaiting the "Sorcery and Fey" book which now seems highly unlikely to ever see the light of day.

I don't even consider buying a book unless I'm nearly positive that I'm going to use it these days (blame both the economy and getting older), so I don't have anything on the shelf right now that I haven't played or used yet.  And generally once I've decided I'm not going to use a book again, I just trade it in and use the credit for something else, so most of my "will never use again" books are already long gone.<br/><br/>Still, I know I have some hangers-on packed away in a closet, so I'll bust out a flashlight and a pith helmet and go exploring:<br/><br/>Okay, a bunch of AD&amp;D2e books, just as expected.  These are definitely in the "will never play again" category, and if I ever absolutely have to throw out books to make room for other things, they'll be the first ones on the heap.  Can't sell 'em, after all, even if they weren't all banged up from high school.  Although I still sort of like the Complete Thief's Handbook, so maybe that one would be spared.  There were a lot of neat ideas in it.<br/><br/>Looking deeper...oh, hey, Vampire: The Dark Ages.  Huh.  I remember that one, sort of.  We did a game of it long ago that turned out okay.<br/><br/>And what's this under it?  Jesus, I can't believe I actually have a copy of Werewolf 1st edition.  Was that the one that was thrown in as a freebie when I bought a bunch of other used books?  I don't think I've even <i>opened</i> it.  And given that it's the first edition Storyteller system, I can't imagine ever wanting to play it.  But it was free, it's likely unsellable, and...there's just something wrong with the idea of throwing away a book.  So it can stay for now, I guess.<br/><br/>Ooh, Planescape stuff!  Okay, I know I'm not going to play with these again, but...um...I think I'll put them up on the shelf for a little while anyway.  So pretty.  So much fun.  I can move some of those GURPS supplements I'm not going to be using into storage to make room for them.<br/><br/>Some mined-out Star Wars Adventure Journals (d6) back here, too; I'm pretty sure I stole all the best parts from them already, so unless our gaming group's roster changes completely, I'm not likely to be able to use them again.  I should probably put them in the "To Sell" bag out in the kitchen.

So, when I came back to the US from Japan back in 2000, and basically sold All My Shit, I had toooooons of AD&amp;D 1st edition and 2nd edition stuff. I think I owned every single "Complete" book, even the shitty ones (Elves): I loved the "Kits". In fact, I even went back and bought the PDF versions of Thief and Sha'ir, because they were too damn cool (especially Sha'ir: They really pushed the limits of the 2e system in that one).<br><br>But the last one I sold was Thieves'. In fact, I think it survived the first wave of culling but got caught in the second one. A lot of the thief equipment entries helped me formulate adventures around it. The "All Thief Campaign" suggestions drove me on to run all-thief games in D&amp;D 3e. In fact, the very scenario they set up in that chapter, of a middle-eastern world and cruel vizier who destroys the thieves' guild to maintain power (to which the thief PCs must now band together and strike back) was the foundation for at least two of my future game campaigns, including The Riddle of Steel. That idea is still one that I haven't tired of, and planning on running that situation again with a new system some day (TSOY?).<br><br>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197432/#Comment_197432" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-17T12:22:17+00:00" title="March 17, 2009 12:22PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been working on purging my games.

There was something really wonderful about playing in the world of Continuum, understanding the need to track your Span/Yet, and yet as players simply *not having to do it* so that you can focus on characters/the world. A thought, it you really want to play up the (imo "AWESOME") world of Continuum, but without having to keep a diary.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>Space Master (the 1980s version)</blockquote>\nOh, that game was awesome!

I'm not dissuaded from my intention to run a campaign later this year, but I was curious in your case if it was the Setting details, or was it Rules details that made the game incomprehensible to you?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite><b>Aberrant:</b>I want to love this, but can't do Storyteller.  Another "love setting, not-love system."</blockquote>\nHoly shit yeah. Aberrant is my favorite supers RPG, hands down, because of the setting. It really felt like it took supers in a new direction (with its focus on supers as wealthy media-giants, etc). The Terragen stuff was great, too: Presented in a way where I couldn't help but want to sympathize with them, even though most of their members were totally fucked in the head. Ran two campaigns of it, but I mean to go back sometime and run it again with another system.

The rules were... ambitious... in that they have neither skill nor stat analogues.  Instead you have these layered areas of expertise relevant to a given task which build up to a bonus to a basic "do stuff" roll.  The setting was wonderfully atmospheric too.  It was the last great Multisim game and I think it kind of encapsulates the French design ethos : "great setting, rules don't really matter".  I've gotten quite a bit of play out of French games with my current group; Malefices, Te Deum and a game based upon Ecryme but played with OTE rules as I couldn't find my copy of the core book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197553/#Comment_197553" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T07:27:55+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  7:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Complete Thief's Handbook was superb.

By contrast the Elves one was generic and dull and the one on Halflings and Gnomes was just rubbish.<br/><br/>The ADD2 historical campaign settings were also rather choice.  I have a copy of the Charlemagne one somewhere and I know that Balbinus has nothing but love for the one on Vikings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197556">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197556/#Comment_197556" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T08:05:20+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  8:05AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>BTW, one thing I tried was running Continuum with Primetime Adventures (it was basically a Whedonesque TV show about time travel, about 85% was inspired by Continuum, 15% by "Time Cop"), and it worked<i><b>like a motherfucking charm</b></i>. There was something really wonderful about playing in the world of Continuum, understanding the need to track your Span/Yet, and yet as players simply *not having to do it* so that you can focus on characters/the world. A thought, it you really want to play up the (imo "AWESOME") world of Continuum, but without having to keep a diary.</blockquote>\nYeah, I really wish you could just, uh, make a Spanbook check and, if you failed, accidentally frag yourself in some interesting way or have a "gemini incident" where you meet yourself.  That would streamline things a bunch.  I also feel like Continuum would work REALLY well as a Burning Something / Mouse Guard hack, because it already has scripted time combat, yeah?  I would love to roll Disposition for some narcs and then frag them across space-time.  Burning Anachrony, yes!  You could even cross it with Blossoms and play the time-traveling samurai tasked with protecting the Heian Era from meddling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197566/#Comment_197566" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T09:23:41+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  9:23AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite><b>Weapons of the Gods</b>: I heard good things about this, particularly on Sons of Kryos, but it's such a giant strange mess of a game I can't get my head around it.</blockquote>\nWhile I have nothing but love for everyone that worked on WotG, I found that character generation was problematic if everyone did not own their own copy of the game; and even then, you had to read about 250 pages of Possible Character Backgrounds to build a dude: Wish there were more on fast-builds of characters, etc.<br/>It's a game I definitely want to learn by having a master of the game run me a session or two, because I can't wade through the book fast enough to maintain interest through the valleys between the Huge Interesting Black Holes that appear here and there in the book.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite><b>Justifiers:</b>Why do I have this?

Unfortunately, I didn't see the appeal to any of the other supplements: It's a world which prides itself on "You don't need to know a setting, and there's no metaplot: Just point at an open space on the map and Start Playing!", yet the other supplements detailed in excruciating minutiae various canonical locations... I just never saw the appeal to those as opposed to the fatsplats.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197567/#Comment_197567" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T09:27:46+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  9:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, setting aside the fact that Exalted is a nightmare of crunch, the supplement treadmill did indeed stomp on a promissingly vague setting with the great clomping foot of nerdism.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197579/#Comment_197579" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T10:31:26+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 10:31AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite><b>Aberrant:</b>I want to love this, but can't do Storyteller.

So yeah sometimes we rolled dice for stuff, most of the time the players were talking and smoozing and being important. These days I would run that with something much more hippy and rules lite.<br/><br/>For Exalted I found if you viewed the Supplements as "Here are some examples of stuff (places, items, dudes, gods, ect) that you can use if you like or as inspiration for your own stuff" then they became much more useful. First Edition was much better for that I think, but there is some cool stuff in the 2nd Edition stuff though I gave up on that line a while ago.<br/><br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197597/#Comment_197597" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T11:31:17+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 11:31AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There was a time when I enjoyed Trinity (aka Aeon) quite a bit.

I can deal with every rule as-written, even the kind of Heavy Metal "Fuck Your Transhumanism, This is The Eighties!" setting: The only problem is that combat takes for Fucking Ever. Remember shooting 1d4 crossbow bolts into the hide of a 200+ hitpoint barbarian back in the AD&amp;D days? Yeah, that's what happens when you get into a firefight with any weapon which doesn't come with its own backpack, or is mounted on a vehicle.<br/><br/>But drop Stamina/Hit Points to one third, or dramatically increase the damage of weapons (or lethality: "Roll to shoot. Then take the difference between your roll and your skill, and add it to your damage." Something like that), and I think it actually still holds up ok.<br/><br/>Until you start getting into starship battles, which again are like firing crossbows at a barbarian, only *more boring*. And inertia exists in 0G, too. I don't require perfect space realism, but I do require more than "it's like Car Wars, but the map is all black".<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197791/#Comment_197791" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T09:40:20+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  9:40AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D 2nd Ed through 3.5 all sit in a tub under my bed, not likely to be played again.

Moving a year ago made me give away something like 15 boxes of RPGs that I wasn't ever going to use again. Of those I kept without intention of play in the near future: \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I still like Pendragon, and given the right group I'd quite like to unlimber my books and notes, but I find it unlikely that that will actually happen.</blockquote>\nI have every book from every edition of Pendragon ever published. And I haven't played any of them in at least 5 years. (I did a one shot a couple years ago, but one shots of Pendragon so don't count.) I doubt I'll play it in the near future either, but there is no chance I'm getting rid of any of them. <br/><br/>Prince Valiant I kept because, well, its fucking Prince Valiant dude. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hexabolic</cite><br/><b>Tribe 8:</b>Another awesome setting tied to a mediocre system.</blockquote>\nAgain, a game I own every single book for. (More than half of them were comps though.) Despite the fact that when I play again, which I will, I'll use like.. the 1st ed MRB and Vimary, and chuck the rest. Still, can't get rid of them because I wrote so many of them. <br/><br/>I also have whole piles of games that I'll never play as is, but that I use as reference manuals, sources of inspiration or art, background mines, and the like. 7th Sea, Talislanta, Ars Magica, Aberrant, Changeling, Everway, and a couple GURPS books all sit in this category.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197840">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197840/#Comment_197840" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T12:21:50+00:00" title="March 19, 2009 12:21PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread made me buy The Complete Thief and The Complete Bard last night, second-hand, on Amazon.<br/><br/>BASTARD STORY GAMES<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197882/#Comment_197882" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-19T15:49:38+00:00" title="March 19, 2009  3:49PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm probably never going to run the Burning Wheel.

I'm curious to hear about the ur-source of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197963/#Comment_197963" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T04:37:32+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  4:37AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Balbinus</cite>what's it like?

In the 2" box there were the rules, saddle stitched, a sheet of cardstock stand-ups to cut out with silhouettes of characters and monsters, character sheets, and dice.  That's what I remember.  As far as I know the rules have not changed much at all.  For 1981 the production values were amazing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197965">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197965/#Comment_197965" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T04:44:28+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  4:44AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds very similar to second, which I bought again on Ebay, I plan to sell my later editions as part of my clearout.

I'm sure you've heard that it works many times by now, but I see no harm in saying it again.  <br/><br/>Curiously, I recently read an Alan Furst novel called The Polish Officer, set in WW2.  At one point in that the eponymous officer as he is about to leave occupied Warsaw has to deal with a teenager who is staying behind to fight, in the sure knowledge that they will die doing so.

The things I still have that I got from their sale racks are piles of Last Unicorn Games' Star Trek run and an almost complete run for Alternity. I think the Alternity thing is just becoming some sort of self-destructive task to see if I can actually get all the supplements for $2 or less. I'd have to check, but I think I'm only a half a dozen away from doing so. I should just eBay the lot and be done with it. I occasionally pick up what seems to be an interesting GURPS book as well, but I believe that Robin Hood is the only thing that has managed to stay on my shelf and not completed the circle of going back to the store.<br/>\n<br/>\nEveryone's lists look so short, I'm too ashamed to go on with the rest of my gaming shelves...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8938/which-games-stay-unplayed-on-your-shelf" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8938/which-games-stay-unplayed-on-your-shelf" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8938/which-games-stay-unplayed-on-your-shelf/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8938%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8938%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
