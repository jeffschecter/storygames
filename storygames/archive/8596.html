Basically mostly relies on getting the other players to co-operate with the GM to reinforce the insanity.<br/><br/>For instance, if you develop amnesia you are sent out the room and the GM/remaining players invent something that has happened but your character doesn't remember. They then act like it happened without telling you. Works much better than being told to forget something IC, especialy since now you don't know which insanity you have.<br/><br/>It'd be easy to bolt onto an existing sanity system since it's all about how the effects are played, not how you get them.<br/><br/>John,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190521/#Comment_190521" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-29T08:13:41+00:00" title="January 29, 2009  8:13AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Insanity shouldn't make you weak. It should make you strong and free you.  How about this...<br/><br/>Your game has this claustrophobic feeling -- and I mean ruleswise. The rules need to be constraining. They prevent you from doing all kinds of shit. Or at least don't give you the tools to get stuff done.<br/><br/>As you become more and more insane, those constraints start to disappear. You earn traits like "Doesn't care what other people think" and "Makes strange connections between things." Even typical insanity traits like "Multiple personalities" and "Arachnophobia" should offer new avenues for play where traditional games constrain you. Really, if you earn a new trait (with currency or something) every time you slip deeper into nuttiness, then you get more powerful gamewise.

Here goes:<br/><br/>* You make a sanity check whenever you see something violent, horrible and scary. Straight up UA.<br/>* I'm not set on that yet, but you either roll your Mind stat or your current amount of failed notches. So the more insane you get, the harder it is to go MORE insane.<br/>* Another thing I'm not clear yet. I don't want to use Psychology and Psychiatry, so I'll probably let them gain back their sanity by ''saving the day'' at the end of a story or by indulging some kind of vice (like drinking or sex).<br/>*Dark Days is a horror game about people with extraordinary and scary powers that deal with other extraordinary creatures with even worse powers. The game is about remaining human enough to do the job and not go insane or go off the other end and become a monster.<br/><br/>Hope that covers it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190713/#Comment_190713" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-30T22:12:24+00:00" title="January 30, 2009 10:12PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe you can take a <i>CoC</i>-type sanity mechanic and tie it back into your game's goals.  For example: One thing I played around with during my heavy <i>Call of Cthulhu</i> period was tying SAN loss to some sort of magical power gain.  Inspired by the existing mechanic that tied together tome-reading, spell learning, and SAN losing, I playtested giving characters 1MP per lost SAN. So for a three-session adventure, I handed out useful spells, provided serious supernatural adversity, and we had a blast with the tight death spiral of easy SAN loss into more magic into easier SAN loss.   It was distilled Cthulhu, a little too intense for everyweek play but a fun changeup from the usual tone (and survivability!) of the floating campaign I was running.<br/><br/>Depending on how hard you want to keep "remaining human enough" in your own game, you might enjoy playing around with something similar.  Mechanics with feedback, even with death spirals, definitely have a place, especially in horror games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bifi" title="Bifi"><img alt="Bifi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bifi">Bifi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190727/#Comment_190727" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-31T08:55:03+00:00" title="January 31, 2009  8:55AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about "pay SAN to witness something horrible"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_190731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190731/#Comment_190731" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-31T09:35:47+00:00" title="January 31, 2009  9:35AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            More grist: why not focus on precisely how a lower Sanity separates the protagonists from the world at large?  For each notch, you could write a sentence about why the character accumulated it, and treat that as a kind of trait (details depending on your system).  So for instance, suppose a character fails a Sanity check after seeing some kind of squamous, serpentine Thing from Beyond slither forth from the shadows to swallow a man whole.  Her experience could be summed up as simply as "There are squamous, serpentine Things from Beyond in the shadows."  The knowledge becomes a trait, giving her a generous bonus on further checks, especially Sanity checks, where the knowledge applies.  But it also means that she's at a penalty when she's trying to intimidate a witness in a shadowy alley (Was that a flash of scales?  She keeps frantically looking away from the witness, her face twitches.), or ritually bind a malefic spirit in the Reptiles exhibit at the zoo, surely the Most Squamous Place on Earth.  <br/><br/>And the GM will drive the characters toward conflict, right?  So at some point, she will need to have a climactic battle in an urban canyon, lit by low-angled light from the almost completely set sun.  If she wins that battle, maybe she can buy back that "shadows" Sanity notch.  Failing that, she might find solace in benzodiazepines, which allow her to ignore the notch for as long as her supply holds out...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_190732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/190732/#Comment_190732" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-31T09:44:24+00:00" title="January 31, 2009  9:44AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey ccreitz<br/><br/>That definitely fits my game.

There are a few in it when the game starts, and the GM must put new ones in it each time he reveals some part of the mythic situation.<br/>\n<br/>\nd4 represent dreams and nightmares<br/>\nd8 represent hallucinations<br/>\nd12 represent unspeakable tomes of inhuman knowledge and other related devices<br/>\nd20 represent an invocation to what is best left undescribed<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a player, you can take a die from the bowl and narrate a mini-scene that goes with the die's symbolic. But this costs you Sanity. If the GM wishes, he can propose you a pact, where he takes over the narration, but you pay less San.<br/>\n<br/>\nSee the idea? The more colour you add to the shared imagined fiction, the more effective your character becomes and the more likely he will meet a lovecraft-appropriate ending. 0 San means your character becomes an NPC. But you can suicide your character before that and still use the remaining Sanity score to buy scenes to colour in the events.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the more you dabble in the forbidden arts and non-euclidean geometry, the more you succeed, which is good, because when you fail, your name goes on a list which the GM keeps. He can cross off your name to put your character in bad situations HE chooses, not you. But the GM can also throw in his own horrendous scenes (that's also when he must add dice to the bowl which resides between the spaces), which cause sanity loss according to some alien algorithm. So you can never quite know if it's safe to increase your character's effectiveness or not.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe dice you pick up? You give them to the other players whenever you feel like it. A lot of people like giving dice when somebody takes up their previously introduced ideas about the Mythos, so you can get some lasting memes going on. A player may roll a number of gifted dice to attempt success at a task roll or sanity roll (either add or subtract as appropriate).<br/>\n<br/>\nAn most important bit: a given Sanity score doesn't dictate how you have to play your character (that idea is right out of <i>Sorcerer</i> and Humanity). The fiction should be rich enough that any player may be trusted to play his character's madness in an appropriate way. Some stay seemingly sane a long time and suddenly snap, some become progressively weirder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis works quite well in my experience. I still need to polish up some numbers and a technique or two, but the basics are here. Feel free to plunder.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_191749">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191749/#Comment_191749" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-09T19:41:31+00:00" title="February  9, 2009  7:41PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So after reading Hot War (which is excellent btw), I've been thinking of adding Relationships to the Sanity mechanics. It make sense that people you love or hate could help you remain sane. I'll expand on it to include objects and hobbies, or passions. The problem is, I want to find a way for the characters to ''sacrifice'' these things when a Sanity check comes up. But I don't see how it would work, logically. Mechanically, it's easy. You lose the conflict, you lose the relationship.<br><br>I've been playing around with the idea for a while, along with the idea of using madness as Aspects, but that too, is tough.<br><br>Any suggestions? My goal is to make the Sanity mechanic something more than 1s and 0s.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_191841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/191841/#Comment_191841" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-10T08:44:49+00:00" title="February 10, 2009  8:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Borrow heavily from FATE/SotC compels.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197207/#Comment_197207" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T12:09:16+00:00" title="March 16, 2009 12:09PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you've not read it already, I strongly suggest taking a look at 'Don't Rest Your Head'.

To NOT kill somebody when you don't want to, roll over "KILL".<br>\nYou choose how many dice to roll. If you roll twice the stat, raise it by 1. If you roll half the stat, reduce by 1.<br>\nAnother stat could be "Getting away". Roll under to get away, roll over to stand and fight when it counts. "Magic": roll under to fry the evil henchmen with magic fire, roll over to overcome the horrible temptation to just get her love through wizardry. "Nobility": roll under to rule the easily impressed, roll over to care for the dirty and poor. "Smarts": roll under to see the details, roll over to not miss the big picture.
