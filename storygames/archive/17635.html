Had a blast. Some questions:<br/><br/>1) The rules are pretty clear about "table talk" in some areas (like the Hold a Discussion action), but I wasn't as sure about other times. I know it's not really in the spirit of the rules to guide other players' decisions, but can clarifying questions be asked when other players resolve a card, describe a project's completion, Discover Something New or Start a Project? (Examples might be: How many wolves are in the pack?, How does the camp find out about this new discovery?, How is that project being done?, etc.) Or if I am unclear on part of someone else's contribution, is it up to me to create the answers?<br/><br/>1a) When the players collectively decide how long a new project will take to complete, how much table talk is allowed? Do we just suggest time lengths, or can we say why we make those suggestions?<br/><br/>2) I know that resources can go from Abundant to Scarce and vice versa, but can they just leave both lists? We had a few things that started Scarce but grew in number... but never to the point of Abundance. <br/><br/>3) Should the assumption always be that anything a player introduces to the story is considered to be "known" by the camp at large? I ask this because one of my clarifying questions a few times was "Cool, does anyone else in the camp know that?"<br/><br/>4) Is it ever OK to have the characters talk about the Frost Shepards before game end? Or is that knowledge only for the players, not the characters?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399501/#Comment_399501" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-03T19:08:14+00:00" title="December  3, 2012  7:08PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Yes, totally, you can (and should) ask for clarification or elaboration -- but, as you say, be careful not to use this as a means of objecting-to or otherwise manipulating the contributions of the other players. Still, your ability to build off what others have said is dependent on your having a clear understanding -- so don't hesitate to ask, if something is unclear. (If you find that you are constantly asking questions and nobody else is doing so, this might be a problem with group expectations re: level of detail.)<br/><br/>1a. In my experience this usually includes discussion of reasons, and often connects to question 1: sometimes the length of the project might depend on details that haven't been made super-clear. (I often find myself asking questions to clarify how <i>thoroughly</i> the community is doing something, for example, which can easily make a 2-week project into a month-long one.)<br/><br/>2. Yes.<br/><br/>3. I would say so, yes -- unless it has been established previously that there are a lot of secretive factions, or something. But it does seem like some groups/players like to include a LOT of named community members and then specifically narrate them doing/finding stuff, so that could change things.<br/><br/>4. Depends on the group/setting, I'd say. I haven't seen it happen in the games I've played. Sometimes, as a player, I have thought to myself 'I wonder if So-and-so Group might be the Frost Shepherds', but usually that's something I consider only in retrospect, if at all. I think of the Shepherds as an inevitable force of nature, a stand-in for any number of things that are completely beyond the control of the community. It follows, for me, that they are also beyond the ken of the community: the community perceives only the immediate threats, the problems they can deal with. <br/><br/>The Frost Shepherds are a repudiation of the belief that solving problems and planning ahead will be enough. To me this is best understood as a form of dramatic irony: we as players understand that <i>nothing will be enough</i>, but the community doesn't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399519/#Comment_399519" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T02:55:38+00:00" title="December  4, 2012  2:55AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            IceCreamEmperor nailed all those answers. To add some:<br/><br/>1.) Feel free to ask for clarification on Discovering Something New, Starting a Project, or resolving a card. Don't ask for a scene's worth of details, but definitely ask questions where necessary. "Where do they get the wood from?" "wait, so are these individual houses, or a divided longhouse?"<br/><br/>2.) Typically, when a Scarcity gets resolved, it should just be removed. It's rare to go directly from Scarcity to Abundance all at once. (the same is true for Abundances into Scarcities.)<br/><br/>3.) Yes. Things that are discovered are discovered by the community. Avoid character narratives that trump community narratives. But like all communities, yours will be a busy one, and it's unlikely that everyone hears everything. That might factor into your fiction in some way. (*emphatic hand-wave*)<br/><br/>4.) Daniel's answer is really good. Often, there's an awesome moment in Winter where you suddenly realize that X might be the frost shepherds. You lose that magic by defining them in advance. There's no rule saying you can't talk about what the Frost Shepherds are in advance, but do tread lightly, and recognize the magical quality that emerges when you leave them unknown.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399745/#Comment_399745" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-05T19:07:32+00:00" title="December  5, 2012  7:07PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the answers, guys!

You can play it with five and the game won't break, but 2-4 is the sweet spot where the game delivers reliably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_400055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jda1974" title="jda1974"><img alt="jda1974" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jda1974">jda1974</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/400055/#Comment_400055" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-07T20:19:29+00:00" title="December  7, 2012  8:19PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks.
