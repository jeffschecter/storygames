The world we came up with ended up with a few parallels to The Matrix and Equilibrium, but with plenty of aspects of our own that infused it with all sorts of possibilities.  Overall, we probably spent half of the session with setup and the other half with playing our protagonists.  Since we had 5 of those, we didn't get to play many scenes for each, but surprisingly we managed to resolve one story goal and get close to a couple of others.<br/><br/>I have a bunch of things to say about the game, both about Shock and our playtime in particular, but I need to let that stew for a while before I write that out.  In the meantime, let it be known that 1.1 was very clear in most aspects, and the rules led to a good session that we all seemed eager to continue next time.<br/><br/>I wrote up one scene (and a half) in a <a href="http://chgriffen.livejournal.com/148439.html" rel="nofollow">fictionalized version on my livejournal</a>, along with my protagonist data.  Fictionalized just means I added a lot of details and wrote it like a fiction scene; the conflicts, minutiae and events were the ones that came out in the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90560/#Comment_90560" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T21:38:29+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  9:38PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really enjoyed this game, and I hope the 5 of us can get together soon and continue this story.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterestingly, even though the parallels with the Matrix and Equilibrium are obvious, I didn't really feel very influenced by either of those stories. rather, I felt that we had something much closer to Oshi's Avalon in some respects, with bits of Bladerunner and Ghost in the Shell thrown in for fun.

I just wasn't thinking about it at the time. I think it went fine though. Given more time, I think we could have explored the idea that Nix really didn't believe in the real world. We could have had Father slowly lead Nix to that conclusion, until s/he was forced into that realization. But we just didn't have that kind of time. As it stands now, Nix knows there is something fundamentally wrong with his/her world and that someone is trying to show him/her what that is. I still don't think s/he's ready to really believe that the virtual world where s/he has lived her entire life is fake and this pathetic meat world of fixed bodies, static data, verbal communication and sensation based on physical stimuli ("you want to have sex?

I think that made a big difference.

My character's primary antagonists were the outcasts, but he's heading toward a confrontation with his handler and the church.

But have you thought about and/or experimented with having the antagonists be usable by different protagonists in various scenes?

First, Joshua, great game! I especially love the way it structures a means of setting up play to address the kinds of themes you want in your story.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: xenopulse</cite>The world we came up with ended up with a few parallels to The Matrix and Equilibrium, but with plenty of aspects of our own that infused it with all sorts of possibilities.</blockquote>\nYeah, it's funny, it wasn't until I was trying to describe the game for someone else that I realized, "Y'know, this sounds like we're cribbing from the Matrix. . ." Believe it or not, the thought never entered my mind during setup or play. Hell, our setup session started with the idea of <i>Galactus</i> as a shock, and evolved from there. Our thought process was something along the lines of, "What if there's an imminent destruction of society/the world coming, which cannot be stopped?" From there we went to "OK, so the world's technology is slowly failing, and people have to cope with that in the face of total dependence on that tech." And then it was just a short hop to "Total dependence? OK, so how about everyone's wired into the virtual world, increasingly leaving their bodies behind, and only savages and outcasts spend their lives in harsh reality?" Mix in a little theocracy (the Church that preaches abandonment of Sinful Flesh and excommunicates by jacking you out, for whom Christian was an Enforcer), and we were good!<br/><br/>Jake, ditto on the Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell (I haven't seen Avalon), plus I wasx drawing a bit on the Void Captain's Tale for my portrayal of a decadent and conflicted Cyberistocrat.<br/><br/>Also, I too found the text to be quite clear, aside from a couple of fiddly questions that Joshua cleared up for me over on the Forge. 'Course, I haven't seen the original, so I have nothing to compare it to.<br/><br/>Christian, on the Antagonist-changing, I would probably (as Joshua alludes to) wait until <i>after</i> your Story-goal conflict resolves, and take (if appropriate from the results, which it probably will be) the new Antag then. It still makes sense to have the outcasts as your Antag <i>during</i> the final conflict, just like it made sense leading up <i>to</i> it. After all, they're the ones causing the inner conflict between your conscience and the Church's directives! When you've good and made an enemy of the Church, then's a fine time procedurally change it over.<br/><br/>Naturally, there's probably a good bit of personal preference in the above, especially as I'm playing your Antagonist. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>All that aside, I thought I'd relate one of my favorite bits from the game, a dialogue exchange between Jake's protag Nix, who believes the virtual world is all that exists, and Annie's protag Annie (chosen for her own ease), a programming tech who's currently jacked out:<br/><br/><b>Nix:</b> [s/he changes avatars on impulse, and her current icon is a 2-D videogame image of two cowboys riding a snake] Hello, I was wondering if you could give me some info on this game map I was just playing, it says you helped design it.<br/><b>Annie:</b> Sure, what did you want to know?<br/><b>Nix:</b> Well, I--hey, you're not showing an avatar. You having some technical difficulty?<br/><b>Annie:</b> No, I'm just logged out of the system right now.<br/><b>Nix:</b> Logged out of the--but where are y--well, whatever, can you tell me [specific info about the map]?<br/><b>Annie:</b> No problem, I've got that info right here.<br/><b>Nix:</b> OK, great, stay there, I'll be right over to get it.<br/><b>Annie:</b> Come here? To my location? But how will you get here?<br/><b>Nix:</b> [Distracted, boggled at the question] Huh? I'll just take the snake. . .listen, never mind, just go ahead and mail it to me.<br/><br/>Probably the best "two characters are completely misunderstanding each other's frame of reference and the players both know why" conversation I've ever seen in an RPG. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Run by the church. It's holy. And then there's the physical world, which is unholy and filthy. That includes any kind of real physical contact.<br/><br/>Some people get kicked out of the Ideal--i.e., they get Excommunicated. If you've lived all your life in a virtual world where you can be anyone and anything, dealing with the limitations of the physical world can drive you mad. Who are you? What's right and wrong? Which emotions are real? What are you supposed to do?<br/><br/>So there are some crazies out there. Cannibals that live in the sewers. They couldn't handle the transition.<br/><br/>One of our protagonists, Joel's to be precise, recently left the Ideal and is being chased by the authorities now. He's naked, starving, and afraid. And he <i>can't change it instantaneously</i>! That's horrifying. So he comes across these strange-looking teens that are roasting something over a campfire, and they invite him to eat. And now we've got a conflict: their intent is to make him eat human flesh. His intent is to find hope. They both win: our protagonist realizes too late what he's eating, and in return the teens tell him about Lazarus, another protagonist who's gathering outcasts to lead them to the promised land.<br/><br/>See, it all makes sense <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_97392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

He's interrogating him on the whereabouts of a special chip the Church thinks Laz has, but Laz doesn't know what they're talking about. Anastasius doesn't believe him, and keeps applying the pressure, even shooting his own partner (who'd been showing Lazarus a Way Out that he could lead the exiles to) to show he means business. But Lazarus can't divulge what he doesn't know. So then I break in as Drex, Anastasius' handler. "Has the prisoner talked yet?"<br/>"No, he's proving difficult, even under drugs. I think we'll need more time to crack this one."<br/>"We don't have time, Agent Anastasius. We're counting on you to resolve this swiftly. You know what to do. Use some leverage."<br/>"I don't know what I could possibly use that's of value to him, Sir."<br/>"Do I have to spell it out for you, Agent? What about those Outcasts he's so fond of?"<br/>"Sir, I hardly think. . ."<br/>"Agent! Request immediate inventory of your ammunition!"<br/>"Uh, I have four clips remaining; 120 rounds total."<br/>"Excellent, more than enough. I'll expect you to have this matter settled by the end of the first clip. Drax out." And the interrogation room door opens as several outcast children are ushered in. . .<br/><br/>Bottom line, Anastasius wouldn't do it, Drax ordered the door guards to fire instead, children go down, Anastasius takes out the guards, frees Lazarus, and flees with the other Outcasts captives from outside, resolving his story goal "Become Emancipated from the Church."

He's been feeling guilty all along that he beat that kid up. He found out in the meantime, because of his previous scene, that many of the outcasts were excommunicated through no fault of their own, and that the Church is expelling them for some other reason. And so it really did all lead up to this, because if he had been on drugs and less unsure about the Church, he probably would have followed orders.<br/><br/>In system terms, the conflict was this:<br/><br/>Anastasius wanted to save the kids. The outcasts (my Antagonist group) wanted me to join their ranks.<br/><br/>We figured out that, if both fail, I'm going to blame Lazarus for the whole deal and become a total rogue agent against everyone. But as the dice fall, they succeed in their intent and I fail. That's why we end up busting out together (and commandeer the troop transport gunship that had played a pivotal role in capturing Lazarus just before).<br/><br/>Now, Annie's minutiae die could have changed that... but after some discussion, she goes, "I'm sorry, but it just makes for a better tragic story if they die."

It seems to me that we ended up with a lot of conflicts where one outcome was preferred, either unanimously or by a great majority, around the table. Like the killing of kids in Christian's scene. So there wasn't really a lot of competition over outcomes--the Antags of course had to direct their dice maximally against their opponents, but the protags don't need to do that, and I even remember using my D4 in <i>favor </i>of Annie's Antag goal of "Make Dox eat human flesh" because I just couldn't imagine the scene without it.<br/><br/>Now, I'm perfectly happy with the conflict outcomes and resulting story, but a bit disappointed that there wasn't more opportunity to engage the mechanics more, e.g. by risking links to reroll a failure. Rather, we proceeded with a fair degree of consensus on when it was best for Protags to succeed or fail, so that A) when success was preferred, there wasn't any need to risk Links what with everyone pulling for/halfheartedly opposing you, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> when failure was preferred, there was no <i>desire</i> to risk Links and ruin a perfectly good tragedy. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> Which is all the more frustrating when I realize that I <i>did</i> have a great opportunity in the first session to risk a link to contest an outcome (Dox Proteum's ejection from the virtual; he was still trying to change the system from within), but was too green in the system to remember I could do that. So I arrived the second time all charged and ready to risk left and right, and no opportunity emerged. :P<br/><br/>I dunno how big an issue this is; after all, I certainly had loads of fun with the game. It just detracted from the emotional charge of conflicts somewhat. I've also noticed this in the one game of PTA I've played, which I know Shock: owes a lot to, mechanically. Perhaps this sort of mechanical design leads to such things? Particularly the level of resolution granularity? Like, in a more action-to-action scene, your opposition can push, push push at every step of the way and still allow you the opportunity to overcome the adversity and achieve your desired outcome. It's easier as antagonist to keep fighting even if you prefer the protagonist to win, since you can really hamper them at one round (or what have you) without destroying their ability to rebound and triumph. But when it's all down to one roll for the scene, there's not much leeway if you want to lose. You either do, or you don't, right <i>NOW.</i><br/><br/>Does that make sense? Another factor I noticed was that a lot of our resolutions had a "Yes, but. . ." quality. "You discover the hope of an Exodus. . .but you're tricked into eating people." "You escape from the Church and ally with the resistance. . .but a bunch a kids get gunned down." And so forth. Which at least tells you where our group preference lies, but I think the above musing steps behind that and points to the systemic factors that caused that preference to be enacted with less than fierce competition.<br/><br/>I dunno, Joshua or anyone else, what do you think?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_98438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98438/#Comment_98438" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T12:22:53+00:00" title="September 23, 2007 12:22PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe this is an indicator that we aren't making our intents strong enough (see p. 41 sidebar).  To quote:  "...strong [intents] require a response on the part of the Protagonist.  They're unequivocal.  The Protagonist player will care about these things and will have to make choices between what zie wants and stopping the Antagonist from gaining hir Intent."<br/><br/>Now, certainly, killing the kids is a strong intent; Anastasius definitely didn't want that to happen and it definitely evoked a response from Anastasius. But to look at Vox's conflict with the cannibals...<br/><br/>Vox's Intent was "I want to find some hope."  [i.e. learn about Lazarus' exodus plan].  The Antag's Intent was "Vox will eat human flesh."  Both succeeded.  Are these Intents strong enough? (Maybe they are).  <br/><br/>"I want to find some hope" - what kind of response did this evoke in Vox?  As I recall, it propelled Vox to seek out Lazarus - and thus closer to Vox's story goal.  I'd say that that was a strong Intent.<br/><br/>"Vox will eat human flesh." - on it's face, this seems to be a strong intent if for no other reason than it's shocking.  However, I don't think it provoked much of a response from Vox.  It neither propelled Vox toward nor deterred him from his story goal.  Thus, there is little incentive on behalf of Vox to vehemently oppose this outcome.  A stronger Intent would be "Vox becomes a cannibal" - this would <span style="text-decoration: underline;">definitely</span> require a response from Vox/Joel as the story moves forward - and, from a Protag point of view, Joel would have a lot of incentive to prevent this outcome.<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Our method was more just talking about the whole thing in general until we had two intents settled, whatever order they came up in. I think looking at Antag intent as a <i>reaction</i> (and escalation) to the Protag intent should lead to stronger and more intense games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

It's the perfect cap on Dox's descent: Decadent, intellectual VR dandy stripped of his pride, his comfort, his resources, practically his very personhood, and now he has to eat someone's Grandma to survive. Excellent! Couldn't see it any other way.<br/><br/>I think David's countersuggestion, does Dox <i>become</i> a cannibal, would have been much stronger, and something I'd have fought to avoid. Then we could take the people-eating as given, and look to how the eating <i>affects</i> him.

I'm ashamed to admit that I can't even <i>remember</i> at present what Anastasius' links <i>were</i>. (The Church? His Handler? Hmm. . .) Annie did a good job of utilizing my Links at first, but once Dox was ejected from the virtual world, it was hard to bring his Links (whom he only had access to in te virtual) into direct play.

Dox doesn't want to become a cannibal, so he risks his link to Lara in order to re-try the conflict in hopes that the Antag will fail.)<br/><br/>Is there a mechanism for the Antag to force the Links into danger?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98513/#Comment_98513" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-23T23:36:04+00:00" title="September 23, 2007 11:36PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I believe he Antag threatens Links in a very straightforward way: by involving them in scenes with the Protag, then pushing for conflict. Like Annie did with Dox in Laara in the first scene we played. Yeah, I framed the scene, but Annie picked up the ball and went all adversarial with it: Dox letting slip some pretty unorthodox attitudes and Laara thinnking he's bonkers and referring him to a shrink, when Dox wants to win her over to a new way of thinking. You can also threaten a Link more directly, like with physical peril. Risking Links on the Protag's part is simply over and above whatever the Antag is already doing with narration and stake-setting.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
