I find it a bit annoying due to how it encourages "epub readers" that are basically dumbed-down html readers that work less well than a modern web browser. It's also not particularly configurable from client nor publisher end, and the epub files that I encounter seem to be made cheaply and without understanding neither XHTML nor the limitations of the reader devices, resulting in files that don't use even what little features might be possible for the standard. The fundamental problem in adopting epub for serious publication work is that no matter how you slice it, it's not going to be or do anything that a solid implementation of XHTML wouldn't do; is it really worthwhile to focus resources and attention on it when we could be developing browser (html reader, that is) software for the same hardware?<br/><br/>The one big, fat advantage epub has in comparison to unrestrained XHTML is in enforcing book-creation discipline: tables of contents, indexes, cover pages and such will all be created to minimal standards - at least rigorously enough that the reading device will usually be able to know which page to display when the reader asks for a ToC, for example, which would not be possible in completely arbitrary XHTML. This discipline comes with limitations as well, of course, for every assumption that the standard makes to force you to actually make compatible and functional files is one limiting assumption more if you want to do something different. Definitely a plus point, and the actual purpose for the whole epub idea, at least if you discount the theory that epub had to be created so reader-device manufacturers could be saved the development costs of creating a real html viewer.<br/><br/>Setting the above comparison of html to epub aside, epub is obviously superior to PDF as a screen-reading format due to the strengths of digital typography, at least as long as your reading device knows how to do all the important bits: fonts and text size can be arbitrarily changed, lines reflow automatically, and the device can modify most of the typography effortlessly as long as the file has been created rigorously with correct CSS. PDF still wins out in my experience when it comes to anything but text: tables, illustrations, any but the most rudimentary layout - HTML could do this stuff, but at least my Sony Reader seems to be absolutely hopeless with even the simplest embedded images; I'm fond of saying that an addled middleschooler would write up better image-handling than the stuff Sony's chosen to put into the Reader's epub software, which is just another example of how the epub thing encourages lazy browser design.<br/><br/>I should note that my misgivings with the epub are theoretical in nature and more related to my general interest in web programming technologies than substantial issues. In practice I'm pretty interested in epub and am, indeed, considering it as an alternative to pdf in game writing. I probably should see if other common epub-reader softwares are such jokes when it comes to tables and images as Sony's is, but then not all game texts need much in the way of tables, so it's definitely an option. PDF is misapplied technology in the first place as screen-reading tech, so I wouldn't mind replacing it where I can. Who knows, perhaps increased use of epub would encourage creation of actually competent epub browsers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316157/#Comment_316157" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T11:59:37+00:00" title="March 10, 2011 11:59AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's got a good summation there. There are many very bad things about the PDF format for reference material like RPGs, but most RPG e-publishers don't even seem to realize that PDF can do good things for their work (a link to your website! linking a piece of jargon to a glossary! form-fillable character sheets and name cards!) and more or less treat e-publishing as a way to get a print book to someone without actually paying to print it.  <br/><br/>I think we're nowhere near the point where epub and PDF will produce dramatically different results.

You don't get control over margins and background gradients, and complicated sidebars but as a consumer actually trying to <em>use</em> your book for play, I just don't care anyway. I want the book readable and usable for me.</p>\n<p>My own feeling is that if you're producing a PDF for your book anyway, go ahead and export an ePub version with reduced/eliminated art assets and bundle it with the PDF (or, better yet, hardcopy+PDF/ePub) and accept that I may love the PDF for its pretty, but I'll <em>use</em> the ePub for its functionality. While you're at it, since you have to anyway, put in some decently detailed Table of Contents and maybe a couple indices that are actually worth something. Your PDF and print versions will be the better for it.</p>\n<p>(I haven't actually seen anyone produce a decent ePub RPG, but of the recent releases, <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/category/microscope/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Microscope</strong></a>, with its sparse layout and nice narrative flow for reference, would appear to be an excellent choice to give it a go as an offering.

I think my larger issue as someone picking up print design is that all those images and fancy layout shouldn't just be there to look nice, they should be there to function (and look nice). Just saying "okay, here's my flow of text, paginate it and lay it out however you please" is kind of a substandard way of reading the text. It's good for some types of referencing and for scaling to radically different screen sizes, but it doesn't allow me, the designer, to give you a text that I'm happy with. But also being a digital developer, I'd love to produce something that can scale to different screens.<br><br>Especially with my design process, which uses plaintext synced to layout, I can provide an ePub at next-to no cost, so I may do it, since obviously people want it. It just seems like a shame to take all the hard work that went into the design and lose it. That design wasn't just adding pretty pictures, it was making a functional visual presentation of the text.<br><br>That said, PDF's not great either. At this point I think I'm most excited by <a href="http://treesaver.net/portfolio/" rel="nofollow">treesaver</a>, which allows me to design for different sizes and have the text reflow based on the screen size. That way I get to actual design the book, instead of just giving out a flow of text and images, but that design takes account differing screen sizes. Even better, it has the possibility of allowing real interaction to be coded in as well.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316200/#Comment_316200" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T15:23:41+00:00" title="March 10, 2011  3:23PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Seth Drebitko</cite>So it seems that a huge draw back to the whole epub end of things is not in the epub files themselves but the various viewers used for them.<br><br>Edit: Does anyone have an example of an rpg in epub format that they would consider expetionally well set up?</br></br></blockquote>\nI can't think of any in ePub format that are well set up, but I'd imagine that Donjon would be easy to do, and A Dirty World would work reasonably well too.

A well-made PDF, with built in links, should be able to do a table of contents/index just as well as an ePub. PDF is better for "oh yeah, I remember reading that, I think it was on the right hand page, under one of those headers, near the picture of an orc."<br/><br/>Personally, I find the type of references I do the most ("I think it was somewhere around the orc picture" and table of contents) are actually better in PDF, but that's my preference. Doing a pure text search is, generally, faster in an ePub, but something I rarely find myself doing.<br/><br/>Referencing is not the same as searching, and a good layout helps referencing. I'm not saying that there aren't upsides to raw text, there certainly are, and my workflow shows that. But a well designed text aids referencing dramatically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316217/#Comment_316217" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T17:34:49+00:00" title="March 10, 2011  5:34PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2011 5:35PM by Ben_Robbins.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SquidLord</cite>I haven't actually seen anyone produce a decent ePub RPG, but of the recent releases,<a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/category/microscope/" rel="nofollow"><strong>Microscope</strong></a>, with its sparse layout and nice narrative flow for reference, would appear to be an excellent choice to give it a go as an offering.</blockquote>\nIt's hard to separate the medium from the message.

Facing page layouts always start with page one on the left, completely screwing up any of the authorial intent when it comes to facing juxtaposition.<br/><br/>The book was still awesome.<br/><br/>In a real sense, the truth is that most RPG books are overdesigned with the cute little fiddly bits, at best, aesthetic and at worst, distracting. That's compounded by the fact that a lot of RPG designers right now are graphic artists. That makes it that much harder to get away from the idea that all the little glittery pieces are necessary to understanding, or even all that helpful.<br/><br/>Does the composition of the page and the style of art make a difference to the presentation of a game like Happy Birthday, Robot!? Absolutely. Is it necessary to convey the content after the presentation has done its job? I would contend that it does not. The text alone stands, in and of itself, as a sufficient descriptor of the game. (And well it should! It is, after all, a book!)<br/><br/>Off the top of my head a list of games which, upon conversion to simple RTF, would lose none of their inherent power include: Microscope, Donjon, :Shock, Beast Hunters and MSG(tm). Any of those could be re-laid out with old-school wargame-style numbered headers and would be just as compelling in terms of content and more easily referenced by people familiar with the order of content.<br/><br/>Now to be clear I'm not saying that RPGs should no longer be laid out with PDFs and distributed as PDFs because composition and layout don't matter. I am definitely not saying that. I am saying that if there is an interest among RPG producers in targeting mobile devices \u2013 and there should be \u2013 then the creation of ePubs should be something they're interested in and actively pursuing in order to expand the borders of their market.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_316361">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/renatoram" title="renatoram"><img alt="renatoram" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/807/nGBBCZSYUQ7T4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/renatoram">renatoram</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316361/#Comment_316361" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-12T02:33:37+00:00" title="March 12, 2011  2:33AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2011 2:33AM by renatoram.">edited March 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: SquidLord</cite>And yet, ironically, the first time that I read Microscope, I used Adobe Reader \u2013 which always blows the presentation of facing pages because I never starts on the right-hand side.
