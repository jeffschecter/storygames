                    So over in <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=873" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> we were talking about dominoes as a resolution mechanism. Here are some thoughts.<br/><br/>You have dominoes face-down on the table in front of you. You and your opponent each pick one up, by one end, point them at each other and flip them over to reveal the pips.<br/><br/>The end you are holding is your <b>inner court</b>. The other end of your domino is your <b>outer court</b>. Your opponent's inner court is your <b>far court</b> and your opponent's outer court is your <b>side court</b>.<br/><br/>Compare your inner court with:<br/><br/>1. Your outer court. This is your Active move.<br/>2. Your side court. This is your Reactive move.<br/>3. Your far court. This is your Interactive move.<br/><br/>There could be other comparisons, of course.<br/><br/>The comparison could take (at least) three forms:<br/><br/>1. Win/lose/draw. (Are the inner court pips more, fewer, or equal in number to the court it is being compared with?)<br/>2. Margin of victory/defeat.<br/>3. Total pips (this isn't actually a comparison, it's adding the two courts together). You could take these as a positive number, or you could take it as positive if the inner court is higher or equal, negative if it is lower. <br/><br/>I suppose you could also multiply the courts, but this gives a really odd sequence. If you take blanks as 0, a quarter of the results (in a 28-domino, Western double-six set) come out as zero. If you take them as 7, the sequence runs: 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 21, 24, 25, 28, 30, 35, 36, 42, 49. If anyone can think of a use for that - well, I'll be very impressed.<br/><br/>And that's one of my two questions: How could you use this kind of resolution mechanism? <br/><br/>The other question is, What possibilities have I missed?                </div>

                            Mike,<br/><br/>I've always wanted a dominoes resolution mechanism.<br/><br/>Personally, I think that what you're missing is the idea of <i>connecting</i> dominoes. Imagine if you used your system, but there were also dominoes on the table. Then, when you flipped the domino, any side which connected to the dominoes presently on the table would be the inner court and the other side is the outer court.<br/><br/>And...off the top of my head...the system works on a direct win/lose/draw comparison. If you win the inner court, you win the contest; but if you win the outer court, you get to narrate the outcome of the contest (with the proviso that the winner of the inner court wins). On a draw, you draw the contest (inner court) or share the narration (outer court). Something like that.<br/><br/>(Edit: I realise I've just completely butchered your ideas of inner court and outer court. Oh well.)<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            I'd want to turn the domino 90 degrees and use right/left rather than front/back.  Why?  it means I can look at the domino in advance and insert at least a little bit of strategy into the decision, since I chose whihc end is to my right.<br/><br/>Also, it means when i have one opponent, we can slide our dominoes together so th elong sides meet between us and see if I win my offense (my right, his left) or defense (My left, his right) or both or neither.  That seems like a kind of neat physical gesture.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Hmmm. Part of the point for me was that this was a random method. Another part was the symbolism of pointing the domino towards the opponent. It works spatially a little like John's Agon thing where you roll your sword die with your right hand and your shield die with your left. So your "sword" is pointing away from you, towards your opponent, and a notional "shield" is catching your opponent's "sword-thrust" on your left.<br/><br/>Clanging them together would be cool, though.<br/><br/>I should have said, to make it clearer, that in my mind "active" more or less equals "attack", "reactive" equals "defence" and "interactive" means something about the relationship between the characters.<br/><br/>Not that the application I have in mind uses physical combat very much, so attack and defense are themselves metaphors. Lots of metaphorical layering going on here.                        </div>

                            Don't forget they make six- and nine-pipped dominoes.<br/><br/>I like Rob's idea of matching dominoes with a bit of strategy. Doubles should do something special, regardless.<br/><br/>That weird progression looks like it wants to be part of some non-standard supers game, maybe where you really have to work to use your powers to pull off the neat special effects.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>

                            Indeed, they do make "double-nine" domino sets - in fact, I have one. Also (according to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominoes" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>) double 12, double 15 and double 18, though I've never seen those.<br/><br/>I agree that doubles should do something special, not sure what yet.<br/><br/>Yes, the strange progression with lots of low numbers and a few high does look like a Supers game. Maybe you could use a domino draw for character creation (deciding on the level of powers). Don't forget that the sequence as I give it above includes all the possibilities - there is an equal (1 in 28) chance of every number except 4, 6 and 12, which have two chances each.                        </div>

                            Pictures (and ordering) for double-12, -15 and -18 sets visible <a href="http://www.dominomarket.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=CTGY&amp;Category_Code=DOM" rel="nofollow">here</a>. FWIW, it looks like that vendor also does customizing, so you can get words or a logo on the back of your bones.<br/><br/>Having a quarter of the results come out a zero makes me want to come up with a Palladium to-hit joke. Nah, it's too easy.<br/><br/>Running with the idea: So say everyone has a set of dominoes, and they pull four or six as a starting hand. Magical conflict or task rules apply, then you go to the bones to see who wins. Players are going to strategically choose what they want to play, knowing that the played domino is out of the game; so you've got a bit of resource management for when you intentionally want to fail a "roll." Mechanically, either add the pips or multiply them (statistical analysis pending), in either case treating blanks as ones or sevens (once again waiting to hear back from the math lab). In the simplest case, doubles are automatic "I win" plays, with higher numbers breaking ties; 3-3 beats 2-2. Alternatively, doubles allow you cool narrative powers.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>
