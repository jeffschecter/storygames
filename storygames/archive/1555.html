                    So, I was thinking that there's actually two definitions of what an indie game is that float around in the various RPG forums.<br/><br/>There's indie games, which conform to the definition as used by Ron Edwards et al; they're creator-owned, self-financed labours of love which aren't put out by mainstream roleplaying publishers.<br/><br/>And then there's "indie" games, which in the minds of many are all tied up with Forge theory, and in particular exploring interesting Narrativist approaches to gaming (seeing how Gamism and Simulationism is more than adequately catered for by mainstream publishers, in the main).<br/><br/>Now, the two things are actually entirely separate from each other, but easily get conflated in people's minds: if you described your game as being an indie RPG, many would think you were going by the first definition, a few confused souls would plump for the second, and a good many would assume both.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Ron Edwards pointed out in the original (and excellent, even if you don't buy into Forge theory) <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/articles/9/" rel="nofollow">Fantasy Heartbreakers</a> essay that most small press D&amp;D knockoffs qualify as indie games, as does <i>The World of Synnibar</i> and <i>FATAL</i>.<br/><br/>And what's more, there's been several instances of mainstream publishers putting out games with an innovative approach to Narrativist play, and which - if you didn't know that they'd been put out by a mainstream publisher, you'd guess that they were indie games. Hogshead Publishing reprinted <i>Nobilis</i> its <i>New Style</i> imprint put out Baron Munchausen, Puppetland/Power Kill, Pantheon and De Profundis. Amber Diceless enjoyed mainstream success (heck, even the RPGPundit loves it), both <i>Pendragon</i> and <i>The Dying Earth</i> introduce personality mechanics to de-emphasise the "player controls the character, GM controls the world" mindset and encourage PCs to behave in a manner true to Arthurian/Vancian narratives, and who could forget <i>Over the Edge</i>?<br/><br/>So, what other examples of "indie" but not indie and indie but not "indie" games are there?                </div>

                            I'm counting Amber Diceless (and Nobilis) as mainstream because they got big enough to get bought up by a mainstream publisher. (Guardians of Order bought Amber Diceless before they went belly-up, and Hogshead snagged Nobilis). Indie purists may feel somewhat more reluctant to let mainstream publishers get their hands on their babies.                        </div>

                            I've always wondered about Monte Cook's Arcana Evolved as an indie game. Of course it's not technically a complete game, but does that matter?

                            Yeah, I had a rant about this on Story Games just a few weeks ago -- <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1307&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow"><b>Rant about "indie" as a term</b></a><br/>(I also posted on my blog as <a href="http://jhkimrpg.livejournal.com/37088.html" rel="nofollow"><b>The meaning of "indie RPG"</b></a>).  <br/><br/>Anyway, I agree with previous posters that getting sold to a mainstream publisher doesn't retroactively make a game non-indie.  However, later editions of the game published without creative control would no longer be indie.  <br/><br/>Anyway, my top indie games of the past would have to include Macho Women With Guns, CORPS, Amber Diceless, Theatrix, and Fudge.  Though the original GURPS and several of the Palladium games (Palladium Fantasy, Robotech, and Rifts) should probably be noted.  I'm not sure about the publishing circumstances of the original Ars Magica.  <br/><br/>Top non-indie thematic games have mostly been covered.

I was just looking at Ars Magica 1st. Here's the <a href="http://www.pen-paper.net/rpgdb.php?op=showbook&amp;bookid=3796" rel="nofollow">Pen and Paper credits</a>:<br/>Jonathan Tweet, Game Design and Development<br/>Mark Reinâ€¢Hagen, Game Design and Development<br/>Lisa Stevens, Design Contribution<br/><br/>Not 100% clear on what Design Contribution means exactly, but since Mark and Jonathan founded and owned Lion Rampant, I think there's a pretty good chance that the first edition qualified as Indie.                        </div>

If I recall correctly, I think the definition that has been used in the past at The Forge is that the owner had to write more than 50% of the book. So I'd wonder about the three people that are listed as authors that are not owners of the company, to my knowledge. Personally, I'm in favor of creators keeping ownership of all their ideas with no leeway as the definition of Indie, but realistically the line has to be drawn somewhere. But I'm not able to impose my definition on the Forge, nor would I wish to be able to do so.<br/><br/>As for art, I know that Ron, for instance, has made a point that he does not buy art. He merely buys the right to print the art in his books. The artists retain rights to their work. I think that's an admirable and honest way to approach the issue.                        </div>

                            You should check out John Kim's link above for some of the nuances of this issue. My argument is that the Forge definition is more appropriately stated "designer-owned", as Forge discussions almost always assume creator = designer. Thus using artists, layout artists, and sometimes even "writers" is OK... But if you want to check out the nuances, try looking them up in JK's link.                        </div>

Hey Elliot,<br/><br/>I don't mean to come off as snarky, but what's the conclusion? I didn't think I made one.<br/><br/>No problem, Thor. You wrote, "if they can't take ownership of their work, then it was not independently published." You didn't originally account for the work-for-hire issue, though you have now. I agree that calling someone an "author" and then not having them among the owners is a bit iffy (at best) in terms of the indie definition, though again we don't really know if the owner-authors wrote more than 50% of the work. Similarly the "contributors" undoubtedly have some of their "work" in the game. You originally wrote that if they can't take ownership of that, the game wasn't independently published.<br/><br/>The funny thing about the 50% rule is that if I do 30% of the work on a game as a freelancer, while the owner does 55%, then the game is indie. But if I do 30% of the work while the owner does 45%, then the game isn't indie. "Indie" doesn't mean the minority contributors have ownership; it just means the owner's more of a creator than a manager.                        </div>

                            Indie is still a convenience term outside the Forge developer community. People are grappling for terms to define concepts that haven't had long to age and become part of the jargon among the audience at large. At least until "indie" is defined in D&amp;D 5.0.<br/><br/>As for indie vs. small press vs. undie, the only company that I'd call mainstream is WotC. Watching other companies I used to think of as mainstream fall apart has redefined my perceptions.                        </div>

As Russell noted, the term "indie" is used in many contexts outside of the Forge.  <br/><br/>More importantly, I don't think that only the hot new games are the ones that matter.  Many "historical" games are still in print, or if not at least their authors are still around and deserve recognition.  I think it is a flaw of the RPG market that RPGs are often considered like periodicals -- that gamers lose sight of anything not published in the past 2-3 years, and instead are hotly waiting on the next new thing coming out.  <br/><br/>For example, I know that Greg Porter was at the Gen Con Indy Forge booth this year, selling his relatively new Infinite Armies -- but also many of his older games like EABA, Macho Women With Guns, and so forth.  I think we can and should support "historical" games.                        </div>

I think it is a flaw of the RPG market that RPGs are often considered like periodicals -- that gamers lose sight of anything not published in the past 2-3 years, and instead are hotly waiting on the next new thing coming out.<br/><br/>For example, I know that Greg Porter was at the Gen Con Indy Forge booth this year, selling his relatively new Infinite Armies -- but also many of his older games like EABA, Macho Women With Guns, and so forth. I think we can and should support "historical" games.<br/><br/>So do I, but I don't think particularly the Forge should.  The Forge's mission, insofar as I understand it, is to help people bring their ideas to market.  By definition, with any older game that has already happened.<br/><br/>I mean, I'm not in the hot new game camp, last night I ran little black book Traveller, Monday I'm running Pendragon and Space 1889 is one of my favourite games.  Thing is, what games I like and wish to support through my posting has little to do with what the Forge as a website is for.<br/><br/>As for indie as a term, the Forge definition is at least comprehensible and rightly or wrongly is increasingly what people mean when they use the term.  Really, in our field, the term is a nonsense anyway as there isn't really much of a mainstream beyond DnD to be indie to.                        </div>

I'm fine with the Forge definition.  The Forge definition (or variations thereof like the Indie RPG Awards) is what I've been talking about -- it's inclusive of all creator-owned/creator-controlled games like Swashbuckler, Army Ants, Macho Women With Guns, CORPS, and Theatrix.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure what the disagreement here is.                        </div>

<p>I'm totally, 100% with John. The independence of a publisher with regard to outside financial interests makes a game something different, whatever the content winds up being.</p>
<p>Shock: has a lot of words in it by Ben Lehman. He owns those words. By our agreement, I get to use them in all versions of Shock:, but anything else I want to use them for, I have to ask him and make an agreement, probably involving the trade of resources.</p>
<p>That means some important stuff. It means that I can choose to use other game fiction if I want to and take his out (fat chance). It means that he gets to say if it gets put in an anthology or whatever and gets to say under what terms that happens. It means I get to figure out the pricing on Shock:, the color of the cover, and whatever else.</p>
<p>Neither of these things would be true if we'd done it for someone else. And the products of our labors would have come out differently because we'd have been performing the will of another party because then it would be <em>their</em> money and effort on the line.</p>
<p>It's totally legit to publish something independently and then sell it. At that point on, someone else owns it and makes all the decisions about it, even if they're real nice to you about it, and that makes it no longer independently published.</p>
<p>Now, if I'd <em>bought</em> those words from Ben? I dunno. By word count, it's very close to 50/50. It's a long short story and a densely written game (yes, OK, there are some things that need clarification. Make believe there aren't). Would I have to write filler text to make it "indie"?</p>
<p>I dunno! Let's find a real world test case and worry about it then.</p>
