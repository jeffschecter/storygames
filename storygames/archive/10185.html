Reclusice guys (or girls) who spend most of their time locked in their rooms, alone and depressed. Hikikomori being the japanese term for such people.<br/><br/>Here I present you the results of my first game.<br/><br/>-----<br/><b>The story of Kiyoshi, The Hikikomori</b><br/><br/><b>Day one</b><br/><br/>Today I decided I'd get out, if at least for a little while, maybe take some fresh air but, when I made it out and started walking down the street there were so many people I started to freak out. Luckily I found a new hobby store. I made my way in, bought a few plastic figures and then went home as fast as posible.<br/><br/>On my way home I ran into Kimiko... the old class rep. i hadn't seen her for at least 6 months since school finished and I would have rather not run into her. She decided she'd walk me home. she looked all worried and tried to "cheer me up" but it didn't quite make it for me, it was annoying. When we finally got home I asked her what it was that she wanted from me. She told me some stuff I didn't know. She said she had worried over me ever since high school, that she had a brother who also was a loner... and spent too much time locked in his room, that after some time and help from his family he made it out. I don't know why, but that sort of makes me feel... hopeful.<br/><br/>I made it to my room, I set to paint my newly acquired figures when I suddenly started feeling really dizzy, I laid down for some time trying to endure the feeling. I wasn't about to go out to see a doctor... not really a good idea to go out again that day. So I finally sat up and got painting.<br/><br/>I don't know how much time I spent on the figures, but, when I was finally done it was really dark and silent outside. The clock marked 5am. I went to sleep...<br/><br/><br/><b>Day two</b><br/><br/>I woke up late because of my late night the night before. When I was awake I noticed the figures I had been working on looked like shit, I shouldn't have made so much work instead of sleeping, I became too sloppy. I immediately set out to re-paint the whole thing, now being fully awake.<br/><br/>Afternoon kicked in and I was still fixing my figures when I got a call from Kimiko. Even though the day before she managed to reach out to me, today I really wasn't about to take anything from her, so I made up excuses and hung up un her real quick so i could go on with the painting. <br/><br/>Somehow, it made me feel awful after a little while, she was only trying to help and I ignored her because of some stupid plastic figures. I really am one stupid fuck.<br/><br/>As I sat on my bed thinking over and over about this I started to feel dizzy again. Not being in the mood for anything and being that it was dark out anyway I went to sleep.<br/><br/><br/><b>Day three</b><br/><br/>When I wake up I was decided I would get rid of this obsession. I called Kimiko back and asked her to come by and help me stuff my figures away. I didn't want to see any of that stuff again, and I was  glad Kimiko was there. <br/><br/>Although I don't like being around people, Kimiko didn't make me uncomfortable at all.<br/><br/>That was until I started feeling dizzy after  we finished. Kimiko made me go see a doctor. I don't like hospitals, too many people. I had to spend the night there, Kimiko can go too far some times. I just wanted it all to end and be able to get back home to my room the next day.<br/><br/><b>Day Four</b><br/><br/>After finaly being back to my room I really didn't feel like doing anything. With all my figures stuffed away and myself not willing to give back up to them I just lay on the floor staring at at nothing in particular. After a while Kimiko came in. I was really mad at her for making me go to the doctor and making me stay a night at a hospital. So I just ignored her the whole time.<br/><br/>But what I didn't count on was that she would actually be all the more determined to "help" me... Let's see how that goes.<br/><br/><br/><b>Day Five</b><br/><br/>When I woke up I was still in no mood to do anything, but I turned on the TV and while watching it some TV show kind of got me thinking. I meditated on the situation, and all that Kimiko was trying to do for me. I felt like an idiot for getting mad at her and called her to apologize.<br/><br/>When i called her she seemed to get really happy. She even came by the house earlier than normal. With my renewed attitude I let her take me out of the house for a walk. I was afraid I would freak out or something, but having Kimiko by my side really helped me. I think I even enjoyed the walk. Kimiko is a really nice girl and i think we're growing closer together.<br/><br/><br/><b>Day Six</b><br/><br/>I woke up feeling quite strange, Is this feeling happiness?<br/><br/>I called Kimiko and told her to meet me at the park. I wanted to show her I can do it and that her efforts have really made a difference. I went out to meet her, it felt really good being outside, and much better being with her. We started chatting trivial stuff and walking. When we finally sit on a bench it is then that I realize how beautiful the world can be and I understand my life is finally taking some direction.<br/><br/>I ask Kimiko to meet me again the next day, but this time I tell her to meet me downtown.<br/><br/><br/><b>Day Seven</b><br/><br/>I finally decide I want to take a step forward:<br/><br/>I borrow some clothes from my father and take a bus downtown. I am really nervious. On my way to meet Kimiko I manage to buy some flowers for her. My heart is pounding. I see her there, at the spot we agreed upon by a fountain near the comercial district. When i see her I'm stuned, She looks gorgeous in a yellow dress. I give her the flowers and she gives me a hug back.<br/><br/>We set out on my very first date. When we were still in highschool I hadn't noticed it, but she is a really beautiful girl. Now that we've spent so much time together i realize how nice a person she is too.<br/><br/>We go shopping, we get something to eat and we even take some photos of us at a photo booth.<br/><br/>After such a great day, when we make it back to her place, we both stand at her door... I say good bye to her, and I also thank her for being so compasionate to a total extranger; Someone who had been so indiferent to her for so long.<br/><br/>She then leans forward and kisses me gently on the lips. This is not only the first time I've been kissed... but also the very first time I've felt something like this for anyone.<br/><br/>She reincorporates and finally says:<br/><br/>"Even if we never talked before, you were never a stranger to me"<br/><br/><b>Epilogue</b><br/><br/>After these seven days I have not become any more social a person. I am still rather reclusive too. But I now have Kimiko in my life. And that is all that matters to me.<br/><br/>Maybe some day I will no longer be a Hikikomori....<br/><br/>-----                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226106/#Comment_226106" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-20T02:15:55+00:00" title="August 20, 2009  2:15AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Initial traits:<br/><br/>Hope 3<br/>Obsessive Hobby (Plastic Figures) 3<br/>Rescuer (Kimiko) 3<br/>Health Problem (Mal Nutrition) 3<br/><br/><br/>Final traits:<br/><br/>Hope: 9<br/>Rescuer (Kimiko): 9<br/><br/><br/><br/>Playing this almost got me crying, i really got to care for my characters and was really realeaved to see Kiyoshi could make such great advancement.<br/><br/>Now, I feel identified with this game because I used to be prettu much like that when I was a teen ager.
