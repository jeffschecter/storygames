It's is the "prompt" for the players. "You are standing in an open field west of a white house, with a boarded front door. There is a small mailbox here. What do you do?" Especially say this after some sort of block. "The stone slab doesn't budge. What do you do?" The one exception is when you've just said something to them as an NPC. "What'd ye fancy folk be wanting in an inn like this?" The second exception is when you said something that requires mechanical work for them, like giving them a DC.</dd>\n<dt>What are you doing, exactly?/How do you do that?</dt><dd>When players don't convey their execution clearly. "We search for traps" "What are you doing, exactly?"</dd>\n<dt>What are you saying, exactly?</dt><dd> When players shortcut over RP scenes that you want to play out. "We ask her for the map." "What are you saying, exactly?" Only do this when there's uncertainty. If there's no conflict, <em>do</em> still answer them in character as the NPC, but you don't have to dwell on what they said diegetically to initiate the conversation.</dd>\n<dt>That is how it is / That is how it is, now / Weird right? But that's what you see</dt><dd>When there's an object or event in the shared imagined space that's unusual or surprising and the players express doubt. "It's ridiculous that there would be a tiger here!" "Weird, right? But that's what you see. What do you do?"</dd>\n<dt>When you [part of multi-part action].../ As soon as you [part of multi-part action]...</dt><dd> When the players chain multiple executions and effects together in one statement, and you need to time rewind in order to settle the earliest uncertain one, if any. "We wrap the body in a carpet, go to the street, hail a cab to the harbor and dump the body in, looking at the black water as it sinks." "Would you make an encounter check please?" "It's a one" "When you're waiting for a cab, with the rolled up carpet, you notice a trio of greybearded men in short shoulder capes and black suits staring at you from the other side of the street. What do you do?" Don't do this if there's no uncertain executions. In that case, just go along the full chain. "OK, the body is in the water. What do you do?"</dd>\n<dt>Does that seem reasonable?</dt><dd>When you're not sure you've got buy-in from the table, or when you want to make sure you're making a good ruling. Use carefully; it can both increase or decrease buy-in depending on the situation. In my experience when you're making a more mechanical ruling, it's good to ask if it seems reasonable, but when you're describing diegetic elements, it's better to just stick to your guns.</dd>\n<dt>It's [time&amp;circumstances].

What if the party would've given up after two days? By asking, you open up for "OK, we wait for three hours". You might know that the thing shows up after two hours, or four days, or whatever. BTW don't make the answer up <em>after</em> getting the time span from the players, that's cheating.</dd>\n<dt>How many times do you do it?</dt><dd>Similar to the time span question, but when they're doing something repeatedly, like "I smash the button over and over again".</dd>\n<dt>That's [time span], so that'll be [number] encounter checks. OK?</dt><dd>Also a way to request for a decision point to end, or fast-forward, a "scene" without camera terms.

I added both of these. I do use "Does that seem reasonable?" a lot but I want to evaluate that usage and the consequences of that usage more as I refine my technique.<br/><br/>As for "How do you do that?", I'm afraid I'll sound sarcastic. "Well, how do you think you're doing <i>that</i>, young lady?"<br/><br/>WarriorMonk, thanks for the list! Some I've already got on there, some I haven't had such good results with. I was just about to add "Assuming ... / I assume ..." but usually I prefer questions. "Assuming you still have your armor on" vs "Do you keep your armor on?", or "You're still striking every floor tile with your poles as you go, right?"<br/><br/>I'm going to add my own take on "For Your Eyes Only" on my next edit pass. It's going to be "Do <i>not</i> show the other players this!" I'll probably look through your list a little more on future passes too. It's a great summary of techniques from a variety of styles, some clashing with this, some very compatible.<br/><br/>As far as "And... scene" goes, I've tried that many times and it often goes really badly. I'm going to try to find another key phrase for that. Like, jump to describing the current circumstances and go "What do you do?" "OK, so it's the next morning. What do you do?" I'll add something like that. Oh, and I want one sort of like "You wanted to see [person], right? What do you do?" To prompt a start of a dramasystem/fiasco-like scene w/o speaking in camera terms like "scenes", "cutting" etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461618">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461618/#Comment_461618" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-03T20:04:42+00:00" title="April  3, 2017  8:04PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 3, 2017 8:05PM by Paul_T.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Fade to black" works, sometimes.

I believe it's "...and so it was." <br/><br/>I wouldn't worry too much about the wording sounding a certain way. You're right that it's a legitimate worry, but, in my experience, that's much more about delivery than about the words used.<br/><br/>"Cool, how do you do that?", delivered with an enthusiastic smile, is great.<br/><br/>I can't think of any phrase that <i>couldn't</i> be delivered in a sarcastic tone of voice and sound condescending or judgmental.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461619/#Comment_461619" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-03T20:08:58+00:00" title="April  3, 2017  8:08PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I did add "How do you do that?" as an option but I'm going to stick with "What are you doing, exactly?"

A very important GM task for sure!  I'm not sure if this is the best way to label it, though.  "When you.../ As soon as you..." could mean anything; I have to read ahead to get it.<br/><br/>To me, the key GM action here is refusing to let the fiction advance past a certain point of relevant uncertainty, to which end I invoke:<br/><br/><b>Wait!</b> or <b>Hang on!</b> or <b>Before you [subsequent action]...</b>\n<blockquote><b>Does that seem reasonable?</b> When you're not sure you've got buy-in from the table, or when you want to make sure you're making a good ruling.

Don't do the former.<br/><br/>Agreed?  Or did you have something else in mind?\n<blockquote><b>It's [time&amp;circumstances].

I'm not sure if I ever actually use this outside of the player characters waiting for an event, and me saying, "Okay, now that event occurs!"<br/>\n<blockquote><b>You wanted to go see [person], right? What do you do?</b> A way to introduce a new interaction scene without speaking in author stance / story game terms.</blockquote>I find this prompt broadly useful across all situations where the players had a goal or next step in mind:<br/><br/><b>You wanted to [whatever they wanted to do next], right? What do you do?</b>\n<blockquote><b>Do you...? / You're still..., right?</b> Sometimes it's good to ask questions circumstances. "You're still wearing your armor, right?"</blockquote>For me this is a subset of <b>What are you doing, exactly?/How do you do that?</b>  It's part of the conversation wherein I get the info I need from the players.<br/><br/>I guess other times I might inquire just for the sake of making my own (or the group's) imagined picture more vivid... but that seems like a different endeavor than most of the stuff on this list?\n<blockquote><b>Scratch one...</b> Scratch one arrow, one ration etc.</blockquote>I say "scratch <i>off</i> one".  :P\n<blockquote><b>How long are you prepared to wait?</b> By asking, you open up for "OK, we wait for three hours".

It's really important to explain that to the readers.<br/><br/>I purposely put in the list techniques that are even conflicting themselves, as it was meant to be a list of different techniques used in different games by different groups to achieve different atmospheres and gameplay. I discarded a lot that sounded similar or that did a mix of things that two or more techniques already did, though that was more for the sake of clarity. For efficiency purposes, techniques that do two or more things should be welcomed. Adding different choices of phrasing to each technique should help readers a lot to understand how it's meant to be said and when.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461637/#Comment_461637" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-03T22:59:54+00:00" title="April  3, 2017 10:59PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>I use an offhand, "How you goin' about that?" to express curiosity and my own un-serious desire to better visualize what's going on.<br/><br/>In the case where there is danger but I don't want to telegraph that because the characters aren't aware of it, I try to start with the chill version.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/></blockquote>\nInteresting.

I'll argue against "Wait" and "Hold on" later but intent clashes is one place where I kind of do tend to go to them. As a player as much as a Dm.

"When you.../ As soon as you..." could mean anything; I have to read ahead to get it.</blockquote>\nI was about to change the formatting to use some sort of brackets and variables, but... I'm not sure in what way. "When you..." or "As soon as you..." are so good for this.\n<blockquote>To me, the key GM action here is refusing to let the fiction advance past a certain point of relevant uncertainty, to which end I invoke:<br/><br/><b>Wait!</b> or <b>Hang on!</b> or <b>Before you [subsequent action]...</b></blockquote>\nMy design choice here to <em>not</em> do this was deliberate. A deliberate but subtle invalidation of their action chain. Not always detected and designed to just move the action forward from my interruption on. A "wait" or "hang on" is always detected. And the "before you [subsequent action]" acknowledges their subsequent action which has issues, whether that action does come to fruition or not. While I sometimes do "As soon as you [their canon action] on your way to [their desired follow up]", I want to avoid it if I can convey the canon action only and focus on it.<br/><br/>"We pick up the boulder and toss it." "When you pick it up, you notice that it's pretty sticky. What do you do?" \u2190 Folks, that is smooth!\n<blockquote><blockquote><b>Does that seem reasonable?</b> When you're not sure you've got buy-in from the table, or when you want to make sure you're making a good ruling. Use carefully; it can both increase or decrease buy-in depending on the situation.</blockquote>I'd specify when it can decrease buy-in.  In my experience, that's only when the GM is asking the players to do the GM's job, rather than simply double-checking that they've done their job to the group's satisfaction.  Do that latter.  Don't do the former.<br/><br/>Agreed?  Or did you have something else in mind?</blockquote>\nYes, I mean something else; I'll edit my OP to reflect this explicitly. I think it generally increases buy-in when used for mechanics rulings, and decreases buy-in when used for diegetic elements. With a couple of exception in both directions, but that's the general split. "There's a... white rabbit in a cage in her bedroom, does that seem reasonable?" would decrease buy-in according to that theory, but "I'm going to treat this as a 'grapple', does that seem reasonable?" seems OK. I don't know. This one came from Airk and I need as many olive branches with him as I can because we often think so differently from each other.\n<blockquote><blockquote><b>It's [time&amp;circumstances]. What do you do? </b>A way to cut to a new scene without speaking in camera terms like scenes and cutting.</blockquote>I'd hesitate to include this without further clarification about when it should and shouldn't be used.  I'm not sure if I ever actually use this outside of the player characters waiting for an event, and me saying, "Okay, now that event occurs!"</blockquote>\nThis was a new addition but I'm going to experiment with it and report back my findings!\n<blockquote><blockquote><b>You wanted to go see [person], right? What do you do?</b> A way to introduce a new interaction scene without speaking in author stance / story game terms.</blockquote>I find this prompt broadly useful across all situations where the players had a goal or next step in mind:<br/><br/><b>You wanted to [whatever they wanted to do next], right? What do you do?</b></blockquote>\nI specifically want to hillfolkify the D&amp;D right under the player's noses, so setting up scenes with them and another PC/NPC without speaking in terms of setting up scenes, framing etc is the goal of this. Taking their minds off their next &amp; current goal and bring it back to relationship woes. But, this key phrase is also still only on paper.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461656/#Comment_461656" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T06:51:07+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  6:51AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><b>Do you...? / You're still..., right?</b> Sometimes it's good to ask questions circumstances.

I had in my mind a specific, functional example from when I was a player in Labyrinth Lord. We had put in a couple of instints which we took from Burning Wheel. Our DM had no familiarity with Burning Wheel but we didn't use those terms. We just made clear: "We <em>always</em> look up to the ceiling before we step foot in a room, and we <em>always</em> hit any floor tile as hard as we can with our tenfoots before we step on it for the first time. We'll note the exceptions." And he added noise levels &amp; times on the turn order accordingly. And he'd occasionally say "You're still hitting the tiles, right? Well, in that case you find that there was a trap door here." That DM's language there was what I was trying to emulate but I missed the mark.<br/><br/>The addition was also prompted by WarriorMonk's suggestion "Assuming..."<br/>I'm going to remove it.<br/><br/>At first I was thinking of just going "If... then...", but now I'm thinking of maybe something like "Because you..."<br/>"Because you have your armor on, they can hear you pretty easily."<br/>\n<blockquote><blockquote><b>Scratch one...</b> Scratch one arrow, one ration etc.</blockquote>I say "scratch <i>off</i> one".  :P</blockquote>\nI can add that to the list, sure.\n<blockquote><blockquote><b>How long are you prepared to wait?</b> By asking, you open up for "OK, we wait for three hours". You might know that the thing shows up after two hours, or four days, or whatever.</blockquote>Absolutely.<br/><br/>I view time as an investment, and I handle other investments of resources similarly:<br/><br/>How many times are you willing to get stabbed by the needle in the lock mechanism?  How many magical questions do you want to use up interrogating this enchanted item?  How long are you willing to grind away at this combination lock before you give up if you haven't opened it yet?<br/><br/>So, uh, maybe... <b>How much/many of [time or precious resources] are you investing in this?</b> to cover all the bases?</blockquote>\nSounds a little clumsy, agreed? I think I'll change it to "How many times do you do it?" and "For how long?", for actions vs time, respectively.<br/>\n<blockquote>I purposely put in the list techniques that are even conflicting themselves, as it was meant to be a list of different techniques used in different games by different groups to achieve different atmospheres and gameplay.</blockquote>\nYeah, I noticed, and that makes your list very valuable for what it is. I'm trying to design a very specific game[*] so I want to find key phrases that further the goals of that game specifically.<br/><br/>[*] Historically what I'm designing would fall under "Dungeon Master advice" since I'm still using the rules of 5e. But I'm taking cues from other games and I'm also trying to mash Hillfolk in there, pretty forcefully at times. So, how about I call it I'm designing a specific "game play pattern", rather than specific "game".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461668/#Comment_461668" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-04T15:07:05+00:00" title="April  4, 2017  3:07PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>I did<a href="https://resourcefullrpg.wordpress.com/2013/07/31/techniques/" rel="nofollow"> this</a> some time ago, hope it helps.</blockquote>I was just about to go hunting for your thread here about that!

Like if we're playing a game set in 1905 and a player thinks of course every house should have a phone and I want to explain that our 1905 setting doesn't work like that.

It can help to move player interests away from protecting their character and more towards exploration of the situation.<br/><br/>That being said, I think when we are playing D&amp;D with a more war game centric approach a credibility test is exactly what we are looking for. We want to put the player on edge - put them into a spot where they are forced to show how they are getting there. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461778">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461778/#Comment_461778" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-07T12:38:12+00:00" title="April  7, 2017 12:38PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only goes to show how much choice of key phrases can matter.

But... some examples where I might use "WAYDE" are:<br/><br/>"We search for traps" or "We search for hidden doors", things that would be handled by a mechanic in other games.<br/><br/>And where I'd use "WAYSE" is when they do things like "We demand the map from her" instead of saying what they're saying. Also things that would fly in other games.<br/><br/>Some defensiveness is OK because I want the situation to suddenly gain a bit of an edge. "Oh, shit, it's suddenly important exactly how I open this door? It's got to be trapped!".

This system allows more things to be rolled openly. It's not great for every situation but it sings sometimes. Like when the party robs a tomb and contracts a curse similar to Lovecraft's "The Hound" story and will be\u2026 visited\u2026 in 3d8 days or similar.

Same goes for the "oh, shit, it's action time" feeling of "roll initiative". The DMG provides for a fixed 'initiative score' and I use and love that option.<br/><br/>"What do you do?" is such a miraculous panacea that I can understand that you might see it as evidence of failure (if there's medicine, there's got to be disease, right?). But it's proven itself to work so well in my experience, on both sides of the screen. It helps with framing, it helps with stance focus, it helps with conversation flow, it helps with prompting options other than just preselected at-will-options on the char sheet, it clarifies or prompts IIEE-level questions, and it is in and of itself a didactic tool. It's more vitamin than medicine\u2665<br/><br/>I mean, in a game (unlike mine) where players are supposed to add diegetic elements, it could be considered an educative failure to have to ask them "Is there one?", they should've provided it themselves in that paradigm. &lt;- This is rhetorical, such questions are in and of themselves play-shaping and facilitating. Conveyance and affordance are important even in our choices of prompts and key phrases.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461828/#Comment_461828" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-09T15:12:54+00:00" title="April  9, 2017  3:12PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Roll initiative</b><br/>It's time to start looking at a certain area of the roleplaying sheet, and get in a certain mental state.</blockquote>Great point about transitioning focus and mental state.

"We search for traps" "What are you doing, exactly?"<br/></blockquote>\nMy favourite way to phrase this is, "What does that look like?" It helps encourage players to think visually about what their characters are doing. "In the movie/TV show version of this, we see..."<br/><br/></blockquote>\nI really like "what does that look like?" as the player prompt for more detail for a few reasons. <br/><br/>Firstly, yes, it asks the player to visualise their character's actions, but it also gives the player permission to use this moment to present their character to the table. Manoeuvring the player to use visual language isn't necessarily aping TV, it's opening up a space where the player can be the story-teller for a bit and use some of the descriptive language typically reserved for the DM. These moments are important to give a player the spotlight in the group if they want it and encourages a descriptive agency over their character.<br/><br/>Secondly, I think preferring "what does that look like?" over "what do you do, exactly?" enables players to provide those key clarifying details the DM needs but without backing the player into a place where they think they need a specific answer to advance. As a player this sudden demand for specific information can be slightly intimidating as it indicates that I'm risking some kind of failure state, and as a DM I've seen players shift their attitudes accordingly and mire play in micro-actions to try feel out the hinted threat. <br/><br/>Asking what an activity looks like also helps players who might only know what their character's activity is in an abstract sense. As a player, asking me exactly what my character is doing to pick a lock is likely to get me thinking about a real mechanics of lock lockpicking - which I know nothing about! Hesitant guesses are likely to frustrate both me and the DM as we back-and-forth over an imaginary object with incomplete information! <br/>But getting the player to think about the "look" of lockpicking in a more abstract way will likely elicit workable information about how their character approaches the task without having to devote table-time to the real-world functioning of tumblers. <br/><br/>Of course, some situations do need "what do you do, exactly?" and it can be loads of fun, but keeping the language in the visual for the most part gives players more chances to be the story-teller without triggering slow-and-cautious critical/technical thinking when it's not required/desired. <br/><br/>***<br/><br/>Different thought: I see "you" being used a lot to interact with the player above. I think there's something to be said for the DM using character names and keeping a third-person perspective on the narrative. It is perhaps harder on the DM, but I like it as a unobtrusive roleplaying prompt. <br/><br/>That one all depends on personal taste, I suppose.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461880">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461880/#Comment_461880" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-11T20:13:12+00:00" title="April 11, 2017  8:13PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, using character names always always always ftw.

"Is there one", is a reminder for something that I had to go through with the players at the start of the session. The 'cut' gesture is used all the time when I play collaborative storytelling (I refuse using the terms "GM-full/-less").\n<blockquote>"What do you do?" is such a miraculous panacea that I can understand that you might see it as evidence of failure (if there's medicine, there's got to be disease, right?).

I'm opposed that phrase because it's overused and covers up sloppy descriptions. Sure, just like "Are you sure?", I use it if I failed with my descriptions. It's human to fail, and then those phrases are nice things to fall back on.<br/><br/>But my descriptions should never render my players passive. There are lots of tricks in how to avoid that or, more precisely, in how make them more active. "What do you do?" is, to me, just something that covers up something that can be done in a good way in the first place. "What do you do" is like trying to come up with rewarding mechanics (bonuses, points, succeeding rolls), when rewarding mechanics are, in  90% of the cases, just a patchwork for something that is usually bad to begin with.<br/><br/>Also, in a normal conversation or discussion, you never need to use "What do you do?". It's a fluid dynamic of who will talk next; a common understanding between social people.

I just wanted to quickly pick at some of the qualities it has that make it, in my opinion, a versatile phrase in the DM toolkit. <br/><br/>From your response, I get the feeling that we perhaps have different ideas about what 'taking on the story-teller stance' means? I may have not been clear, but what I was thinking of was players being able to make descriptive embellishments to their functional input to the game. To state to the table the how their character goes about an activity and to add incidental details. My conception of the 'story-teller stance' here isn't a player having total narrative control for a time, but rather to be the literal story teller around the physical table - the attention of the group is on them and their character just for this moment. Maybe 'spotlight' is a better way of putting it, but either way it's that opportunity to be creative/descriptive as a player above just providing input to the DM-computer. \n<blockquote><blockquote>as a DM I've seen players shift their attitudes accordingly and mire play in micro-actions to try feel out the hinted threat.</blockquote>\nBut, that's... kind of what I want? Or what I've had good experience with. </blockquote>\nGreat! If that's what you want then you now know what to avoid. I feel like I've been useful! <br/><br/>Sometimes "what are you doing, exactly" is precisely what the moment requires and breaking play down into intensely scrutinising the imagined space and activity can be incredibly rewarding. <br/><br/>However, it's only rewarding if there is actually a failure state that the player risks through improper handling of the imagined activity and the imagined space is handled coherently by the DM. We can all see how fun it might be to have a character dismantle a booby-trap in a dungeon by describing their exact actions, but how painful that process could be if the DM and the player miscommunicate at any point. Frankly, I could do with a glossary of key phrases just to help me describe spaces and objects that players are interacting with precisely. \n<blockquote><br/>Also, in a normal conversation or discussion, you never need to use "What do you do?". It's a fluid dynamic of who will talk next; a common understanding between social people. Roleplaying games shouldn't be that different.</blockquote>\nIsn't "what do you do?" always implicit whenever a DM stops speaking and turns to the players for their reactions?<br/><br/>I can sympathise with your distaste for the phrase if you want (and can have) a more naturalistic back-and-forth between DM and player, but roleplaying games aren't normal conversation and failure to be normal conversation isn't a criteria that roleplaying games can be judged on.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461902/#Comment_461902" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-12T21:46:53+00:00" title="April 12, 2017  9:46PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 12, 2017 9:49PM by David_Berg.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In paradigm: "Vorthos, what do you do?"<br/>Off paradigm: "Anna, what does Vorthos do?"</blockquote>Now that I am thinking about this in more detail, I suspect that my preferences are what they are from habit and familiarity rather than any sort of objective best approach.  I think every approach has trade-offs.  <br/><br/>I actually don't like the GM, who is a real person speaking from without the fiction, saying, "Starchaser, what do you do?" because Starchaser is a fictional person hearing things from within the fiction.  So there's a mismatch there.  <br/><br/>The more generic "What do you do?" (no names used) allows me to not notice this mismatch (though it's still there, as the "you" is Starchaser), whereas the GM saying the character's name highlights the mismatch (for me).<br/><br/>With enough repetition, at this point my brain parses, "What do you do?" as the perfect hybrid of two things.  It's, "Dave, what does your character do?" combined with "and right now you <i>are</i> your character."  I don't think all that is inherently embedded in the GM phrase, but the GM phrase does allow me to parse it that way.<br/><br/>Maybe irrelevant to the project at hand, but I felt like sharing just in case.<br/><br/>If you do decide to go with "Vorthos, what do you do?" I'd recommend specifying that!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461910">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461910/#Comment_461910" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-12T23:33:32+00:00" title="April 12, 2017 11:33PM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2017 5:12AM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Will adress other points but just this quickly: When I do adress someone by name, which is rare, I aspire to use the character name always and the player name never.

When we use it we are trying to shape player behavior towards approaching the game in ways that are not exactly natural, but that we find rewarding. <br/><br/>I would generally not use that specific prompt in a B/X game where I would address the caller and give the players time to conference and come up with a proper stratagem. Generally in a B/X game I would much more directly address the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461917/#Comment_461917" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T06:04:10+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  6:04AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take is that getting someone to identify with another name is so difficult.

It helps to clarify whether you are addressing a character level concern or a player level concern, and can be immensely helpful in a game like Blades in the Dark where we are zooming in and out based on our level of interest. It requires a good deal more comfort with director stance than is typical of a game like Apocalypse World which is far more focused on character level concerns. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_461922">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461922/#Comment_461922" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T07:34:10+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  7:34AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good point, Jonathan.<br/><br/>Now for some of the stuff from when I was too tired earlier this morning:\n<blockquote>I'm absolutely fine with "what does that look like?" not being included if it doesn't suit your needs for this project. I just wanted to quickly pick at some of the qualities it has that make it, in my opinion, a versatile phrase in the DM toolkit.</blockquote>\nYeah, some of those qualities I hadn't thought of and they were of course very appealing.\n<blockquote>I may have not been clear, but what I was thinking of was players being able to make descriptive embellishments to their functional input to the game.</blockquote>\nStory time (this has been told before, but): I run my 5e game a little differently from the OSR groups I've been playing with. I've placed a very high priority on "this is a first-person experience" (to use a video game camera metaphor).<br/><br/>I realized (or "got it into my head") that the way those particular groups ran the game, with a graph paper map in the middle of the table being filled out as we go, for the first couple of sessions the DM had the group's map maker do it, but the DM and group got tired of the constant talking about 45 degree angled walls and exactly how big everything was etc etc. So they switched to the DM just drawing a copy of the map for the group as we went along, and that's how it been since. I realize that that's a local thing, there's a lot of overlap between the two groups (it's pretty much one group with alternating DMs). I joined these groups after they made this transition so for me, sitting there, looking down on the little graph paper dungeon that we were traversing in, I was like <b>"What the hell!? A dungeon for <i>ants</i>!?!?"</b> It felt like we were playing Hero Quest (the board game not the RPG) or some dungeon chess or some other super zoomed-out birds-eye-view thing. (And I still play with them and I accept their ants-dungeoning-ways because when in Rome.)<br/><br/>But for my home group where I DM 5e, which I started after some experience with that drifty retroclone gang, I wanted to design something else. A "first person experience". <em>You</em> are in the dungeon, not your miniature, not some pencil marks on a graph paper map. So my goal is to phrase things in those terms as much as I can. I was like eff all minis, eff the player map! (Instead if they say "We got to the cauldron room" or other room they've already visited I explain the way there. If they want to make a player map, I've suggested they stick to "node maps" with room connections instead of square by square detailed maps. And I have the rule that I as DM never look at or comment on that map or the validity of that map, to reinforce the "the map is not the territory", "the map is not the canon" thing.)<br/><br/>One tool I use to make things easier for the players is that I use the room and the playspace as much as I can. I describe things and door locations airplane stewardess style with hand gestures. I point to things outside ("It's about a third of the size of that building over there"), I use the room we're in ("It's about three times as wide as this room we're in now and three times as long, so nine times as big total" and I sometimes go up and larp things out, and for fighting we remain seated but point at each other "Four goblins are on <em>you</em>[first character] and three are on <em>you</em>[second character]. [Third character], when you see that, what do you do?"<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20652/spatial-relationships-in-verbal-games" rel="nofollow">I described some of the techniques I use for abstracting spatiality in fights here.</a><br/><br/>So my initial impression when I meet this "What does it look like stuff" is that it's been a while since I experimented with that stuff but that it goes counter to the first-person-view experience I'm trying to foster.\n<blockquote>However, it's only rewarding if there is actually a failure state that the player risks through improper handling of the imagined activity and the imagined space is handled coherently by the DM. We can all see how fun it might be to have a character dismantle a booby-trap in a dungeon by describing their exact actions, but how painful that process could be if the DM and the player miscommunicate at any point.</blockquote>\nPainful in terms of hit points! &gt;:D\n<blockquote>Frankly, I could do with a glossary of key phrases just to help me describe spaces and objects that players are interacting with precisely.</blockquote>\nGestures help a lot but yeah, it's difficult.\n<blockquote>... roleplaying games aren't normal conversation and failure to be normal conversation isn't a criteria that roleplaying games can be judged on.</blockquote>\nIn Rickard's defense, some games might have more conversational qualities than others. But I'm with you when it comes to my particular game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_461923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/461923/#Comment_461923" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-04-13T07:38:31+00:00" title="April 13, 2017  7:38AM">April 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 13, 2017 7:39AM by 2097.">edited April 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I'm permitted to make a video game analogy, what I'm thinking about when I'm talking about "first person view" is something akin to this text game: <a href="http://eblong.com/zarf/zweb/huntdark/" rel="nofollow">Hunter, in Darkness</a> by Andrew Plotkin.
