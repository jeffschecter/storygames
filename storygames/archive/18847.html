I believe The Quiet Year is a good example from what I've heard, but I haven't read it. Apocalypse World, in a sense, too (again, not read though). <br/><br/>Alternatively, or combined, I'm looking for stories that lead to an unknown climatic event. This climatic event could be constructed by the players as they go along, perhaps with cues from the game, or determined by mechanics towards the end of the game. For example: in Fiasco you generally don't know who'll end up where at the end. This is a good example. In Our Last Best Hope, you kinda know what the last scene will be about, even if you don't know the outcome: this is not really what I'm looking for. <br/><br/>Anything you think is worth while reading that doesn't fit exactly, but has elements of interest are more than welcome too <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> Thanks for helping me out here!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422091/#Comment_422091" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T08:49:22+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  8:49AM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 27, 2013 8:50AM by Fuseboy.">edited September 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fits perfectly: Microscope.

(It also has a Crossroads track, which is a decision that everyone knows is coming; part of the game involves some players adding implications and consequences to either side of the decision.) When the Crisis track fills up, the players have to decide what the crisis is that the Kingdom faces--this is something that probably makes itself evident over the course of play. Then they vote on whether the Kingdom should perish...or survive the crisis.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422101/#Comment_422101" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T12:00:28+00:00" title="September 27, 2013 12:00PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Quiet Year, Microscope, and How To Host A Dungeon are all games where the primary activity is world-building and roleplaying out scenes is either not present or a much smaller part of the game.<br/><br/>Shock: Social Science Fiction tends to open with a lot of world-building, and in the single-session games of Shock I've played, I'd say the primary activity was world-building and the secondary activity was playing out character stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422129/#Comment_422129" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-09-27T20:12:02+00:00" title="September 27, 2013  8:12PM">September 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In A Wicked Age, at least the way we played it, involves a lot of scenario-building.

There's two main sheets in play: The World Creation Sheet, which has about 6 open areas with questions like "What is a unique feature of the world?", "What is a mystery of the world?" etc. There are also Town Creation Sheets, which are similar but with about 9 open areas for such questions.<br/><br/>In round-robin style, each person gets the sheet, they fill in a section that they want with whatever they want, and pass the sheet to the next person. The next person should read what's there, choose another question and pass it on. Once it goes around the table, any sections left blank are up to the GM to fill out/decide/ignore. <br/><br/>This was a really fulfilling system, albeit stupid simple: Everyone tries to put in something cool an unique, yet still reserved enough to go with everyone else's ideas.
