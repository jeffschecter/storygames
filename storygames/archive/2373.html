                    So I'm GMing Over the Edge the other night and we had all the PCs out individually hunting down their various agendas (which includes, to some degree, hunting each other), and I decided to have them all meet up at the Winds of Change. The Winds of Change is a roving casino run by an otherdimensional hostess, at which people gamble for the ultimate stakes--life&amp;death, age, beauty, happiness, heart's desires.<br/><br/>One PC, Frank, is looking for another PC, Gaelinar, because the latter killed a Satanic Cultist while a ritual linked to the cultist's soul was taking place, at the same time as Frank interrupted the ritual. The upshot, the vile satanist's soul is now inside Frank's body, fighting for control. Frank turned to Sir Arthur Compton, a powerful, crafty and decadent sorceror (who in my head is played by Christopher Lee, <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>), and Compton told Frank to bring Gaelinar to him and he could remove the possessing soul. Compton hasn't said, but I think everyone's pretty well guessed (correctly) that he means no good to Gaelinar in this endeavor.<br/><br/>So Frank and Gael meet up at the Winds of Change and Frank just asks him to come with him to Compton, which Gaelinar declines. He will, however, agree to a wager. He'll go with Frank if Frank wins, but if he wins, Frank has to do a job for him, to be named later (Gaelinar is a nasty criminal type and Frank is a photojournalist jailed for Seeing Too Much, recently released and keeping his head down). So far so good; this sounds interesting and it's getting late, so I end the session there, the actual game to be determined and played out next week. Yay, dramatic tension.<br/><br/>Then Gaelinar's player takes me aside after the sesion, and gleefully relates how if he does lose the game, he's going to follow Frank to the gates of Compton's estate, then make a run for it. I'm like, "You <i>DO</i> realize that the stakes at the WoC are supernaturally enforced?" He's like, "yeah, that's why I chose my wording <i>very carefully</i>." He's thinking the deal requires him to go to the edge of the grounds and no further. I'm like, "I dunno. . ." and he says we can talk more about it later.<br/><br/>So now I'm left with this bad taste in my mouth, and wondering what to do about it. this would irritate me enough if the deal was with an NPC, that is, just between him and me, but I'm twice as miffed that he's doing this to another player. I don't think there was any sense around the room that we were engaging in a "word-the-wish-spell-just-right" style battle of wits; I was just veiwing the exchange, and I'd bet Frank's player was too, as a straightforward, "what's at stake in this conflict" bit of haggling. One player setting it up so even if he loses, he wins, seems pretty dickish.<br/><br/>I'm also dubious about wthe merit of his claim. His exact wording was, "I'll go with you on your little walk to Compton's." I can see where he's deriving the interpretation--he said "Compton'<i><b>s</b></i>, not "Compton, so he doesn't actually have to meet with the guy. But it just seems so. . .flimsy.<br/><br/>But fortunately, I found out about this before the crucial moment, so I can consider what to do about it. Except it's kind of unfortunate, because I feel my hands are somewhat tied. How do I intervene without being quite obviously biased? Or outmaneuver him in-game without being fundamentally unfair? The concept of "GM as referree" breaks down here, because if I rule in favor of Frank's side, that the deal <i>does</i> bind him to honor the spirit of the request, even if my ruling is the objectively "right" one, I'm also obviously ruling in favor of the side I prefer. And if I deal with it "in-character," for instance by having Compton cast sorcerous wards that ensnare him when he's 30 feet away, I'm acting on my desire to not let him, the player, get away with this (in my opinion) asshatted stunt.<br/><br/>As far as the wording of the agreement goes, I think I've got an out. "I'll go with you on your little walk to Compton's" implies that he has to accompany Frank on his <i>entire journey</i>, which includes going in the gate and up to Compton's study. But again, I'm only calling that into play because I know the player's trying to pull a fast one, and I want to block it.<br/><br/>So what do y'all think? Is there a way to deal with this issue without being a punishing GM slapping hands and saying "you're playing wrong, do it right!" Or should I deal with it at all? I'd still be scratching my head on this if it were just a player-GM issue, but as it's a player-player issue, I really, <i>really</i> don't want to gyp the other guy out of his reward, should he win.<br/><br/>(Which is another frustrating aspect of this problem: Frank may not even win the conflict, in which case I'm expending brainpower and angst over an issue that'll never come to bear.)<br/><br/>Little help? <img alt=":\" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/confused.png" title=":\"/><br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>

                            What Shreyas said. <br/><br/>My players do shit like this all the time, with the important difference that they are trying to fool each others characters, not each other. Your player isn't just trying to have his character one over the other character, he's trying to one over the other players. <br/><br/>It also helps if, when things get to an impasse, you have a way to go to the system/mechanics with it. Like having one character roll his "slick fuck" against the casino's "you will fill your side of the wager" to see if his cleverness lets him get away with it.                        </div>

                            I'm not familiar with Over The Edge or how exactly wagers at Winds of Change work exactly, but one main question comes up:  Does the supernatural enforcement power of WoC work off the letter or the spirit of the wager?<br/><br/>If by the letter, then it wouldn't take much stretch of the imagination for someone to inform Frank of this potential loophole and offer to broker the wager for a fee.  Perhaps this sort of thing goes on all the time in the WoC, but it's usually behind closed doors (and no reason to make that an exception here).  You'd have to assume that this isn't the first person in WoC to try and pull a fast one on someone else.<br/><br/>If by the spirit, then Gaelinar is in for a nasty surprise which might leave the player with a bad taste in his mouth.  Perhaps someone else comments on how bold of a wager that is and hint that his plan won't work -- such as "I say, that reminds of me the time a friend wagered a journey with me.  He was killed not two days after he lost the best, but his spirit was forced to walk along with me.  I tell you boy, you're a bold lad -- I would not make such a wager today."<br/><br/>Anyway, those are a couple in-game ideas for handling this situation that might not feel like they smack so much of GM favoritism and give the party who is potentially about to be screwed over (whether Frank unknowingly or Gaelinar though his botched attempt at trickery) a chance to even the odds.                        </div>

                            The game hasn't started yet, right?  Here's one possible choice: Take Frank's player aside and tell him to have his character reiterate the stakes before the game begins next session (this doesn't seem all that unusual), except changing the wording so very very slightly ("And if I win, you'll come with me to talk to Compton") so as to be almost done without thinking (since Frank clearly believes the two phrasings to be equivalent).  Don't mention this to Gaelinar's player.                        </div>

                            First of all, your situation does not really implicate the 'GM as impartial referee' idea. A GM playing that role would simply decide whether and how the rules of the Winds of Change apply to the wager and enforce it impartially. If either player was disappointed or upset, that is not the GM's business. Much as a pickup game basketball player might be upset at a call that they stepped out of bounds when they feel they did not, a player in these games is expected to "get over it" and keep playing. After all, perhaps next time the call will go against the other guy, or perhaps they were out of bounds after all. The implication is more along the lines of the "casual player vs. hardcore player" divide - are players meant to be held to every word that comes out of their mouths, or not? There are good things and bad things about each side, much like the "touch-move" rule in chess. Plenty of people let people touch whatever piece they want in casual games of chess, but touch-move is rigorously enforced at tournaments.<br/><br/>That said, the social-level solutions people have suggested are good, but I wouldn't say anything to one that I wouldn't want them saying to the other.                        </div>

                            What everyone else already said.<br/><br/>My gut response as a GM would be to make the little bastard roll something for it.  I'm not clear on the Winds of Change, but are the stakes supernaturally enforced, or are they enforced by a supernatural entity?  Either way, I'd make the player do a contested roll (or whatever similar mechanic OtE provides) against whatever <em>thing</em> enforces the stakes.  (And if it's some powerful entity that he's doing an end-run around... well, there are consequences for that sort of thing.)  Cause if he wants to play a wiley trickster, then he should be able to.  <em>However,</em> and this is a big however, he should be playing a wiley trickster and using the game mechanics to support that play.  He should not <em>be</em> a wiley trickster at the table, using and abusing social relationships (I trust my friend not to screw me with tricky wording while we play a game for entertainment) to get his way.<br/><br/>So, in short: (a) talk to your players, and (b) use the game system to support play.                        </div>

<br/>
Everybody is trying to be nice by sympathizing with your belief that this is an immensely complex situation.<br/>
<br/>
But, really, it's not.<br/>
<br/>
G's player made a bone-headed move.  He's gleefully happy about his bone-headed move.  This is where the role of GM as referee is both liberating and painful.  Your judgment doesn't depend on how gleeful G's player is about his supposed cleverness.  You need to make your judgment based on what you think should happen.<br/>
<br/>
You clearly think that G should be held to the spirit of the deal, and so do I.  It makes for a much better story.  It also happens to be a pretty sensible "What <b>would</b> happen" sort of judgment.  And it's fair to F, not holding him to an "examine every syllable for loopholes" level of totally unfun gameplay.  It's <i>the right decision</i>.<br/>
<br/>
So you make it happen.  G tries to escape at the front gate and he <b>can't</b>.  That's your judgment, you deliver it, you continue the game.<br/>
<br/>
G's going to be upset, and he's likely to rules-lawyer (as, indeed, he's already doing in preparation) and that's when you tell him "Man, you took a big gamble with powerful magic you <b>do not understand</b>.  That's gutsy.  You got bit in the ass this time.  That's the risk you take when you make a gutsy move.  Suck it up and move on."<br/>
<br/>
By revealing his little plan to you in advance, G is trying to buy himself a little insurance.  He's making sure that you consider his side of the argument all week long, and agonize over it, and (he hopes) come around to his side.  I'm a person who generally has a very optimistic view about human behavior, but his attempt to get you on his side is so utterly <b>transparent</b> that even I can't see any sensible reason for it that doesn't boil down to social bullying.  Your job is to hang tough, to make a judgment based on the relevant factors, and to stick with it.                        </div>

                            Chewing on this a little more, I have to ask this:  Is the player being a jerk or is the character doing something the character would normally do?  (And in the case of both, which one is the trump for you?)  The answer to that tells you if you should handle this as a player-GM talk or in the game.  Either way, you might want to let everyone know that as a GM you don't really like that sort of play style and that next time if they must do something like that to talk with you <i>beforehand</i>.<br><br>I've seen this before (and done a little of this myself), and in many of the cases I've seen, it was the character's natural action more than the player being a jerk.  Maybe I assumed too much here.  The last Unknown Armies game was filled with this kind of behavior from the characters -- to the point where half the PCs became the antagonists of the game -- but on the guys-around-the-table level everyone was having fun and no one was trying to be a jerk to one another (aside from a couple cases I nipped in the bud quickly).                        </br></br></div>

                            Thanks for the replies, everyone.<br><br>Regarding "Talk it out": Here's the bind I'm in. Shorn of the RPG context, the situation is, person A came to me and told me something that he's doing/going to do to person B, and said "Shh! Don't tell him!" Now if I have a group pow-wow, I'm betraying the confidence of person A, who wanted things on the down-low. Which is, y'know, perfectly acceptable, if I feel person B has a right to know. That's the call I've got to make. If it was real-life victimization--easy. It's game victimization, so. . .trickier.<br><br>Brand: I'm totally with you, if it was "ha-ha, watch me try to trick your character!" I'd be all for it, when it's "Psst! Don't tell so-and-so, I'm tricking his character, not so much. Unless we were playing that kind of game, which we're not. And it seems to me that the very nature of this trickery relies on fooling the player: "watch me sucker him in, then totally betray his expectations!"<br><br>Regarding "how do Winds of Change wagers work, exactly?": it's left largely to the reader, as I recall. Sadly, I've moved recently and I can't seem to dig up my OtE book, so I'm running on memory. I'm inclined to think that Chikutorpl (The Casino mistress) enforces the bets personally, but I think that's just my instinct/preference, not anything textual. Which is fine, OtE leaves some things like that vague for a reason. I've just never had to think about this before since nobody's tried to work the system.<br/><br/>Ryan: I guess my answer is both, though the latter often seems like an excuse for the former with this guy. He tends to skirt along the edge of plausible deniability with vehicle-for-disruption characters. This whole thing started out rip-roaring fun, with a whole bunch of wicked grins across the room and "you're hunting me? Awesome!" And now this. There's a pretty grey area about inter-player subterfuge since OtE is partially a game of keeping secrets from each other. But it seems to me that the guy is taking advantage of everyone else's cards being clearly on the talbe by holding his close to the vest.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aaaand Tony: You make a good point, man. I guess the reason i'm presenting it as complicatate is, it's <i>simple</i>, but messy. Like, on the we're all friends but so and so is doing X to so and so and I'm caught in the middle, level. Which you''re aware of, of course.<br/><br/>But, y'know, you're right, I <i>know</i> that it's the way it should go down. "Hang tough" is a good way to put it. I gotta bite the bullet and make a call that may cause some unpleasantness at the table. If G's player hadn't come to me in advance, we'd be having the ugly moment on the spot with no preparation, as he says "I bolt," and I'm like "um, NO," and he's like "but listen, the <i>careful wording!</i>" and I'm like "Whaaa. . .?" At least this way, I know it's coming, and can like, compose myself. Useful.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's that. Anyone feel free to reply or offer whatever observations, but unless convinced otherwise, I'm thinking Tony nailed it. Thanks!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS: As far as having a group talk about what i like and don't like in the game, as a couple people, brought up: that's definitely a good idea. I've had trouble with this in the past because I find it hard to express in words just what I'm looking for from OTE. I talked to everybody awhile back about flags, bangs, and scene framing, which has helped things a lot (and particularly wrt Flags, has brought MY end of the game fun much more up to snuff), but some of the traditional attitudes about, say, secrets between players, are touch nuts to crack. I'll give it thought.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Storywise, I think the most interesting solution is: he bolts, and this seems to work... but then he gets a mysterious delivery: a calling card with a symbol he recognizes as the mistress of the casino (or whatever would be appropriate.) No explanation, yet. Let it turn into something interesting.</p>
<p>The in-game rationale being:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>The Winds of Change is a roving casino run by an otherdimensional hostess, at which people gamble for the ultimate stakes--life&amp;death, age, beauty, happiness, heart's desires.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Assuming that's literally true, I can't see "whether I walk with this guy to the edge of someone's estate" as being an ultimate stake. The hostess would only allow the wager if it really mattered for both parties.</p>

<p>I'd just like to add my voice to those already raised in this manner:</p>
<p>Players tricking players is cool if we're in Gamist play, where showing each other up and getting props for it is the reason we do it. It sounds like exactly one of your players is playing that way, though.</p>
<p>Consider: I'm playing a game that takes place in the court of Queen Elizabeth I. In the fiction, the Spanish ambassador fools Her Majesty's top advisor into talking her into marrying King Phillip of Spain.</p>
<p>If we're playing in Gamist fashion, I'm showing everyone that I can trick someone; maybe I've lied, or maybe I've used my resources in a clever way so that the advisor thinks that he'll get something that he won't. If the advisor is a protagonist, this likely means that the ambassador's player has some hidden information that the advisor can't see.</p>
<p>If we're playing in Narrativist fashion, though, it's more profitable to tell the players what's going on all the time. That way they can fuck their characters over real good. Making a deal that turns south is great story fodder. Make sure everyone can support that story as you're building it.</p>
<p>What you have here is a clash of Creative Agendas. It might be a short-term problem. But I suggest that you talk with the player who confided in you and say, "Listen, you can either take the deal in the spirit of the agreement, or we can discuss it in the open; we're not tricking each other here."</p>

I'd say that It's not that he has a right to know: it's that the issue needs to be discussed.<br/><br/>Gaelinar's player hasn't done anything wrong (and he's not, I think, abusing any social relationships). He's playing in a tricksy, backstabbing style. That's how he likes to play.<br/><br/>The question is whether the <i>group</i> likes that style of play. It's entirely possible they do: and Frank's player will say "Damn! You're right, that was the exact wording. Nice job.". But it's very possible they don't.<br/><br/>In other words, it's a social contract issue.<br/><br/>So I agree: you do need to sit the group down and say "This is what's happened. Do we want to allow that kind of thing?". And I think you need to leave the GM hat behind during that discussion, because no-one's expecting you to rule on how everyone should play.<br/><br/>(Oh, and I like Joshua Newman's take on it, above).<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Hmm, <br/>
<br/>
You could always have one of Compton's minions meet the two of them part way on their walk. "The master is in his Astral Manse this evening." And leads them through a doorway to the astral plane. <br/>
<br/>
Its a way to make the decision of whether to exploit the loop-hole interesting. Argueably Compton set things up this way by having an agent overhear things. He gets the best of both worlds. Frank fails to complete his side of the bargain, and he can always send someone to get Gael as he wanders around lost in the astral. It gets both peeved at Compton, which might even help the story along.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But you should also talk to your players. It seems likely there will be hurt feelings from this no matter what, better to make them quick and less connected with play. <br/>

                            OK, a lot of new input. Let me try to process and pull it all together:

Man, that is slick as snot. How can I resist using it? Though I almost feel guilty, in a plagiaristic way.<br/><br/>Josh (ACN), your diagnosis of Agenda clash rings true. I have been trying to talk to players more in the last several months of playing, to promote greater understanding and being on the same page, but it's still a bumpy ride. In this case, it still seems to me that the clashis <i>deliberate</i> on G's player's part, that he knows, roughly, what game is being played, and is subverting that.<br/><br/>Graham, agreed on the "sit down and talk" necessity. I'm kinda torn on when and how though. If I just expose the issue to the group, then G's player gets gypped, if I don't, everyone else possibly does, mostly F. ("I'd like to talk as a group about our preference of secretive vs. out-in-the-open play. For instance, G, here, is playing secretively and hatching a devious plan against F. . .")<br/><br/>On that note, Mike has a good point about approaching G separately.<br/><br/>Mendel, that's also a beautiful and elegant in-character solution. Actually, Compton <i>does</i> have a minion lurking about the Casino for other purposes. I didn't set it up that way, swear to God. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I've considered using that in some manner, whether he accompanies G and F back to the manor, or informs Compton of what went down, or what.<br/><br/>S0. Let's look at it this way: the problem exists along two axes, Player and Character. I can solve it any which way along those axes. If i deal with it entirely at the player level, that precludes the option of an elegant in-game solution, like several suggested. Which would be a shame. If I merely let things proceed and make my call, the possible hurt feelings will burn all the hotter for coming right at the crisis moment in the story. I like Tony's way because it's nice and direct, and manages to deel with the hurt feelings issue matter-of-factly and immediately. The "Chikutorpl's calling card" solution is more devious and slick, and doesn't stomp on the player's toes yet lets him know there are consequences to his choice. But it lacks immediacy, which means leaving F's player hanging while Wierd Justice draws G back into the web he's woven for himself. The "Compton's minion" solution in whatever form, as well as the "Chik makes everyone reiterate the stakes" idea, make perfect sense but carry the feeling of the GM using NPCs as a club.<br/><br/>Oh, and i almost forgot the "make him roll for it" option. There've been two suggested: roll against the "Wierd Casino Magic" power to subvert its strictures, or roll agains the PC to try to fool him. I'm leaning toward the PC on PC roll, but that's if I decide to run it that way at all. Doing so would preclude a lot of the cool solutions above, plus it makes F's character roll twice to get what he wants.<br/><br/>Which brings me to a follow-up question: any thoughts on making the gambling itself interesting? This has always been a problem for me when running the WoC; while I love it in concept, it's hard to come up with a way to play the gambling conflicts that doesn't ultimately come down to flipping a coin. I've thought of pulling out actual cards and playing a hand of poker or whatever, which i'll probably at least have on hand so the players can take that option. Any other thoughts? Ican always have them roll relevant traits, but OtE is pretty simple and the traits are right around in the same range so it's not much different from a 50/50 chance there, either. As far as what games to play, the WoC encompasses all standard games of chance plus whatever odd arrangements participants cancome up with. Unfortunately, I've never been good at coming up with interesting alternatives.                        </div>

                            Actually, the talk about it as a group doesn't preclude the slick IC answers. If the group says "surprise us IC" or "well, we want to do something with it IC and then not do it like that in the future" then you can totally do one of the above excellent suggestions. <br/><br/>As for gambling, if you want the gambling itself to be the tension point, then as JD says: sure LARP it. Play the gambling. If you want to have character skill level play a part, make a mini-system where there is a roll of whatever gambling related skills being used, and whoever wins gets some advantage in the actual gambling. Like, getting to see one card from the communal cards if you're doing Texas Hold'Em (or getting to see one of the hole cards on a critical), or getting to bet on a slightly wider spread if doing roulette, or whatever. <br/><br/>OTOH, sometimes that comes off gimiky or not to CA. A lot of times the stress isn't in the hand, its in the pot (the stakes) and so the tension is in the getting screwed afterwards. In that case don't linger on the gambling, resolve it at normal pace and then move on to the getting screwed afterwards.                        </div>

                            A lot of good advice here.<br/>
<br/>
In game solutions will not change the initial problem however.  G's player has manuvered you into a spot where you with have real conflict with him or real conflict with the other players.  Not to mention the real conflict you are having with yourself about fairness, and being a GM.<br/>
<br/>
There are dozens of Ingame solutions.  But ingame soltions are just creative duct tape for your problem.<br/>
<br/>
You seem like a person who doesn't like conflict.  Facing an open discussion with your group is a conflict.  have that conflict once, or have G's Player manuver you into this kind of conflict over and over.  <br/>

<p>Josh (ACN), your diagnosis of Agenda clash rings true. I have been trying to talk to players more in the last several months of playing, to promote greater understanding and being on the same page, but it's still a bumpy ride. In this case, it still seems to me that the clashis deliberate on G's player's part, that he knows, roughly, what game is being played, and is subverting that.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>In my experience, most refusal to address agenda clashes and mechanical conflict resolution is to enable cheating by using social pressure.</p>
<p>I agree with Kat. This is a social problem that has to be dealt with socially. The game itself is irrelevant. G's player has violated social contract (if only in a little way) and is making you complicit.</p>
<p>At its core, though, the problem is a misunderstanding: this isn't how conflict resolution works. G's player has set things up so his character can't fail. He's set it up so that, if he wins, something happens, and if he loses, nothing happens. That's the worst kind of stakes setting possible. Now, I'm not overly familiar with OtE, but I don't <em>think</em> character failure costs the player resources, does it? So what's he risking if he has real stakes? Some character conflict?</p>
<p>It sounds like his losing stakes are, "If I lose, I try to cheat my way out of the agreement and I get caught."</p>

                            You've got a good point, Kat. Whatever happens, I want to get things settled once and for all so this doesn't keep coming backagain and again.<br/><br/>As for not liking conflict, no, I don't. Actually I'm not one of those people who retreats or folds up under pressure; more like I explode and things get messy. So I find it better to rein myself in, and when possible be prepared and composed to tackle a conflict I must face. So in a way agonizing for a week is a good thing. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Good call, Josh on the misunderstanding issue. And now that I think about it, while I did sit down with some members and <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=20222.0" rel="nofollow">talk over changes in direction for the game</a>, and briefed others as opportunity arose, G's attendance has been sporadic for awhile, and I may have missed filling him in on some playstyle issues.<br/><br/>The road away from "you lose, nothing happens" has been a rocky one, the previous group expectation has been the "you try to pick the lock,you fail, try again next round" mentality. And coming from that background, it's sometimes hard for me to think of good and interesting failure consequences. In this instance, though, with its PC-vs-PC nature, it's clear to all parties that the deal has <i>on its face</i> success <i>and</i> failure condition for both parties. There's only so much ignorance G can claim.<br/><br/>Anyway, it'll resolve for good or ill tonight. Wish me luck!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>EDIT: No, no character resources unless he's in combat or using a wierd power (HP and power usages, respectively).                        </div>

                            Well, things went a little unexplectedly last night. I was debating whether to have a pre-game talk about things, but G's player arrived somewhat late, and everyone was itching to start, so I just plunged in. I was leaning toward the TonyLB solution, with a dose of "Chikutorpl comes and reiterates the stakes," but was prepared to improvise.<br/><br/>But the world will never know what might've been, 'cause Frank lost the conflict.<br/><br/>So sorry, I have no hard data to report on resolving the difficulty. I <i>do</i> want to have a brief group talk at the beginning of next week's session, to clear things up about stake-setting, players secrecy, and the like(both state my preference <i>and</i> solicit the players'). I wanna get things out in the open without being confrontational and singling out a player. That'll be the most positive thing for the group <i>and</i> give me more of a leg to stand on if a problem does persist, to take the offender aside and go, "<i>Dude.</i>"<br/><br/>Something interesting <i>did</i> happen, though, which is relevant to the topic. As I said, Frank lost and now owed gaelinar a favor, a "job" to be specified at a later time. I mentioned to F's player, "you know. . .Nickels [the Satanist ghost possessing Frank] <i>really </i>hates Gaelinar." I did it just as a reminder that his character's possessed, and to see what he'd do with it. So the player had Nickels come to the surface and take over, and he got in Gaelinar's face. Pretty soon <i>they'd</i> agreed to a wager: in either case Nickels is freed from Frank's body--G gets his soul in a jar if G wins, and G has to provide Nickels a new body (live or dead) if Nickels wins. They played, and Nickels won! Gaelinar owed him a body.<br/><br/>Gaelinar said, addressing Frank, "OK, I've got a job for you. Find me a body for Nickels. . .and make sure it's at least 80 years old."<br/><br/>Well, that brought the house down. The group (including F's player) showered G with fanmail/gift dice (a mechanic I bolted on to OtE) as soon as their jaws were scraped off the floor.<br/><br/>This was really interesting as it provided a perfect counterexample to the problem case. First of all, it really was genuinely slick, and thus upgraded from lame to awesome right there. Second, it was all above-board and out in the open for everyone's participation/appreciation, as opposed to the sleazy back-room deal of last week. And third, it was entirely fair: Frank walked right into it, every step of the way, and there were no hard feelings.<br/><br/>It's amazing to me that these two examples originate from the same player. My previous experience with the guy hadn't led me to be terribly optimistic aboout last night's outcome. But he really came through with awesome play that engaged people and jazzed up the whole game. My best explanation is, it's just a matter of his trickery-agenda working fine when it's out in the open and engaging the group system, not circumventing it. And I don't think the fact that this contribution was sucn an increase in <i>quality</i> hurt either. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So there it is. All's wel that ends well, and Ihope to get the mode of play ambiguity cleared up soon. Things are looking pretty good.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel<br/><br/>PS: Interestingly, G showed up this week with his own deck of cards for use in the wagering. Frank's player declined to use them, preferring a straight dice roll, on the grounds that if he played a card game it would be his skill and not his character's that won the day. Odd.                        </div>
