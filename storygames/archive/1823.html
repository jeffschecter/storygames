<p>So, like, the title <strong>Spirit of the Season</strong> just popped into my head and I was like <em>of course</em> I should run a game for Christmas. Where Father Christmas is a mad scientist who wants to send all the children to Mars to get them away from the increasingly dangerous and corrupt Earth. Or something.</p>
<p>And obviously, in the grand tradition of running games named snowclonewise after their systems, it should be run in SotC.</p>
<p>But I don't really know the Fate system, and I'm not really confident that I want to pick up a game that I'll probably play like, twice, for like thirty bucks, and all that for a <em>pun.</em> Is it something I can really get my money's worth?</p>
<p>For me, "my money's worth" means at least one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can run it in person at the drop of a hat, and there is minimal book-sharing and book-reference required. No one else needs to know the game. <em>1001 Nights</em> is a model game of this style; I don't think I even <em>can</em> forget its system, it's so tight.</li>
<li>With minimal prep and explaining, I can run a pickup game on IRC, which means, among other gamers who probably have no access to the book at all. Or I can point them to a functional Web reference.</li>
</ul>
<p>and definitely this:</p>
<ul>
<li>One-shots are cool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is SotC the game for me? Or should I do something monstrous with DRYH?</p>

                            Well, I can vouch for cool one-shots run with no book-sharing or book-reference, because that's what John Harper ran for our group a couple Tuesdays ago. Actually we did use minimal book-reference - PDF-reference, actually - when making up the characters, just reading over the main skills and stuff for the characters we were devising, but otherwise, it ran smoothly and well even though only John, I believe, had actually read through the PDF.                        </div>

                            The biggest single problem with keeping _all_ of SotC in your head is the stunts, but more broadly, there's a weird ethos to it that makes that hard.  The idea is that you can keep all the rules you'll need for a game in your head, but which set of rules that is can vary from game to game.<br/><br/>Basically, the skill and stunt writeups are a very wide selection of data, but you only really need to go deep on the skills that your players are leaning on as schtick, and the stunts, for the most part, are simple enough that the player can track the ones he has and call it a day (at least for rules purposes - the GM should keep track in terms of what stuff to throw at players, but that's easier).<br/><br/>That said, SOTC does require some ramp up before it all falls into place, and that is probably where it breaks down for you, specifically with the IRC component.  The necessity for book sharing is small, but it does exist, and I would worry about the logistics of exposing a group to it blind. I think if you _already knew_ SOTC, it would suit your needs perfectly, but given the criterea you list, I hinge it on whether you want to do chargen or use pregens.  If you want to do chargen, I don't think SotC will suit your needs.  If you are using Pregens, most of the overhead goes away, and what remains can be communicated easily.<br/><br/>(And as a note, we've got PDF only up for sale now, if that helps with the curiosity).<br/><br/>Anyway, sounds like a fun idea.  Good luck with it.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

<p>Rob, thanks for that. Can you tell me a little more about stunts? Are these analogous to feats in d20 or Charms in Exalted, localised exception-rules that are particular to characters?</p>

<p>This actually sounds very promising to me. It's good to know that, if I use pregens, which I might with the sort of game that I am thinking of, it could work well.</p>
<p>So, I guess I'll wait for the dead-trees version to be back. You have an ETA?</p>

                            Stunts are in the same sort of thought-space as  charms &amp; feats.  We actually went for a big explicit list rather than a smaller ruleset for creating them generically to try to explicitly catch some of the same things that makes feats charms and spells appealing to players, but it's definitely a double edged sword.<br/><br/>(Oh, and I was unclear! We've still got print copies for sale, but we've also added an "I only want the pdf" option, for those so inclined.)<br/><br/>Let me elaborate a bit on what I mean, so you can determine whether it suits your need.<br/><br/>While stunts are fun, the real bulk of the game lies in the handling of skills, which we think we do a little oddly.  Each skill is written up so that if that skill is your schtick (or one of your schticks) then it's _cool_, even if you never touch the stunts.  This produced some unique challenges.  It's easy to make a guy whose apex skill is in Guns cool - it takes more work for the guy whose apex skill is Academics or another less-adventurey skill.  Net result? We end up writing a whole lot of  stuff about the cool things you can do with academics and how to make academics relevant and useful in play.<br/><br/>Now, this means that whatever skill a player decides is most important is going to be fun and cool to play, but that also means that if you try to read and absorb all the skills for every game, it might get daunting.<br/><br/>So practically speaking, you really only need to _use_ this information for, say 1-3 skills per player, and much of that information can be in the hands of those players as well.  And at that scale, it's not too daunting.<br/><br/>Oh, it's also worth noting that there is a middle ground between an involved character creation and pregens.  We support on-the-fly character creation through play, somewhat like in Heroquest, and it's proponents are enthusiastic enough that I feel it probably deserves some mention.  The one mechanical difficulty with it was picking stunts, since those aren't easy to do on the fly, so Fred cranked out a magnificent set of "quick picks" - pre-selected packages of stunts -  to cover a huge range of potential character ideas with minimal ramp-up.<br/><br/>That help any?<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Rob nailed all that needed to be nailed.  Glad it's looking like a buy, Shreyas!<br/><br/>I might footnote it all with: I like to think that while SOTC might not be for everyone, there's a lot of stuff in it that folks can grab and use in the stuff they DO play regularly.                        </div>

                            let me add that the write up of skills-from-players-view, skills-from-GM-view, skill-related-stunts with the cross referencing makes using the book really easy. Oh, and the eight page index that didn't show holes during my first game, too.                        </div>
