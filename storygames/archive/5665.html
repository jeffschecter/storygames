This prize took the form of commitment by members, offering something to the winner. Examples include art, playtesting, graphic design, editing, web hosting, etc.<br/><br/>The forum is still new and has few members. The results however were really impressive.<br/><br/>Eleven games were being developed, and eight were finished.<br/>Here\xb4s a quick summary of the games.<br/><br/>- Agua (Water) by J: This game is set in a fictitious world made of ice. The players are foreigners, aliens with the strange power to find "water." A terrible war wages the setting and water is precious. The characters are made of their relationships, and use them for their own purposes. It has a very clever system where relationships are gained, spent, taken advantage of, etc. An excellent game.<br/><br/>- Determinante Cero (Determinant Zero) by Cutrix: A game about very special students on their final stretch to becoming famous scientists. They fight useless bureocracy, a student\xb4s center that\xb4s all about politics, and of course each other. The game uses a 2x2 matrix representing the students "soul/brains," "chaos/order" as a resolution system. The idea is to maintain the Determinant Zero, otherwise the student cracks. It uses a calculator to do this. The text is written in true Paranoia tradition and can even be played without a GM. In the end it\xb4s all about letting everyone know that the education system in Argentina is screwed, and we need to do something about it. Pure genious.<br/><br/>- e\xd1e by myself: This is a small game, written in about 7 hours on the last day of the contest. It\xb4s about the letter \xf1. This strange letter is responsible for a worldwide violence explosion including civil wars, invasions and cultural revolutions. The players are a young generation of "sorcerers" that can use words to determine reality. The game is GM-less and uses a one die and word based system that uses the letter \xf1 as a basic element.  <br/><br/>- La Invasi\xf3n Atalant\xe9 (The Atlantean Invasion) by Zonk.PJ: This game takes us to 1000BC in pre Roman Iberia. The Atlantean race has the ability to see the future and they learn that mankind is going to destroy itself. The Atlanteans plan invasion and the characters have to defend their land. It uses a variation of FUDGE with some specific mechanics developed for the game.<br/><br/>- Maldici\xf3n de Sangre (Blood Curse) by Nightwalker: This game is about family drama. Some people discover they carry ancient curses on their blood from their european forefathers. This people get together to discover the beginning of the curse and fight it, jumping between past and present. The game uses a simple dice pools system and a very interesting changing GM mechanic.<br/><br/>- M\xedo Cid by elmago79: In this game the players are Spanish (or Moor) soldiers from the american conquest. They (the soldiers) tell stories about their deeds in the recent past. The game is GM-less, competitive and uses a Spanish deck of cards for resolution. A true storytelling game.<br/><br/>- Rapanui by Ivers0n: This game is about the Easter Island during the Cold War. Turmoil is all around and a strange discovery is made regarding the island\xb4s moais. The Chile soccer world cup and the Cuban missile affair are all part of the setting. The players are natives of the island that can commune with animal spirits from the island. The game uses a "Shadow of Yesterday lite" hack.<br/><br/>- The Furious by Ryback: This game is set in Spain in the seventees. Superheroes are real and are out of control. The players play members of La Guardia, a bunch of crazy bastards with powers or genetically enhanced abilities in charge of controlling the superdudes. It uses a Spanish language generic system called C-System.<br/><br/>The games will be tuned and improved in the workshop of the forum and I\xb4m guessing more than a few will be played a lot during this year.<br/><br/>Cheers!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thor" title="thor"><img alt="thor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/thorhansen/Pictures?authkey=Gv1sRgCKPylM61jtOQbA#5529849930194336866"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thor">thor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126733/#Comment_126733" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T03:50:34+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  3:50AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Congratulations one and all.

Who doesn\xb4t want to blow his own horn?<br/>I was not participating in the contest and was limiting myself to the moderation and taking care everything ran smoothly (I am SAS\xb4s administrator)<br/>However on Friday, talking with anoter member I was thinking about the letter \xd1 which clearly diferentiates our culture from all others. I was already playing around with the contest\xb4s words as "atributes" for character somehow.<br/>So, I came up with a weird story about how the introduction of the letter e\xf1e in url addresses (this will happen this year for .es domains) ended in global war and cultural evolution. The playes are se\xf1eros, a kind of "sorcerer" that can determine things by using the right words on their sentences.<br/><br/>I set the three basic attributes for the characters:<br/>Sa\xf1a (means fury, anger) is the physical aptitude of the characters.<br/>Ma\xf1a (dexterity, aptitude, wisdom) is used to get stuff from others by non violent means.<br/>Cala\xf1a (someone\xb4s "type" or nature) is the actual power that the se\xf1eros (the players\xb4 characters) have.<br/><br/>The have four characteristics:<br/>The concept: pretty much what you all know about a character\xb4s concept. In this game it\xb4s somewhat important to set the nationality of the character.<br/>The impulse: this is an event that takes place inmediately before game starts and gets the player going. This will define his...<br/>The ways: this are one line descriptors of the characters objectives. He has three ways and if he completes one (succesfully or not) he gets experience points (puntos de desempe\xf1o) and has to develop another way to transit.<br/>The potencies: this are the three attributes mentioned above.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns, one player with his character, the one on the right playing all the opposition (using the characters ways and impulse as guides) pretty much like you do in Shock:<br/><br/>Whenever the character and the opposition are in a situation without clear solution we use the resolution system.<br/>If the character is using his Sa\xf1a or his Ma\xf1a, the opponent rolls a d6. If the result is equal or lower than the attribute, the conflict is won by the player. <br/>This scores do not change during gameplay (but can be increased with experience points)<br/><br/>When using his Cala\xf1a, the d6 roll indicates the amount of letter e\xf1e the player must include in his description of the scene. If the opponent rolls a 3, the player needs to use three words with the letter e\xf1e while describing his solution. If the roll is four or more the player can use a word with the e\xf1e pronunciation, even though the word does not include the actual letter (ge<b>nio</b>, <b>nie</b>ve)<br/>However, the player can spend some of his Cala\xf1a points to lower the number of required e\xf1es.<br/><br/>And that\xb4s pretty much it. It was done in a rush and I hope I will be able to expand it a little bit and use the excellent feedback I\xb4ve been getting in the forum.<br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clinton R.
