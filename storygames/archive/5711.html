I'm looking for a game that will allow me to story game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appleseed_%28manga%29" rel="nofollow">Masumane Shirow's Appleseed</a>. Does such a thing exsist? I'm sure there must be a game that does this well, but I can't think of one. Specifically, I'm looking for a game that can handle a few different things, including:<br/><br/>Politics<br/>equipment fetishism<br/>complex police actions<br/>squad based combat<br/>exciting fire fights<br/>world building and shaping<br/>large casts of characters<br/>romance<br/>espionage<br/><br/><br/><br/>I can't quite think of a game that would allow me to do all these things. Or at least do all of them well. I could easily use two or three different systems and call it good, but I want something that really focus' on the strengths and themes of the subject. Does such a game exsist? Does anyone have a suggestion? Do I need to write this game in order to play it?<br/><br/>FYI, I'm talking about the manga, not the anime or the cgi film.<br/><br/><br/>Jake                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127585/#Comment_127585" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T09:04:52+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  9:04AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jake richmond</cite>Politics<br/>equipment fetishism<br/>complex police actions<br/>squad based combat<br/>exciting fire fights<br/>world building and shaping<br/>large casts of characters</blockquote>\n...sounds like Burning Empires.

As far as flavor, its closer to white wolf than D&amp;D. There are no "races" and you get a bonus for your profession, but no penalties. That is, a fighter can hack and be reasonably good, but a Hacker can do it better (he gets bonuses) and viced versa. And the bonuses aren't overwhelming, like a Solo (the gunfighter) gets a bonus to spot ambushes and initiative.<br/>\n  Compared to PTA, it is pretty crunchy.

Thanks.<br/><br/>Just for point of reference, my favorite Appleseed story is The Promethean Balance. This is volume 4, the volume long investigation that leads to the confrontation with the giant landmate and Deunan's 3 to 1 warehouse fight. The way the story is balanced between Duenan, Braireos, Fang, Bolt and Magus, with Lance, Morton, Pani, Sudo and other characters filling in the background as needed, is just really, really neat to me. This was the chief reason I originally thought PTA might work, and one of the reasons I've been wary of more traditional games like Cyberpunk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127612/#Comment_127612" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T10:19:08+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 10:19AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, Promethean Balance has that great exchange, "A little destroyer like you wasn't made for stake-outs," or somesuch.

Would actually be my recommendation before BESM, simply because the system is, IMO, a bit better. Great for the Gear, does ok firefights and would be easy enough to mod for some extra indieness in World-building, Situation- or character generation.<br/><br/>Alternatively, on could look into the ORE, which ATM is my go-to ystem for anything approaching ... not "realism" but the thin, crunchy crust of versimilitude that you see in things like, well, Appleseed. With Wild Talents, building your own [stuff] would be trivial, there is a free Mecha supplement available for it (Which might turn into a full-featured commercial game some day.) and there are also things like Cyberpunk or horror supplements, generally free, one could steal stuff from. It'd great for firefights, squad-combat and so on. And Reign, arguably the most modern incarnation of the ORE is a game anybody should have at home, IMO.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127631/#Comment_127631" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T10:59:16+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 10:59AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>What'd I'd do is use Cyberpunk and do some Ars Magica style character juggling, where everyone has primaries but there is also a shared pool of secondaries.</blockquote>\nMy group does troupe style pretty okay (not as well as my house group, unfortunately), so I think that will work fine.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Lord Minx</cite>Alternatively, on could look into the ORE</blockquote>\nNot finding it.

If you don't like a specific part, start a thread about it, chances are there's some ORE-Varant out there that changes it.

Torg 1.5 is available in hardcover.  Scrap the background, add your own gear fetishism, you're good to go.  Since <em>Appleseed</em> doesn't have magic you don't have to worry about Torg's magic rules.  The Nippon Tech sourcebook would probably help at least a bit in the gear department.<br/><br/>It has a scalable architecture so you can have humans, landmates, and those giant gun platforms all duking it out together, and it also handles one-on-many and many-on-one conflicts with a single roll.<br/><br/>If you like designing your own guns as much as Shirow does, then for nearly any system you should consider BTRC's <em>Guns, Guns, Guns 3rd edition</em> (3G3) so you can design your own boomsticks.  I don't know how well the <em>Vehicle Design System</em> handles landmates, but it alleges it can do anything from canoes to starships, so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128522/#Comment_128522" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T09:32:32+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  9:32AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Carl</cite>but it alleges it can do anything from canoes to starships, so.</blockquote>\nDamn, I always wanted a canoe designing game! thanks Carl, I'll add those to my shopping list.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
