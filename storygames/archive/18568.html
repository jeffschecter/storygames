RPG is nothing but a label, only good for marketing and starting stupid debates. It\u2019s too messy to make for good vocabulary. I personally expect an RPG to have players narrating a fiction and have that narration effect the systems of the game. Thats it, I expect narration to effect the game. i don't think it has to be the dominate feature, or even an equal one, it takes only a little yeast to ferment the whole loaf as the saying goes.<br/><br/>Narration implies a story and I bring this up because I want to talk about how stories twine with games. When narrated stories have four kinds of information: setting, plot, scenes and moments (SPSM). Setting is where a story happens, plots are why the story progresses, scenes are how things happen, and moments are the details of scenes. This taxonomy is useful for game design and this discussion, maybe not that useful if you are writing a book or script.<br/><br/>When I teach a game to a new player any game. it\u2019s best to tell them a very quick summary and then get to playing. The summary goes like this; how the game starts. The goal of playing and how you reach that goal. this translates to setting, plot, scene. <br/><br/>an example summary:<br/><br/>\u201cIn this game we are working together to save the world from deadly diseases. Each turn we act to stop the spread of disease and then the disease fights back.\u201d that covers the setting, plot, and scene structure of the board game Pandemic, the moment to moment action of of the game is then taught by demonstrating a turn or two before the new player has to act.*<br/><br/>Progressing from SPSM Is a logical way to build a story while you are telling it. knowing first where you are will clue you into what you want and how you are going to get it!  SPSM is the full spectrum of information players need to have when they narrate and it\u2019s supporting this full spectrum that is lacking in so many games! many games will support only a one or two types of information. some games are heavy with moment to moment action, some games generate a setting and plot and offer nothing for moments. <br/><br/>here are bar graphs rating how well various games support each type of information.**<br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/xEKczjF.png"/><br/>Fiasco<br/>\ufffc\ufffc<br/>Setting: Fiasco helps players establish a great setting, one of my friends described it as \u201csetting up a bunch of dominos and watching them fall\u201d. this is a great description because the momentum gained in the set up process drives the entire game.<br/><br/>Plot: the game guides player characters with needs and a scene structure that supports players in plotting out the game. it also has some nice plot level resolution mechanics in the turn and end rolls.<br/><br/>Scene: bare bones support for scene information but still does a good job of it.<br/><br/>moment: Fiasco gives you very little support when narrating moments. This can work brilliantly with the right players but can fall flat or vastly extend the game length if players don't have improvisational skills and a sense of timing. <br/><br/>Fiasco is one of the few RPG\u2019s that puts an average play time on it\u2019s cover and i have to say that while it does a good job of structuring the number of scenes and the overall ark of the story, if players average 5-10mins over the recommended play time per scene the game\u2019s total play time can double. a game with a stronger moment to moment system would have a much more reliable play time.<br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/bSFfDTQ.png"/><br/><br/>\ufffc\ufffcD20 here represents your standard three volume game. GM guide, Player Guide and Monster/setting book regardless of how the books are actually bound or collected. this does not include use of a story module <br/><br/>Setting: these games give you so much setting information you can pick and choose, hopefully your players know enough of it but not too much of it that what happens in the game breaks their perception of the setting. <br/><br/>Plot: These games give only hints and advice on what the plot of your particular game could be, in other words they don\u2019t support you here, you are on your own.<br/><br/>Scene: Very few formalized ideas of what scenes are but they do have initiative for fight scenes and that is a basic scene definition. In the typical dungeon build rooms can be thought of as discreet scenes.<br/><br/>Moment: Combat and skill challenges and skill checks are very strong mechanics for moment to moment narration. These games spend most of their play time in moment to moment scenes.<br/><br/><br/>\ufffc\ufffc<br/>Seed RPG 0Hunters<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i.imgur.com/cfvf0Pn.png"/><br/><br/>i have specifically engineered Seed to provide the SPSM in the amounts i want successful game. for specifics look in the index.<br/><br/>* I am not arguing that pandemic is an \u201crpg\u201d. i hope no one thought that.<br/><br/>** the graphs are not scientific, i could probably do a more in-depth study and count out rules and make a fair bar graph but this is a blog post not a book where i would have a publisher and an advance to live off of while i counted rules.<br/><br/>___________________\\<br/>that is the post so far. does it read well? what should i add?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417569/#Comment_417569" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-30T12:22:08+00:00" title="June 30, 2013 12:22PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 30, 2013 12:26PM by Rickard.">edited June 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm missing "meaning".

The later have come from players who found out that eventually, after a few games in the same setting with the same PCs and NPCs, "plot" somewhat grew of its own and was even better than just delving into dungeons without another goal except for the killing and looting.

A game like My Life with Master or Dogs in the Vineyard has a very strong moral theme or moral question which is central to the game (likely largely due to the way the Big Model and Forge ideas were formulated). This is one important aspect of a game, and can be more or less present in any game (it is entirely absent in a game like GURPS or Universalis, for example, but very heavily present in Montsegur 1244 or <i>nicotine girls</i>).<br/><br/>I'm curious why this model omits other obvious elements of RPG design and/or story construction?<br/><br/>For instance, Character is considered one of the important features of story (along with Plot and Setting). It seems to me that you could discuss "Character" in much the same way: here, a game like D&amp;D (or Dogs in the Vineyard) gives you a lot to work with, whereas Fiasco arguably gives you less, and something like Pandemic gives you nothing at all.

The last thing is not meaning. It's what you do, just like how you described D&amp;D. Meaning is not "theme" or what you do in the game. It could/should affect that. D&amp;D could have, when I think about it, a meaning that resolves around good/evil and law/chaos in it's alignment system but my opinion is that it's a really weak one. So I have to change my statement to "D&amp;D have almost no premise". <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> (I'm not using "meaning" in that sentence because it sounds even more dismissive than "premise".)\n<blockquote>Interesting.

To form situations around it. It all depends on how you handle it. I'm not certain what you mean with "narrate" because you put 100 % in D&amp;D when it comes to <i>moment</i>, but I feel it's the game that does the narrating there and not the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417699/#Comment_417699" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-03T07:15:17+00:00" title="July  3, 2013  7:15AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the premise of D&amp;D usually boils down to "let's have a good time by wrecking stuff up" or "fantasy romp".

Even the Alignment mechanic fails to actually produce it most of the time. Doesn't mean players who crave for meaning can't add it to the game, giving life to the most awesome moments we've ever witnessed in the hobby. <br/><br/>Playing a game with no meaning in it usually invites people to create it. Yes, you're adventurers and you go into dungeons and kill stuff. Why? Ok, at first just because it's fun seems to be a good reason, but after a few games in a setting you'll see that setting change. You have made impact in that world, and that creates a meaning in it. You'll probably have a good reason to kill the next group of orcs since now there's something in that world that not only matters to your character, it matters to you.<br/><br/>Now, adding <b>Meaning</b> into the premise of the game and build the rules around it actually makes this process faster. You'll probably care about the world and it's characters from the first scene, and probably earlier if you've made it an interesting premise for the players. You'll be playing a game with depth, facing moral issues in an emotional storm, changing the world faster and in more radical or subtle ways. Which is really cool, if that's the game experience you're after.<br/><br/>But, that's just my opinion, I'd also like to read what is <i>Meaning</i> for Carpe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417709/#Comment_417709" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-03T08:43:49+00:00" title="July  3, 2013  8:43AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think of narration as the process of player's being compelled to use words to progress the story and game.<br/><br/>I give high marks to D20 in moment to moment narration because skill checks and combat actions do a decent enough job of compelling players to say what they want to do (partially because the skills and abilities gave them the idea to do it) and the resolution gives the gm enough to narrate the effect of the player's intention.\n<blockquote><br/>For instance, Character is considered one of the important features of story (along with Plot and Setting).

Perhaps meaning doesn't affect the players? Perhaps meaning gives a goal for the player? Perhaps meaning affects the rest of the SPSM without being present while playing the game? It depends on the design of the game.<br/><br/>Another thing that could affect the narration is the group's relation. Does the player have high or low status in the group? Is there prestige to describe in a certain way? Is it common use to interrupt someone? Sadly, this is hardly ever  dealt with in roleplaying games, so it's probably outside your categorisation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417730/#Comment_417730" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-03T15:37:10+00:00" title="July  3, 2013  3:37PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2013 3:38PM by Paul_T.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Characters exist inside Settings, plots, scenes, and moments. in mouse guard character's have a belief, a goal, and an instinct. these break down cleanly into things that inspire narration and choices regarding that character's role in the setting, plot, scenes and moments. <br/></blockquote>\nI don't know if I buy this. (At least not yet!)<br/><br/>Characters are as important or more important to a game or a story than Settings and Plots. (And it's possible to design - or at least imagine - games and stories without scenes or without a Plot.) A story without Characters... it's quite arguable that this is impossible.<br/><br/>As a player in a game, I need to be able to "narrate" (which presumably includes making stuff up and making choices about what <i>not</i> to include) a variety of things, and Character is definitely part of that. Not only is it important to create or imagine characters to start with (to populate the story, or give a face to important forces in the plot), which is one separate step, and then imbue those roles with important thematic characteristics, or orient them in relation to Meaning. (Which is what archetypes are for/or result from.) For instance, certain types of characters need certain other characters to have a meaningful role in a story (it's hard to tell a traditional superhero narrative without including a villain, in other words).<br/><br/>Consider, for example, how a game like In a Wicked Age... gives us Characters but only implies a Setting.<br/><br/>And all this has very practical applications, as well. I've noticed that my gaming has gotten a lot better since I decided to focus more on Character and less on Setting (which traditionally a lot of RPG texts presented as a highly important aspect of the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417745/#Comment_417745" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-04T01:09:18+00:00" title="July  4, 2013  1:09AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I posted at first was about half of what I wanted to write. The second part is about how the SPSM order flips to MSPS for resolution. So moments resolve a scene. Secens resolve a plot and plots Change the setting. And that this loop structures into a play session with setting being the set up for a campaign and Plots being a single play session. <br/><br/>So I'm not talking about specific kinds on information but the context of information.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
