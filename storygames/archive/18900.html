This also is of interest, I think to JoshDemers' <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/18828/hero-world-a-superhero-hack-of-apocalypse-world" rel="nofollow"><b>[Hero World] A Superhero Hack of Apocalypse World</b></a>.  I am quite fond of Monster of the Week, and I think everyone who played in the Big Bad Con game quite enjoyed how it came out. Still, there are some problems I have with it. <br/><br/>Based on series like Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Supernatural, MotW tends towards more cinematic action than some other Apocalypse-powered games - meaning both there is both violent combat and that player characters are not expected to die. One nod that it makes toward this is Luck Points. I don't think these are a major problem because there are very few of them. (They never refill, and recharging one is an advanced improvement.) On the other hand, I don't find that they add to the game. Notably, they are a meta-game option in a game that otherwise tries to emphasize acting within the fiction. <br/><br/>Other cinematic action games - like Champions, Truth and Justice, or Spirit of the Century - usually have a quickly-refreshed damage. You recover your STUN or Stress damage after each combat automatically. However, switching to this in MotW would mean that combat rolls have much less consequence. So I'm pondering variants which would keep up major consequences while also keeping combat cinematic.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422785/#Comment_422785" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-12T21:50:46+00:00" title="October 12, 2013  9:50PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing to note is that cinematic doesn't mean that the heroes always win.

I think of MotW, which I'm also very fond of, as action-horror, and deliberately very unforgiving in combat. Its harm rules are far more deadly than in core AW, for example. And I think that's a genre-reinforcement mechanism, but the genre is emphatically *not* that of Buffy, despite the presence of the Chosen One class.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_422795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zedlopez" title="zedlopez"><img alt="zedlopez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zedlopez">zedlopez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422795/#Comment_422795" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T13:54:54+00:00" title="October 13, 2013  1:54PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good point. Much as I love MotW, the fairly routine need to pause mid-scenario for first aid usually isn't exciting and it's easy for the most obvious ways to try to make it more interesting to just feel like hoop-jumping (you need exotic ingredients for your healing spell! side-quest for everyone but the casualty, who's just benched in the meantime!) <br/><br/>Maybe some sort of collateral damage mechanic like in Strange Fate would be appropriate -- fights going badly tend to jeopardize innocents, or maybe expose the hunters to unwanted attention from the authorities, or unwanted involvement by NPCs. Or maybe up to the point of collapsing and needing emergency care, harm is less a measure of injuries needing treatment and more a measure what it will cost the characters to keep pushing themselves. (That one would be hard to make meaningful in a one-shot.)<br/><br/>It seems to me like healing scenes in the genre source-material tend to mostly be about the relationships, which are outside the scope of MotW's mechanics. It'd make for a different game with a different tone, but probably still a workable and interesting one to graft MonsterHearts' strings onto MotW. <br/><br/>Luck, I think, is a really interesting mechanic for those playbooks in which spending luck has side-effects like the Chosen, the Mad Scientist, the Summoned, or the Spooky. And it's not all that interesting in the others -- just a bit of ablative armor.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422803/#Comment_422803" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-13T16:28:25+00:00" title="October 13, 2013  4:28PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm thinking about healing conflicts in Dogs in the Vineyard.

In fact, I'd say that the time requirement is of the utmost importance here. If the hunters are stopping to get some rest and heal, the Keeper should absolutely be advancing the Countdown or making moves against the PCs who aren't directly dealing with them. So that Big Magic option might not be a bad idea...<br/><br/>Monster hunting is not safe business, after all. :-)<br/><br/>But yeah--MotW is a very rough, brutal game if you slug it out. The optimal approach is to research the blazes out of a monster so that you can take it down with the best skill possible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_422849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/422849/#Comment_422849" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-10-14T17:48:36+00:00" title="October 14, 2013  5:48PM">October 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'm thinking about healing conflicts in Dogs in the Vineyard.
