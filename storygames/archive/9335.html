So I backed way up and tried to find a good place to start, and I ended up four years ago, <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/archive/156.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>The one diagram and comment that really helped me understand this thing is this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/rpg/monopoly.gif"/><br/><br/>"Playing Monopoly, no arrows come rightward out of the fiction. Imagine whatever you want, nobody else cares."<br/><br/><i>Imagine whatever you want, nobody else cares.</i><br/><br/>In my own dumb way, that's what I was trying to get to with this diagram:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://roger.carbol.com/1Mhp/images/clouds_and_minds.png"/><br/><br/>Everyone's got their own little personal SIS.  They're imagining whatever they want.  Nobody else cares.<br/><br/>So... have I played an RPG like this?  Yep, I sure have:  D&amp;D 4th Edition.  Now, before everyone freaks out, let me assure you that I'm not claiming D&amp;D 4E <i>must</i> be played like this, or <i>should</i> be played like this, or anything of the sort.  I'm just claiming I've seen it happen.  Yes, I know saying this won't help at all.<br/><br/>I should probably throw out an example.  Here it is:  "I trip the snake.  I hit!  It's now prone."  Things like that happen in 4E all the time.  What does it mean within the fiction of the game?  Doesn't matter.  Imagine whatever you want.  Nobody else cares.<br/><br/>There's at least two ways the SIS and the Boxes can relate to each other.  "The map is not the territory" and "the map IS the territory."<br/><br/>In the D&amp;D 4E games I've played, the Battlemap IS the SIS.  If it's not on the Battlemap, it literally does not mechanically exist.<br/><br/>I should probably give a counter-example too.  My counter-example is the games I've played of Spirit of the Century.<br/><br/>The characters are in a location.  That location has Aspects, like Dark, or Cramped, or whatever, that carry mechanical weight.  "It's Dark, so it's -2 to hit me."<br/><br/>Here's something to think about:  How many Aspects does a location have?<br/><br/>The answer: an infinite number.  Bounded, to be sure, but literally infinite.  The deck of a pirate ship is Dark and Wet and Heaving, but it's also In Earth-Normal Gravity and Earth-Normal Oxygen Atmosphere and Moving Parallel to the Earth's Magnetic Field.  In any given instance of play, a few of the infinite Aspects will have an impact on play, and all the rest won't.  The map is not the territory, here.<br/><br/>In SotC, it behooves the players on a mechanical level to really Share the SIS.  It'd be really hard to play the game without it.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D 4E, there's no mechanical effects associated with the SIS.  Share it, or don't; it doesn't matter.  Imagine whatever you want.  Nobody else cares.<br/><br/>There was a nice bit of discussion in the podcast that was about, essentially, what happens if in the event of SIS Sharing failure.  "I take the high ground!"  "Uh, there is no high ground."  "Say what?"  Note that this conversation is entirely plausible with SotC, while it's highly implausible with D&amp;D 4E.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's been my little journey of understanding with respect to this stuff.  If it's helped, great.  If not, that's okay too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206909/#Comment_206909" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T12:03:10+00:00" title="May 12, 2009 12:03PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>Everyone's got their own little personal SIS.

I'm talking about the "and here's the 27 pages of character backstory I wrote all by myself that I'll now share with you" phenomenon that sometimes arises with a No Arrow Out of Fiction sort of game.  It's Shared in some sense, but not the sense that we normally use when we sit around and talk about the SIS.  So, good point.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>There's a broken bridge here? We strategize together about how to get our people across.

Whether that arrow goes over to The Boxes or back into The Cloud isn't entirely clear to me from you brief example, but there's a pretty good chance it gets to The Boxes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>I think that applies to most D&amp;D play, though, even when it's battlemap stuff.

Jesse brings up some excellent points so I need to address these first.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>Your SotC example and your D&amp;D example are exactly the same in terms of Vincent's diagram.</blockquote>\nBy the time this thread is over, I think I'll have reposted Vincent's entire original post.  Maybe I should have started with that; too late for it now.  In any case, here are some more diagrams from it:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/rpg/p2c.gif"/><br/><br/>This is an illustration of the rule "Subtract the roll on the damage die from your character's hit points."  I'd suggest it's also the illustration for a D&amp;D 4e rule like "When you hit with this power, the target is knocked prone."<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.lumpley.com/images/rpg/i2c.gif"/><br/><br/>This is an illustration of the rule "If your character has higher ground than his opponent, make your attack roll at +3."  I'd suggest it's also the illustration for a SotC rule like "After placing an Aspect on a target by using a Maneuver, you can tag it for free for a +2 bonus." \n<blockquote>The fact that the character is Prone absolutely matters to me because what tactic I follow up with might get a bonus or whatever.  The state of the fight matters.</blockquote>\nYeah, absolutely!  The interesting part for me of this is figuring out where this "state of the fight" exists.  In any RPG, some of it is going to be in The Cloud, and some of it is going to be in The Boxes.  The relative distribution matters, though, at least to me.\n<blockquote>It might as well have the Prone Aspect in SotC.</blockquote>\nAt that level, yeah, they are identical -- they're both mechanical effects at that point, sitting happily inside The Boxes.<br/><br/>The difference I see is this:<br/><br/>In D&amp;D 4E, every DM I've played with (and when I've DMed it myself) would allow a PC to use a power they have to knock a snake prone.  Disallowing it simply because snakes live on their bellies and have no legs would be highly irregular.<br/><br/>In SotC, every GM I've played with (and when I've GMed it myself) would resist a PC using a maneuver to give a snake the Prone Aspect, and resist an attempt to take advantage of that through tagging.  Allowing it despite the fact that snakes live on their bellies and have no legs would be highly irregular.<br/><br/>But, hey, that's just been my experience.  If you've seen counter-examples, I'd be really interested to hear them.\n<blockquote>I think your preferences are confusing the issue.</blockquote>\nAnd I'm going to start by derailing my own thread.  This is purely a tangent, but now I'm too curious to turn away.

A good example might be Milestones.\n<blockquote><cite>PHB, pg 259</cite>Milestones:  You gain certain benefits when you reach a milestone -- when you complete two encounters without stopping for an extended rest.  Each time you reach a milestone, you gain an action point.</blockquote>\nAnd from <a href="http://www.enworld.org/forum/4e-fan-creations-house-rules/244442-how-i-fixed-d-d-4th-edition.html" rel="nofollow">this thread</a>:\n<blockquote><cite>Rel</cite>Milestones - There are few mechanics in 4e that I find less flavorful than the "fight two encounters, get a Milestone" bit. But after consideration, I determined that what I needed to do is to simply turn Milestones into, well, milestones. In other words, have something meaningful actually take place. And it doesn't have to be after the encounter either. It can be smack dab in the middle of the battle.<br/><br/>If the PC's interrupt the Evil Wizards in the middle of their Ritual, that's a Milestone. If they maneuver past the Evil Cleric's minions and blow out the Dark Candles that have desecrated the Altar of Pelor, that's a Milestone. When they slay the Hobgoblin Lietenant who led the attack on their village, that's a Milestone. The PC's should constantly be setting short term goals and even quests. Accomplishing those is significant and earns Milestones (and therefore Action Points). Fighting a random encounter of wolves in the woods does not earn you a Milestone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Mearls - Lead Designer, RPG R&amp;D</cite>Interesting trivia bit: at one point, we thought about doing milestones pretty much the way you describe.<br/><br/>We decided against it because we figured that for story-based games, the DM would have a natural progression of scenes, while for a dungeon-based game it might be a pain to label some encounters as important and others as trivial.</blockquote>\nSo here we have a rule process based strictly over in The Boxes, someone proposing a house-rule that would result in a Right-Pointing-Arrow out of the Cloud, and one of the lead designers saying, yeah, we thought about doing that... but then decided not to.  Is this a better example than tripping snakes?  Maybe.<br/><br/><br/>While I'm here replying to people, I should clarify that I don't mean to claim that all D&amp;D 4E is all non-RPA all the time.  It has rules that are clearly RPAs.  I've had those rules come into effect during some of my actual play experiences.  I'm just saying the preponderance of my actual play experience with D&amp;D 4E hasn't involved any significant Right-Pointing Arrows.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_206974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/206974/#Comment_206974" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-12T16:35:41+00:00" title="May 12, 2009  4:35PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Roger,<br/><br/>I see the p. 42 DMG "stunt" table as all RPA, all the time.

Clearly your experience is different, and that's cool, I don't want to dispute that. I'm just curious what you think of the p. 42 thing, and how it informs this conversation, in your mind.</blockquote>\nIt's a good topic for discussion.  The first thing it impresses on me is that I've gotten lazy already with how I've been speaking about things, so it's high time I resolve that.  I've been implying the D&amp;D 4E game itself is non- or low-RPA, and that the SotC game itself is high-RPA.  That isn't really accurate.  It is individual rules themselves that are low- or high-RPA.  A game consists of rules, of course, so if most of the rules in a game are low-RPA, it's not too much of a stretch to call the game itself low-RPA.  But that's really just a discussion about the text sitting on a shelf.<br/><br/>As far as a game actually being played out in the real world goes, it may well be that the few high-RPA rules in a game are the ones getting all the use and doing all the heavy lifting, and the low-RPA rules are not factoring into it.  It's one of those distinctions that I really should have been more clear with from the beginning.<br/><br/>So, with all that out of the way, let's take a closer look at page 42.<br/><br/>The first sentence we have here is this:  "A few combat situations come up rarely enough that the rules for them intentionally aren't covered in the Player's Handbook."  The section heading for the remainder of this page is "Actions the Rules Don't Cover."<br/><br/>What I take away from that is the sense that this rules subsystem is intended for situations that rarely come up, and is a "second-class citizen" compared to the other rules.  If the 320 pages of PHB rules and 220 other pages of DMG rules don't cover a particular rare situation, then use this one page of rules.  I can appreciate that some groups are going to make much heavier use of it, but I'd suggest this is a Drift to some degree.<br/><br/>My own personal experience at the table has seen much less use of pg 42 than yours, so yeah, based on that alone, I'm inclined to think of the game as being pretty RPA light.  And also, as a result, it doesn't really inform my side of the conversation as much as it could.  But it's definitely among the Right-Pointing-Arrows in the D&amp;D 4E rules arsenal.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207092">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207092/#Comment_207092" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T10:08:30+00:00" title="May 13, 2009 10:08AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought of a few more things that I should talk about.<br/><br/>On the terminology front, I now think it's a mistake to think of The Cloud as "the fiction".  The fiction lives in The Cloud and also in The Boxes.  If I've got 25 out of 37 hitpoints, that's definitely part of the fiction and definitely in The Boxes.  It's all "the state of play", as Jesse has put it.<br/><br/>In practice, it seems to me that the relative sizes of The Cloud and The Boxes is closely related to the number of arrows coming out of them.  (But not, interestingly enough, to the number of arrows going into them.)  If lots and lots of arrows are coming out of The Cloud, making them RPAs, then generally one can conclude that most of the state of play is over in The Cloud.  If there's hardly any arrows coming out of The Cloud, then most of the state of play is over in The Boxes.<br/><br/>As Vincent alludes to when he talks about his old GURPS and Ars Magica games, what happens when there's not many arrows coming out of The Boxes is that The Boxes becomes an after-the-fact record of events.  I suspect that the symmetry holds: when there's not many Right-Pointing-Arrows coming out of The Cloud, then it tends to become an after-the-fact story of events.  I'm not entirely convinced with this line of thought, but it seems to be holding up for me sofar.<br/><br/><br/>I've been thinking of a couple of thought experiments that might also be useful to identify where the state of play is.<br/><br/>1.  The Substitute Player Thought Experiment.<br/><br/>The players are in the midst of play when suddenly one of them has to leave, and someone else, who is familiar with the ruleset but hasn't seen any of the game session so far, steps in as a substitute.<br/><br/>How much difficulty does he experience?  How much conversation is required to get him up to speed on the state of play?<br/><br/>In a game where most of the state of play is in The Boxes, he's got it pretty easy.  The state of play is there, in the concrete things that he can see and touch and read.  He's got his character sheet, his initiative order, he can see where his mini is on the map.  He might need to ask a few clarifying questions, but he might not need to do even that.<br/><br/>In a game where most of the state of play is in The Cloud, he's going to have a lot of troubles.  He'll need to ask a lot of questions -- where are we?  What are we doing?  Who else is here?  Who are THOSE guys?  Everything that was established in a conversation that he wasn't a part of, so it needs to happen again.<br/><br/><br/>2.  The Slithy Tove Thought Experiment.<br/><br/>The characters are sitting around when the GM announces "Suddenly, a slithy tove bursts in on you and attacks!"  The characters proceed to engage whatever conflict resolution system their game has, and emerge victorious.<br/><br/>Then the GM asks the players to individually sketch a picture of the unknown monster, based on their combat.<br/><br/>In a game where most of the state of play is in The Boxes, I'd expect the sketches to potentially vary pretty widely, on things like: how many legs did it have?  Was it humanoid?  What sort of eyes did it have?  What colour was it?  An outside observer considering all the sketches might not conclude that they're all of the same creature.<br/><br/>In a game where most of the state of play is in The Cloud, I'd expect to see less variation between sketches.  An outside observer considering all the sketches might well think they're all of the same creature.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_207102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan" title="Guy Srinivasan"><img alt="Guy Srinivasan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Guy%20Srinivasan">Guy Srinivasan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207102/#Comment_207102" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-13T10:59:20+00:00" title="May 13, 2009 10:59AM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roger, please note that you rock.

Case in point: I recently joined our last session late, dropped in mid-combat, asked those few clarifying questions, and just got to rocking with no troubles. In fact, I could have simply asked the GM where my fig entered, rolled my Initiative, and targeted an enemy mini. My main question, as the Cleric of the group, was, "Anybody seriously hurt?" I simply couldn't have dropped into any number of the hippie games I love so much and looked for Box cues to engage me. I certainly would have needed to be engaged by Cloud cues.<br/><br/>Not meaning to resurrect this thread, as I've already visited your reboot, but thought I'd post this here in response to this particular thought experiment.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_207494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/207494/#Comment_207494" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-14T21:26:57+00:00" title="May 14, 2009  9:26PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2009 9:27PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite>What I take away from that is the sense that this rules subsystem is intended for situations that rarely come up, and is a "second-class citizen" compared to the other rules.
