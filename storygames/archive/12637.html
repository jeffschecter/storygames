Not having the wherewithal to attend (and I still don't), I would pore over these lists and pick out the ones I wanted to play.  Today I did the same thing with the online listings and came up with a couple that I wish I was playing:\n<blockquote><b>The Ten-Blade Samurai</b> (Tenra Basho Zero)<br/><br/>Lord Kagetora's machinations for control of the Dragonscale Territories have consumed too many innocents, and his bloodshed must be put to an end. A Buddhist monk, a conniving geisha, a sleek mankiller robot, and a female warrior with a sword as long as her body stand against the tide of war. Experience the first ever English translation of this Hyper-Asian Japanese Role-Playing Game! New players, anime and manga fans welcome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><b>G.I. Joe Special Missions: Sierra Gordo</b> (Mutants &amp; Masterminds)<br/><br/>Summer 1988: General Hawk has discovered classified files on U.S. arms sales to the Middle East. The top brass have told him to look the other way, but that's not keeping him from sending in a team of Joes to check into the new counter revolutionary government of Sierra Gordo. Play as ANY of your favorite characters from 1982 - 1988 in this G.I. Joe Comic Series inspired adventure.</blockquote>\nI could list others, but those two really stuck out to me as things I'd really like to play.<br/><br/>Is anyone else like me?  Do you browse the listings and compose an imaginary schedule of games you'd play?  Or am I the only one who does this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
