If you look at how chaos magic lets you create and summon a servitor creature, or channel a supernatural being, you'll see that the only real difference between those procedures and the ones used in some games is one of intent. (The same can be said for writing novels or movie scripts, I suppose, but right now I'm talking about games).<br/><br/>In <a href="http://societyofdreamers.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Society of Dreamers</a>, I play with this idea a bit. The game isn't meant to be a magical ritual; it's a game <i>about</i> people using such rituals. Still, the first and last thing the players do in the game is to perform a ritual of banishing: Cleaning the room of evil spirits. This creates a feeling that something spooky is going on - and it helps people feel more comfortable about playing with ideas that, perhaps, border on the occult.<br/><br/>The game itself centers around revealing facts about the mnemosites - potentially supernatural creatures, found in dreams. The techniques used here could just as well be used by a group of chaos magicians to "create" such a creature. I don't really believe that's possible to do, I guess; but it struck me how easily the game can be transformed into a complex, immersive ritual of summoning.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277268/#Comment_277268" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T08:25:04+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  8:25AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This IS interesting. i remember that one of the first things that really blew me away when i discovered indie rpgs was the ritual structure of Polaris..                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277279/#Comment_277279" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T09:05:25+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  9:05AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Matthijs - this Society of Dreamers is appealing to me; I suspect I will order it even though I have far too many unplayed games right now.<br/><br/>I'm not certain I know what exactly you want from this topic, but games as rituals and rituals and ritual-like activities enhancing play experience is a subject of great interest to me.<br/><br/>Preparing game paraphernalia that is not strictly necessary for the game and laying them out on the table prior to the session often feels expressly ritualistic to me.<br/><br/>Sharing a meal with my fellow players before our Sunday games is a ritual and helps put me in a place where I can bring my best to the game.<br/><br/>I really like the salute in Beast Hunters and feel it adds something very important and tangible to the experience of play.<br/><br/>Polaris is one of my favorite games, in part for the rituals it employs and the phrases for Archipelago II and Love in the time of Sei\xf5 do something very similar for me.<br/><br/>The improv warm-up exercises where you stand in a circle, capture the gaze and then look intently into the eyes of your fellow performers and say "Yes"...<br/><br/>Even playing Cyberpunk twenty years ago I felt the pull of ritual in passing out and collecting bluebooks at the beginning and end of each session.<br/><br/>Role-playing games are magical for me and I welcome anything that recognizes and reflects on that in some way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277303/#Comment_277303" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T10:22:02+00:00" title="June 22, 2010 10:22AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played <i>Society of Dreamers</i> last Sunday.

In SoD, the players aren't expected (as with regular ouija boards) to wait until the planchette moves "by itself". Rather, they should give it a little shove to start it out, and then see where it goes. Which is pretty much the way scenes are played out - someone gives the scene a "shove", a starting direction; where it ends is completely up to the group. In both cases, players may choose to push in specific directions, or just follow more-or-less random pushes to see where things go.
