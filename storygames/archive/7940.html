If you release a book plus a couple of supplements you can profit in the $30k~$40k which isn't impossible to live with in the US. For people like me, living in a country with lower costs of living and with a weak currency, even $20k is a pretty good amount of money, it can pay the basics (rent, food, health insurance, transportation) and still leave some for cheap entertainment. It's not the consumer's paradise but if you want to live for art it's a decent deal.<br/><br/>I can see two major issues with this approach:\n<ol>\n<li>Actually finding and keeping, at least, one thousand true fans.</li>\n<li>Creating consistently good content, worth between $50~$100 for each fan, every year.</li>\n<li>Managing the sales of that content, as it's unlikely that the 1000 true fans will buy your stuff in the moment you release it.</li>\n</ol>\nAlso did anybody tried this path, actually living on art targeted to a specific group?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_175714">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175714/#Comment_175714" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-21T15:23:27+00:00" title="October 21, 2008  3:23PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Managing the sales of that content, as it's unlikely that the 1000 true fans will buy your stuff in the moment you release it.</blockquote>\nThis might be a tangent, but...<br/><br/>Who said it had to be "sold" in a standardised kind of way?<br/><br/>Let us imagine, if you will, that Greg Stolze (a person who lives not far from the 1000 fans model), was a bit more monetised, he could:<br/><br/>1. Resort his downloads pages into cleaner catgories, with automated or "add-it-yourself" outlinking to resources (including forum threads about his games).  This would add some utility to his site, as well as increasing the real estate (number of pages).  Then he might organise his site design to make room for a couple of tower ads here and there (nothing animated, and screened in advance for "being topical").  The combination of these thing increases traffic and adds another (puny) revenue stream.<br/><br/>2. Organise his free PDF publications/supplements into little books and compilations, and hook these up to Lulu.  Anyone can still download them for free post-ransom - but you can also buy 'em in print.  Yet another little revenue stream comes online.<br/><br/>3. And so on.  Wander around the world of Webcomics for a while; this is where they <i>live</i>.<br/><br/>If you don't mind the (not very large) time and energy required to maintain a bunch of (not very large) streams of revenue, it becomes quite possible to play on the 1000 fans model.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_175729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/175729/#Comment_175729" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-21T18:28:43+00:00" title="October 21, 2008  6:28PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not 1000 fans.

They aren't your revenue stream, they're just the core of it. I think it's about not climbing the mountain again for the first time every time you put a product out there.
