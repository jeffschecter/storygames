So what's the big deal?  Even if you were the most avid design follower, you wouldn't have a clue who I am, but this month I wrote a <a href="http://cobwebgames.com/index.php/games/" rel="nofollow">game</a> about brutal manhunts for Nathan Paoletta's <a href="http://rpgchallenge.wordpress.com/2009/10/04/new-challenge-two-games-one-name/" rel="nofollow">Two Games One Name competition</a>. After I posted up news of the beta release on RPGNet, I noticed the Urban Manhunt topic quoted above, by Cynthia Celeste Miller (<a href="http://spectrum-games.com/slasherflick.aspx" rel="nofollow">Slasher Flick</a>).  It had been posted just 6 hours after mine.<br/><br/>Two games of the same theme announced just hours between one another?  Seems unlikely, but I've heard it happens in many creative genres, from books, to computer games and even to film (Capote/Infamous). Does this kind of thing happen a lot?  When it does happen does it mean anything?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243813/#Comment_243813" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T05:08:59+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  5:08AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently it happens all the time in the movie business.

More than likely, Spectrum's game will be ace.  It's a card game about murdering crims. What could be more satisfying?\n<blockquote>If Spectrum games is announcing an imminent release, they have been working on it for more than a month.</blockquote>\nYeah, Spectrum have been working on this since early this year.  Which means it's probably all the better.  I don't care who's been working on what for longer, or whether our games compete.  I'm more interested in the coincidence that had the last month of my life devoted to an indie game concept that was broadcast on the same day as I broadcast my own version.  It's cool, and weird, and maybe it happens all the time, but it's the first time it happened to me.<br/><br/>Cynthia Celeste Miller has a good reputation.  A couple of my friends played a game of Slasher Flick at Gaelcon and they described the character generation process (it works like exquisite corpse).  Lovely design.  So I guess that her card game homage to violent movie manhunts will be of the highest calibre.  Just for synergy's sake, if nothing else, I'll be ordering a copy of Urban Manhunt at release.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243829/#Comment_243829" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-26T06:47:18+00:00" title="November 26, 2009  6:47AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sebastian K.

I've never played an indie card game before and what better place to start than to do a bit of 'research' for my own project, and have a bit of fun at the same time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244150/#Comment_244150" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-29T14:59:08+00:00" title="November 29, 2009  2:59PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Clearly, some people have the ability to steal ideas <i>from the future.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
