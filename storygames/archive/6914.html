After his Soviet troops made a timely counterattack and trounced my Finnish ski troops in Memoir '44, it was time to move on to the real gaming.<br/><br/>He pulled out his copy of 'Crimefighters', a pulp RPG that was written for the way out of print <a href="http://drmikessteakdinner.com/2007/07/06/download-dragon-magazine/" rel="nofollow">issue 47</a> of Dragon magazine back in 1981.  Hell, I remember buying that issue as a 13 year-old at the Judges Guild store in Decatur, Illinois!<br/><br/>If you've tried to play any of the really old rpgs recently, you'll know that it can be a real chore and not always that fun.  So we decided to use this as an experiment in group content creation and additional indie hippie goodness.<br/><br/>We each created a character and would switch GM roles between scenes, taking one character through their adventure and then switching to the other unrelated adventure.<br/><br/>Robert created:<br/><i>Dr. Sinister, the Left Hand of Justice AKA Wilken Decatur, scion of the Hampstead Decatur's<br/>Wilken was shot down over the Western Front in 1918 and suffered from bad burns in No Man's Land for a week.  Now horribly scared (and addicted to morphine), Decatur ranges out from his ancenstral mansion just outside of Boston, seeking to bring to justice those "smiling villains" of society.<br/>He is skilled in driving, piloting, safecracking, lockpicking, judo, climbing and rope swinging.  His special power is "Fear".</i><br/><br/>Chris created:<br/><i>"Tiger" Aurora, Master of Disguise.<br/>"Tiger" grew up on the streets of San Francisco in the bawdy Mission District.  His young life as a low-rent vaudeviller and shoeshine boy was interrupted when he joined a traveling circus and learned the carny trade while solving the murder of a Viennese knife thrower.  Now he fights for those who cannot defend themselves.<br/>He is skilled in mimicry, disguise, slight of hand and stealth.  His special power is "Shadow Control"</i><br/><br/>Now we decided to create some <b>scene cards</b> using blank note cards.  We each got 12 cards and wrote down a phrase or sentence on each.  4 each of "person", "place" and "thing".  We flipped them over and put all 24 cards in the random pile in the middle of the table.  Each time a GM was going to run a scene for the other character, they would draw four scene cards and keep three of them, returning the fourth back to the pile.  We kept the content generic enough that it could be used for either Boston or San Francisco.  We had talked about maybe having adventures in the jungle or whathave you, but we both were into the urban adventure and that make the scene cards much easier to handle.<br/><br/>Before we started play, we switched off asking questions about the other player's character.  Questions like "You have a secret admirer.  Who is it?" and "You kept a souvenir from the Viennese knifethrower who was killed.  What was it?"  This was a nice way collaboratively add some content to the character beyond their stats and backstory.<br/><br/>And since I wanted something to hang my hat on for the story, we both came up with names for our character's story that each GM could look at for inspiration.  These were written on folded note cards in front of us.  Robert's story was <i>Case of the Laughing Millionaire</i> and mine was <i>The Case of the Coit Tower Strangler</i>.<br/><br/>Some of our scene cards were:<br/><i>A dangerous known criminal comes pleading for aid<br/>A crowded side alley in an ethnic ghetto, during a festival<br/>A cabbie with a peculiar obsession that constantly distracts him while in traffic<br/>An ocean liner, thought to be lost, just entering port<br/>A dwarf cardsharp wearing a monocle<br/>A dope den in Chinatown<br/>A bubblegum snapping flapper good-time girl with a secret, unlikely skill</i><br/><br/>And since these were genre-sharp but location generic each GM would add their own notes to the cards to assist in working them into their scenes.<br/><br/>We ran a scene or two each to play out the mechanics, but I won't go into the details here.<br/><br/><b>Analysis</b><br/>I thought Crimefighters was the shiznit back in 1981.  But using a 2008 lens, let's be honest...it's no Spirit of the Century.  The game is designed to have the GM run the players through his adventure.  Our addition of hippy mechanics only partially shrouded this.  There's no "driving force" for the characters in this game besides finding the bad guys and shooting them.  So when you've seen the future in the way of BW and IAWA, it's tough in some ways to go back.<br/><br/>And as I found from a previous experiment in switching GM roles between two players, creating coherent plots on the fly can be *hard*.  <br/><br/>We did have a lot of fun with the scene cards, and I could see these being a good way to generate content for a game with more people, either GM'd or GM-full.  It's nice because you can get your own content ideas in there, but also be surprised by what others came up with.  And letting the person setting the scene add their names and faces to these cards makes the card "ownership" even looser.<br/><br/>And even though we both wrote a little backstory on the backs of our character sheet cards, it was fun having the other person pose questions.  It made you think even more about your character, just before you start play.<br/><br/>Any thoughts?  Komradebob, did I give the session/experiment enough justice?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_153866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153866/#Comment_153866" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T12:16:46+00:00" title="June 30, 2008 12:16PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well hrmmm. I think that having the content so secret until drawn made things hard to come up with on the fly. I can think of a few ways to kink that stuff up which might have aided the GM end of things.<br/><br/>Off hand, having a player draw two cards to start, choose one, and reveal the second might work better. Sort've a Gin mechanic for the cards, I guess.<br/><br/>Oh hell, come to think of it, I could see Gin being a decent basis for adventure building off the content cards. Instead of suits, you have element types: Person, place, setting and event? The first person to get a certain combo ( perhaps based on The Pulp Scramble thread-steal Jason's categories for suits, maybe?) lays down their cards ( as per Gin) and becomes the GM.<br/><br/>( A seperate category for titles?)<br/><br/>I guess in a multiplayer situation, the GM chooses which main pulp character to focus on. The owner of that character then ust create other related characters for the remaining players to use, a bit like the Doc Savage's FearsomeFive or The Shadow's agents.<br/><br/>I also like your idea that eaxch scene must have some sort of excuse for a die throw or it doesn't count.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153968">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153968/#Comment_153968" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-30T18:03:14+00:00" title="June 30, 2008  6:03PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a really great AP report.

I think Crimefighters was more of a focus than anything else, because it was something both of us could grab onto. <br/><br/>Plus, the random chargen from such an old game actually did a lot to help the initial spark for ideas. Dr. Sinister got his name due to the fact that characters have both a right hand and left hand accuracy d% score. Despite being given a chargen bonus for right-handed accuracy, I ended up with something like a 30% R-Hand and a 80% L-Hand accuracy.<br/><br/>Anyway, trying to justify that led to a ramping up of the creative juices, and things just jumped forward from there. Several different forms of creative brainstorming actually took place.<br/><br/>On the downside, I did find that actually attempting to pull a traddie style adventure, especiually a GMed Mystery(ish) out of that proved much harder than the earlier bits. I've been pondering a few different ways to make all of that work a little easier, actually. Perhaps a simple generic plot structure there would be good, a sort of template to start plugging stuff into, or even a plot "tree".<br/><br/>[Keep in mind that I'm not looking for something Deep and Hippie. I'm looking for a shallow, whiz-bang, action kinda thing that can be put together and played through in about the same amount of time as it would take to read a pulp short story, to maybe three times as long. Chris can answer what he' want himself]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
