While he's a very sweet and personable child, he has a tendency toward what's called "parallel play," which means he'll play <i>near</i> someone and <i>around</i> someone, but not <i>with</i> someone.  It doesn't mean he doesn't enjoy the time spent, only that his engagement isn't what it might be for you and I.<br/><br/>I've been trying lately to play more games with him and his mother.  Mostly board games as mentioned <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11186&amp;page=1#Comment_248649" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>.  He enjoys these and has repeatedly asked to play <i>Galactic Heroes</i>, which pleases me.  He's even tried to expand that game's play into his more general collection of <i>Star Wars</i> toys.<br/><br/>Anyway, I've been wanting to run some RPG stuff for my wife for a while, and figured I would do something very simple just to get the GMing rust off.  I settled on <i>The Matrix</i> by way of <i>Wushu</i>: jack in, get something done and head for an exit.  My wife was working out her character when my son started asking questions about what we were doing.  I asked him if he wanted to play and he said yes, so we made a simple character for him.  I didn't argue when he said he wanted to carry a hunting rifle under his jacket.<br/><br/>I honestly didn't think he would understand what we were doing, but he took to it immediately.  I simplified the already straightforward scenario and put them in an office building with a computer mainframe that needed to be hacked.  My son is fascinated by elevators and security systems, so the break-in got him very engaged and I added details like motion-detecting sensors at his suggestion.<br/><br/>I have had neurotypical, adult players who've done less roleplaying than this kid.  He referred to his mother by her character's name and when it came time for the Agent to show up \u2014 because an Agent <i>always</i> shows up, you know \u2014 he was all, "I get my pistols!" and acting out the kind of two-gun shooting that would make the Wachowski Brothers proud.  He was into it and coming up with more ideas that I incorporated into the ongoing story.<br/><br/>We did jumping from building to building.  We did taking out a helicopter in midair with nothing but fists and knives.  We also did a spectacular crash-landing in the middle of a busy intersection that ended the scenario with a literal bang.<br/><br/>Now granted this was a game that lasted maybe 30 minutes, but I considered it a big success.  My son immediately asked if we could do it again, and I told him we'd try to play the next night (tonight).  I'll likely keep the action on a tight track because his mind tends to wander, but the mere fact that he wants to play again right away makes me very happy.<br/><br/>Are we likely to do lengthy, intense roleplaying?  Certainly not any time soon.  He's not just autistic, but he's <i>nine years old</i>.  Think of the kind of roleplay you did at that age and then dial it back a little bit to account for his condition and you have the right idea.  Maybe as we get older we can put more into the games, but for now if this is the kind of thing that lets us share the pastime together, I'm more than pleased.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249241/#Comment_249241" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-31T07:17:15+00:00" title="December 31, 2009  7:17AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My only thought is to copy your post and then paste it into a post on Story Games so everybody can see how awesome it is!<br/><br/>But... wait...

How great that you found something that clicks with your son \u2014 I have a 14-year-old son who's kinda Asperger-y and kinda ADHD-y, and I know it can be hard to find the right thing that engages him together with others.<br><br>I've been wanting to do some roleplaying with both my kids (he has an 11-year-old sister who's basically neurotypical, if a bit flighty) but keep being blocked by my own perfectionism, wanting to create some killer campaign scenario. Maybe I should emulate you and just set up a crazy one-shot situation to go wild in. (Hm, maybe I could try out Danger Patrol...)<br/><br/>The funny thing is, my kids have been avid story gamers since they were about 4 and 7. They sit around and make up totally absurd stories out of a dense gumbo of every pop-culture favorite (Sonic the Hedgehog, Pikachu, Strong Bad...) and a bunch of their own characters. They alternate narrating what happens, and act out the characters in first person with funny voices. Very Narrativist. The main difference from, say, Universalis is that conflict resolution happens not by dice or karma but by raised voices and threats to leave the game. (Although as they get older there's been more consensus-building.)<br/><br/>I'm not sure how to build from this into more, uh, traditional roleplay, though. I'm afraid that any scenario would derail into the crazed adventures of Dr. Robotnik giving Munchlax a haircut with a circular saw while the Cheat stuffs them both into the crisper drawer. Which sounds awesome on paper, but gets totally migraine-inducing after a half hour or so, believe me...                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249392/#Comment_249392" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-02T15:17:13+00:00" title="January  2, 2010  3:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: snej</cite>I've been wanting to do some roleplaying with both my kids (he has an 11-year-old sister who's basically neurotypical, if a bit flighty) but keep being blocked by my own perfectionism, wanting to create some killer campaign scenario.

I had these ideas about weaving in the disappearance of Neo at the end of <i>Matrix Revolutions</i> \u2014 spoiler alert for the three of you out there who haven't seen the movie, by the way \u2014 and how the mainframe was actually plugged into the main data line that supported the local structure of the Matrix but that went right out the window as soon as my son started play.  It became just place, thing and what happens over the course of 20+ minutes.<br/><br/>Obviously I wouldn't run a game that straightforward with adults, but they're <i>adults</i>.  Kids are a lot less discriminating about their plot structure and sometimes 1+2=3 is the best formula to follow.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249479/#Comment_249479" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-03T20:17:07+00:00" title="January  3, 2010  8:17PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, this thread (in part) inspired me to homebrew a simple Universalis-lite GM-less system and play it with my kids last night. <a href="http://story-games.com/praxis/comments.php?DiscussionID=74" rel="nofollow">I posted about it on Praxis</a>, including a link to a PDF of the rules I made up.<br/><br/>The soundbite: "Giving narrative control to my daughter is like giving a monkey a chainsaw".
