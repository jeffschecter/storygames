One's good, the other isn't.<br/><br/>That got me thinking. In a hippy way, does it make sense to you to understand stress vs. love?<br/><br/>So, when I'm writing (and playing), I get a real sense of stress. I burst with adrenaline, like its a prickly, tactile thing breathing on my neck. It helps me write, push, whatever. But rarely, if ever, do I remember that I'm making a choice to react like this. I feel good, tripping over myself with enthusiasm, but I also get a knot somewhere.<br/><br/>I was told that stress and depression are choices. We chose to stress, we chose to depress. It's the best we can do with what we've learned.<br/><br/>So, lately, I've been trying to change things up. What if, today, I look at the design/gameplay as something that loves me? I can think about it as a creature, a friend of mine, that wants to play and learn about itself. I can, if I start breathing deeply, and counting to myself at the keyboard (it looks weird, I guess, which gets me thinking about pride), imagine the design as a friend who not only loves me and wants to play, but wants me chat to it occasionally, and not always make it about business. Actually, it's doing its best to do what I ask, and its ready in a beat to try something else out. It totally cares if it pleases me. We forgive each other.<br/><br/>Do you ever feel like you should be enjoying what you're doing, but then, on reflection, can't figure out if you were? Am I the only one who chooses to stress out like this? If not, do you do anything hippy to calm yourself down? Help me chill out?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320906">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F" title="Alex F"><img alt="Alex F" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/746/n1IV3AA06DPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex%20F">Alex F</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320906/#Comment_320906" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T10:35:02+00:00" title="April 16, 2011 10:35AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds like a neat idea to animate (in the animism sense) the objects that you are currently struggling with. Haven't explicitly done it, but may give it a try now!<br/><br/>Another way to switch things up could be to switch your expectations. "Gosh, I'm feeling stressed! Guess I'll have to spend twenty minutes writing the boring paragraphs/stuff that I'll need to rewrite later". See how you feel when you approach it that way. <br/><br/>I can see a lot of value in writing from adrenaline <i>some</i> of the time, but I agree that you want to be able to toggle that on and off or risk burnout.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320907/#Comment_320907" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T10:51:23+00:00" title="April 16, 2011 10:51AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a dividing line between stress and excitement (which seems to be a possible version of what you describe)?<br/><br/>There is a difference between fear and butterflies in your stomach before a date with someone you've fallen in love with.<br/><br/>Of course, in a Buddhist view, both come from attachment and are therefore negative in nature.<br/><br/>In any case, a thought-provoking post, thank you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_320908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320908/#Comment_320908" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T11:04:49+00:00" title="April 16, 2011 11:04AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like the muses are playing with your mind!!<br/>\n<br/>\nBeing filled with inspiration has a moral responsibility maybe? fear of it leaving, desperation trying to hold on to it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_320909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/320909/#Comment_320909" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-04-16T11:46:18+00:00" title="April 16, 2011 11:46AM">April 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2011 11:46AM by jason.">edited April 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Is there a dividing line between stress and excitement (which seems to be a possible version of what you describe)?</blockquote>\nBiologically, I believe "excitement" would look more like a good balance of stress, where you tip into things like "stressed out" and then "depressed" when you push it too far.

Imagine that it has your best interests at heart, and think about what message it is sending you". <br/><br/>He knows lots of writers' tricks, so maybe he learned it from that? Anyway, I was impressed with the idea of making friends with the writing difficulties you're experiencing, of assuming that they exist for good reasons, and that they're trying to help you.

The conversation goes like this:<br/><br/>Me: Hey Idea, why are you pressuring me? I don't have time to do anything with you right now. Leave me alone!<br/>Idea: Pardon?<br/>Me: You heard me! Leave me alone!<br/>Idea: Sebastian, are you feeling okay? You look a little stressed out.<br/>Me: Me? But\u2014<br/>Idea: Put your feet up. I've got loads of time.<br/><br/>So, yeah, just asking the stress a question feels like a back-rub. Has anyone else tried that? Could you? I'd be really interested to find out what you think.<br/><br/>As for stress vs. excitement, I believe that stress is a risk-averse energy while excitement is a risk-neutral energy (so what's risk-friendly?). I think the line between the two has something to do with fear. I also believe that stress is doom while excitement is destiny.
