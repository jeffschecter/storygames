You gotta play a lot of games, mostly, and surround yourself with people who enjoy talking and thinking about games with you, and who aren't afraid of new and different things.<br/><br/>I'm guessing you're in West Africa? What RPGs are popular there? What kind of games have you played so far? What have you enjoyed most about them?<br/><br/>Also, someone from Scandinavia please respond, because we haven't got much RPG scholarship in the USA.

Thus it is eminently suitable for use with whatever is unique to your own culture, within the scope of TV-entertainment.<br/><br/><b>3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars</b> is a role-playing game of the classical kind (with a GM), but quite modern in its tight premise and furiously fast interaction. It's eminently suitable for seeing how you may create a game of great depth with simple methodic tools.<br/><br/><b>Until We Sink ...</b> is a modern roleplaying game with a revolutionary card-based method. This is a must to play and study. It points towards the future, in its use of a simple method to create the foundation for explorative, almost freeform, interaction.<br/><br/><b>Some role-playing poems</b> should be played, and designed. The short form of role-playing (15 minutes of game-play) is eminently suitable for trying out your own concepts as a designer, getting the feeling of completing a design, having it played and receiving the reactions of your players. And then it goes to show how simple a role-playing game can be, and still be effective.<br/><br/>- there may be one or two games in addition, which is worth playing, to fill out the picture and to inspire your own design-endeavours. Good luck! Take care!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
