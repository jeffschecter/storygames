I finally sat down, did the tinkering, and would like some input on it. I added a card to the chargen and did some reworking of the other two but the setup is basically the same. I had a couple thematic things I wanted to see more of such as getting as many bonus dice as possible. Several of the powers affect bonus dice and the additional card gives the player even more things to check off. I wanted the Origins to each have a distinctive feel but I wanted them also to be open ended enough that you could make just about any super hero or villain you could imagine so there are three that are sorta build-your-own-origins while still, hopefully, having their own flavor. I also like minions and henchmen as small threats to tie up super heroes so I included more powers that let them hit multiple Threats. However, even if they weren\u2019t using one and what they were doing was really cool, I let them do it anyway. Lastly, I\u2019m working flashbacks into more of the game than just the \u201cPreviously On\u2026\u201d section since, as all good comic nerds know, continuity is a reward unto itself and we want to create as much of it as possible as fast as possible. I\u2019m thinking of ways to encourage that more, though, so please let me know what you think of Retcons, Bold New Directions and the like. I\u2019m not a graphic designer so I just put it together quick and dirty in Word so it could be tested. Please download, play it and let me know what you think of it!<br/><br/>My group tried it out last night and here are a few highlights.<br/>\u2022\tEverybody felt the need to give themselves a love interest in their \u201cLast Issue\u2026\u201d section including the robot (he rides in her pocket as a handful of pennies most of the time).<br/>\u2022\tCopper Lincoln, Robot Malleable Daredevil, is the sensational character find of 2010. He sprung into existence when somebody accidentally dropped a handful of pennies into the Large Hadron Collider and spent a lot of the game split into a thousand tinier versions of himself. At one point he tried to turn a villain\u2019s powers against his minions by having each of the tiny Lincolns grasp the ankles of another to form a giant, copper CB antennae as a power conduit.<br/>\u2022\tThe Mighty Samson, Altered Human Powerhouse Warrior, fights crime with a giant barber pole and gains his powers from mysterious hair tonic. A priestess of Neptune from the undersea nation of Pacifica is in love with him because her myths tell of a savior who fights with a striped club. They can never be together, though, because Samson reverts to his lackluster alter ego if his hair gets wet and the tonic washes out.<br/>\u2022\tThe Stag Beetle, Cybernetic Insectoid Protector, was described as the love child of Blue Beetle III and Hego from Kim Possible.<br/>\u2022\tVillains: alien cockroaches, Le Toupee and his rototic minons Le Cleepers, and the Mechanist and his Improbable Mechanations.<br/>\u2022\tThe Stag Beetle\u2019s alter ego, Buck Kord, is a formula one racer in his secret identity.<br/>\u2022\tCopper Lincoln disguised himself as coins in a bank heist and, therefore, lost bits of himself when some of the space roaches got away. This kind of thing apparently happens a lot.<br/>\u2022\tSamson kept on creating moves based on haircuts including the time he knocked out three or four robots with \u201cSaturday Sale\u201d by yelling \u201cEverybody gets a haircut!\u201d<br/><br/>I hope that piques the interest!

"Unfathomable Plum-Blossom Stance!"</blockquote>\nAs for what was used, old-school InDesign CS1. Made a basic template to use for the cards, and then entered the variable information individually.<br/><br/>And on the subject of a Danger Patrol kung fu, "Flaming Rooster Palm" is actually VERY close to how I was writing things up. Characters would have five total cards, a Role (scholar, warrior, bandit, etc.), a stylistic Background (Old Master, ...from Wu-Tang, ...with White Hair, etc.), a Path (five Chinese elements, Heaven, Earth, and Buddha), a Style (animal forms), and Form (a particular attack type or stance). The Path, Style, and Form I envisioned as being useful on their own, but when all three components are combined together, they form your Ultimate Technique, such as "Flaming Rooster Palm." Actually, when I originally was writing my notes, one of the combinations was "Flaming Cock Chop." All together, with eight options per card, there would be over 32,000 combinations (which thrilled the hell out of me). But whenever I try to write up the necessary details for each card, something comes up to distract me.<br/><br/>Since I'm going to participate in the Design a Game in a Month thing on Praxis, maybe I'll try to finish it (which I plan on calling "Eight Fists of Danger"), either that or my Stormtrooper game called "Screw You, Rebel Scum!"<br/><br/>...or maybe both. But that may overextend my limited brain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269665/#Comment_269665" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-01T21:00:15+00:00" title="May  1, 2010  9:00PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Michael, <br/><br/>The cards are awesome, but just as a point of constructive criticism, it seems to me that the role should be in the third slot, and the powers in the second slot.

Maybe when Josh makes any changes or additions, I'll try another arrangement. Plus, when designing on-screen, it was kinda hard to tell how legible everything would be when printed...and my house printer is crap. So when I get back to my copy-monkey job on Monday, I'll be able to print out a copy, and start making red-pen marks.<br/><br/>And I love creative criticism.
