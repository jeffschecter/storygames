Here's how it went:<br/><br/>First, I tried to tell my friends what the game is about. This was unexpectedly difficult! "It's about a bunch of people who try to do something together and maybe betray each other a bit." Since the game is so wide in its scope, it's a bit hard to pitch. I really liked playing it and would love to run it at conventions, but I'm struggling a bit to find a good elevator pitch that will get people excited, except just telling them "This game is really fun, you guys, I promise.".<br/><br/>Anyway, they were all keen on playtesting something new and I read the different playsets. We agreed on The Cure, where we portray a bunch of scientists trying to cure a disease. We decided on twisting it a bit, though, setting it in medieval times and portraying monks in a monastery. The main obstacles to our quest wasn't going to be the difficulties in curing the disease, but rather convincing people that it's not a curse, and dealing with the dogma and inflexible rules of the Church. The illness was called the "stiff-plague" and its effects were the gradual stiffening of muscles and joints, slowly paralyzing the afflicted until they could finally no longer breathe or pump blood, and died.<br/><br/>Our main characters were:<br/>A herbalist monk, wise in the ways of plants and an avid brewer of beer<br/>A scientifically inclined monk with dangerous ideas and nondogmatic beliefs<br/>The abbot of the monastery, firm believer in church dogma, but also a pragmatist<br/>and the abbot's brother, a nobleman afflicted with the disease, walking with a cane<br/><br/>The minor characters were mostly servants and other monks, amongst others the chef, who was later upgraded to main character when a fifth player joined us.<br/><br/>Our first task as trying to find human test subjects. This was probably a bit too rashly chosen, diving headlong into the action. There are three challenges in total in Follow, and the third one determines the success or failure of the quest. We proved incapable of throwing ourselves straight into the action, and the first challenge turned out not to have that much to do with our scenes, which were mostly about introducing our characters. Not sure how this is meant to be played. We really felt the need to introduce our characters, but this meant that the first round passed without us doing that much about the disease. As a result, we failed miserably, drawing two red stones from the pouch, which meant not only should we fail, but someone should betray or be betrayed by the fellowship.<br/><br/>This felt a bit too quick. We had just introduced our characters and seen them in action. Only a few minor characters had been seen at all, and then only in one scene. We decided that we would exclude poor brother Petrus, whose only real fault had been to fall and hurt his foot, but we accused him of faking it to skive off work. This betrayal was hardly felt and mostly seemed odd, but we kept on.<br/><br/>The second challenge was about actually finding a cure and convincing people we could cure the disease. There were some funny scenes here involving a chicken, and we started to get some conflicts. However, we really got going working towards a cure. The only one who wasn't happy was the nobleman, who didn't at all enjoy being put on a diet of leeks and drinking that horrible herbal beer brewed by the herbalist. This beer was made off the mould in the cellar, which was the source of the cure. The nobleman wrote to the bishop because he suspected people of ungodly methods. Everyone else collaborated on the cure, though, and we managed to succeed. Two white stones, hooray! Things are going well.<br/><br/>In the final challenge, things really kicked off. This was about convincing the church, represented by the bishop. The nobleman, having refused the beer in favor of wine and meat, started getting worse again and accused everyone of putting their trust in the mould instead of in God. He tried to convince the bishop of this. The bishop had a talk with the abbot, who had been skeptic about the mould at first, but was now convinced. The bishop ordered that the monastery's relic (a splinter of the cross) should be placed in the cellar where the mould was growing, and thus make a post-hoc miracle.<br/><br/>The herbalist and the scientist monk were livid. They had an intense conversation with the abbot. Really great scene! Finally, they declared they would not be able to stay in a monastery which lied and deceived the people. The abbot agreed it was sinful, but only this way could the people be helped. The abbot would remain and sacrifice his eternal soul by lying as the bishop demanded, thus helping the people. The two monks would leave the monastery and only tell of the lies after some years had passed and the disease was no longer a threat.<br/><br/>We all voted, the nobleman notably hoped that we would fail and all die of the plague. We got two red stones. Our efforts had been for naught. When the day came to proclaim the false miracle, the abbot couldn't bring himself to do it. He betrayed them all by telling the truth and denouncing the bishop as a deceiver of the people. For his efforts, he was excommunicated and the monastery was closed by the church. The mould was never utilized and the disease never cured.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>So, this was a really fun game! The rules were very simple and could pretty much just be read aloud to everyone as we played. What we missed was some chance to introduce our characters. We're really in the camp of "If it hasn't been seen in game, it's not yet real", so we needed the first round of scenes to introduce the characters. Next time I play it, if we have the time, I might want to run a set of quick introductory scenes before the first round. That way, we have time to get some plot done before the first (possible) betrayal.<br/><br/>We also felt that the characters got a bit two-dimensional. In the third round, however, they really got some depth and we could all feel the wrath of the monks and the painful dilemma of the abbot. It was nice.<br/><br/>Rules-wise, it all worked really well. We never had any misunderstandings or doubts on how the rules worked and we always knew what to do. We didn't use the rules on handling success too much (having to throw someone else under the bus). This is possibly because we had quite a bit of PvP conflict. It felt weird to use the rules for that, and this was the only place were we weren't sure on how to handle things. We let the scene framer decide on a winner in these cases.<br/><br/>Maybe we shouldn't have done so much conflicts between PCs, but then where else will the red stones and the betrayals come from?<br/><br/>Anyway, we all had a really good time and liked the game. We'll want to play this more, especially at conventions, since three of us regularly run games at conventions. So Ben, are you ok with me sending the files to the others for the purposes of running this game at cons, or would you prefer if we don't do that until it's released?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_454231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/454231/#Comment_454231" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-06-26T14:41:47+00:00" title="June 26, 2016  2:41PM">June 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Vad hette "stiff-plague" p\xe5 svenska?
