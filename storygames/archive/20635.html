On paper, the concept sounds pretty neat. However, I have no practical experience with the system. I was wondering what pitfalls people may have noticed with a mechanic of this type.<br/><br/>It sounds like the game is trying to get players to describe their character's actions as awesomely as the game considers PCs to be. Make your character sound like more of a badass and they are mechanically more badass. What's the downside here? Does a mechanic that attempts to foster this kind of behavior lead to some horrible unintended consequences? So far, the one downside I see is that it can stifle narration down into a specific mode or mood of description.  I'd love to hear people's thoughts on what this kind of mechanic is good and bad for.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452825/#Comment_452825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-30T21:52:16+00:00" title="April 30, 2016  9:52PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played a bit of Exalted a good while back (as in, 1st edition before the Lunars book came out). My impression of the stunt system is that while it's OK, it's not a <i>brilliant</i> use of design space. The best bit is the way stunting regains willpower or essence for you, which has interesting implications for the combat system overall, but that's just a mechanical feedback loop inserted into the otherwise mediocre idea of bribing people to describe things better. (I have the nagging feel that this notion of regaining resources in-combat could probably be hooked into something else aside from interesting fight choreography narrations.)<br/><br/>The idea of stunting per se is fine for me, but after trying out all sorts of variations, the one I've been most happy with has been one where stunting is an occasional <i>right</i>, as opposed to being a duty or extra work for bennies. For example, the way my D&amp;D homebrew works is that particularly good rolls allow you to stunt by describing how the "excess success" from whatever you were doing influences the situation. I feel that this works better (for my specific purposes) than trying to bribe the players into stunting; you still get the concept that players are encouraged to pay attention to the fiction and be inventive, but making it only an occasional event instead of something you're trying to do in every single action makes it less of a chore and more of a fun opportunity.<br/><br/>Aside from the Exalted "bribe players to encourage colorful narration" stunting and my "sometimes a solid hit is a trip and a disarm as well" stunting, you should also consider the Dungeon Crawl Classics stunting rule, which is basically that you declare an extra stunt to your attack action, and if the dice roll well, you get it; the concept of what a stunt is is the same as in my version (that is, a stunt is extra action effectiveness instead of recovered resources), but you choose the stunt in advance of rolling and it may or may not work. Interesting difference, although I find my way of doing it superior.<br/><br/>That being said, I think that the best way to make the Exalted style stunting system carry its weight is for the GM to stunt every single action consistently, and for the GM and whoever else buys into it to be didactically very clear about this being the expected way to play the game, and that's why these active, imaginative players are getting all these extra bonus rewards. By being very consistent about it you <i>should</i> be able to use stunting as added medium-term incentive for the players to be descriptive and interesting in their contributions, which may help over a couple of sessions in establishing group standards where everybody narrates, everybody uses their imagination; this outcome would be of no meager value to your typical rpg group with several shy, lazy, inward-turning people who would otherwise be happy to merely sit there and roll the dice. (Assuming that what you want is everybody opening their mouths once in a while, of course.) Needless to say, this way of using stunting absolutely requires you to keep the threshold of stunting success low - whatever it is that you consider an acceptable amount of narrative flair in an action, that's what your 1st degree stunt should be like.<br/><br/>(I'll add that as far as I know, the above is the canonical by the book intended use for stunting - you <i>should</i> get at least a 1st degree stunt in every action as long as you're actually contributing at all to narrating the fight instead of going "I hit them" and rolling dice on your turn. If it's not calculated into the essence economy, it <i>should</i> be, and if a player is consistently not stunting, they're doing it wrong in terms of intended playstyle.)<br/><br/>Also, comparing the Exalted stunt to <i>Primetime Adventures</i> fanmail should be pretty thought-provoking; they're very, very similar rules, but perhaps also different in some nuances?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452826/#Comment_452826" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-30T22:38:44+00:00" title="April 30, 2016 10:38PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main failure point of Exalted stunting is when GMs decide that a stunt isn't good enough for the most basic reward. Anyone doing <i>anything</i>, by the rules, should get the basic reward. Then if you do something superlative or ultra-on-point for the narrative or style, you get the advanced reward.  So long as you're doing that, it works pretty okay.  In other words, it's not as important as people think it is - it's not meant to make every Exalted combat into a grand masterpiece of fight choreography, it's just meant to spruce it up a bit.<br/><br/>There is a similar failure point in Primetime Adventures - when somebody, or worse, everybody, is judging each other's contributions too harshly and no fanmail gets awarded. That means the episode ends too quickly, the plot overwhelms the game (note that the person in charge of the plot in PTA cannot, repeat, cannot and ought never hand out fanmail) and (in 3e PTA), characters never struggle against their worst impulses. However, the PTA issue is challenging specifically because the game leader is absolutely prohibited from doing the thing that will at least get the game moving again. Only the other players can do that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scrape" title="Scrape"><img alt="Scrape" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/791/nYVCU4CTTPHBF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scrape">Scrape</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452828/#Comment_452828" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-30T22:53:58+00:00" title="April 30, 2016 10:53PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think stunting works well if it explicitly has to pull in established fictional details.

Even to the point of explaining the economy. <br/><br/>Exalted's stunting has always felt off to me, but I think this largely comes down to the GM being stingy with the rewards. You'd have to invent a masterwork of spoken choreography to even get a single die, which was a pressure that left me creatively drained and increasingly clutching at straws. And for what? An extra die in a large pool of dice? <br/><br/>Dungeon Crawl Classics, as Eero says, works out better: stunting is elective - something a player chooses to activate by picking up their Deed Dice                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452882/#Comment_452882" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-03T14:32:18+00:00" title="May  3, 2016  2:32PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, if you read the actual Exalted text that first die is supposed to be ultra-easy to get.

Sounds like the major issue is that there's some kind of confusion on the barrier to entry of stunting. Coupled with unclear directives for what constitutes a stunt of varying levels, I can see how the system would become frustrating. Potemkin had mentioned a fair bit of creative demand, did that ever end up too taxing for the rest of you? I recognize the context there was the GM had created a fairly high barrier to begin stunting. However, I'm looking at games like Wushu that have a pretty high creative demand, but that always felt easy as opposed to draining. Did anyone else feel like the stunting system created a pretty taxing creative demand on players?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452915/#Comment_452915" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T01:19:40+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  1:19AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only if the GM was not following the rules and making the first die easy to get.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452923/#Comment_452923" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T05:03:25+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  5:03AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people are really bad at it, but most people who are geeky enough to be playing Exalted have spent a lot of time imagining fight scenes in their heads and get the hang of it pretty quickly.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452927/#Comment_452927" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T07:30:52+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  7:30AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 4, 2016 7:31AM by Potemkin.">edited May 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Only if the GM was not following the rules and making the first die easy to get.</blockquote>\nThis, \n<blockquote>Some people are really bad at it... </blockquote>\nnot this. <br/><br/>Ultimately it came down to my GM saying "describe your actions in a cool way and you get an extra dice," and then being picky about what constituted a "cool way."

The incentives for stunting mess up the economy. Exalted combat is such a game of essence attrition, and those extra motes on every action prolong fights beyond palatability.<br/><br/>2. The reward for stunting lowered the descriptive quality of stunts over time.  In those days, every action began with a backflip and ended with the player asking, "Can I get a stunt die for that?."<br/><br/>3. The reward makes the process of description less satisfying. Even when you have cool things to say, it feels like you're doing it for the reward. The stunt dice rob you of the choice to just say something cool for it's own sake. (This may just be classic "<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20518/tangible-rewards-in-roleplaying-games/p1" rel="nofollow">tangible rewards in roleplaying</a>" territory)<br/><br/>An close alternative I've been thinking about:<br/><br/>Each player (including the GM) starts the session with a pool of X stunt dice.<br/><br/>When another player describes their action, you may give them stunt dice to demand further description.

I particularly like the idea of making stunting more of a prompted activity. And yet, as my design currently stands, I may be delving in the opposite direction. Perhaps you lot can take a look and help me turn it around?<br/><br/>Game genre is Supers. The procedure for play is: <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Describe your action</li><li>Determine "stunt level"</li><li>Spend Energy Points for mechanical effect</li></ol> Players roll pools of d10s. Stunting allows the following:<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Describing what you do on your turn allows you to add or remove die from dice pools per Energy spent. </li><li>Describe what you do + Do one of the following: Describe your hero attempting to follow their virtue or indulge in their vice for a greater edge. OR Describe your hero using the environment (i.e. not you or your target) in an interesting way.  This allows you to increase or decrease dice pools AND TNs (for you, ally, or opponents).</li><li>Do all three: Describe what you do, follow virtue/indulge in vice, use the environment. Increase/Decrease dice pools, TNs, AND Gain some temp HP or saddle an opponent with a strong mechanical negative (detail's not important here).</li></ul>\nMy purpose for doing this was two-fold: <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Keep the game mechanically simple. I don't have to make a crazy list of powers and say X power allows this mechanical effect, while Y power allows another mechanical effect. Any power could achieve the same effect, it's just locked behind the nature of your description on your turn.</li><li>Encourage a kind of play. The game is about the soap-opera drama of super heroes. So I built a way for them to use their Virtues and Vices to spur greater mechanical effect. The game posits that Supers are great not because of their power, but their insane drive to do crazy shit that normal people wouldn't. I qualified these drives as virtues and vices and said play into those more and your character is stronger. Your hero really believes in the virtue of courage, thinks that's an exemplifying trait for a hero? Great, on your turn, demonstrate how this world view shapes their actions and fuels their victory.</li></ol>\nIn the hopes of cutting down confusion on implementation I spent some time reiterating that lvl 1 stunting is a given, anyone can do it. Furthermore, I made pretty rigorous (&amp; hopefully clear!) criteria for lvl 2 &amp; 3 stunting. Hoping to guide players and GMs to see what kinds of stories the game is trying foster.<br/><br/>More than anything, I would like to keep some facsimile of stunting because it allows me to keep the game mechanically simple. Brainstorming after reading these posts, I was considering borrowing from Dirk and saying: Players get to cash in hero points to demand greater narration, but also unlock their own/an ally's ability to have wider/deeper mechanical effect. At a quick glance it would mean, each player can burn 1 Hero Point to up their mechanical ability to include changing TNs, but then they're required to give that second level of narrative. Burn 2 HPs to have all 3 mechanical effects, but now they're required to really push and hit that 3rd level of narrative. The interesting side effect is it could be a "everyone at the table judge to see if they hit the criteria." If not, the extra HP bid is lost, and they can only get whatever level of benefit the table thinks they earned. This would require very very clear cut criteria so that playtime isn't lost in disputes. Some sort of easy to absorb checklist.  I dont know.. I'm spinning out of control here. Ultimately, my purpose in adopting Exalted Stunting is clear, I'd prioritize mechanical simplicity over a guiding way to tell the game's story. I do a lot of that kind of work elsewhere in the system anyway. Any thoughts, any other ways I can hit my goals?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453069">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453069/#Comment_453069" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-08T19:03:20+00:00" title="May  8, 2016  7:03PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, I've never felt any appeal of rules like these. I've read many games with similar ideas.<br/><br/>OTOH, the "you can get Advantage if you can get the upper hand in the fictional space" of D&amp;D 5e was an eye-opener for me. The stunting rules in Exalted (and to a greater extent Wushu) seem <i>textual</i> or even metatextual. Where as Fate, PbtA and D&amp;D 5e encourage you to see the shared imagined space as real, to play with what's <i>in</i> it, not "the telling" of it (to borrow a phrase from LeGuin).<br/><br/>To me, that's absolutely delicious and exactly what I crave in games.<br/>5e isn't perfect -- there's a sense of "Naw, I already have advantage so I don't need to bother" that can come up. But\u2026 it was a valuable design lesson to me, and prompted a reread of Dice&amp;Clouds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453070/#Comment_453070" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-08T20:03:30+00:00" title="May  8, 2016  8:03PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sandra,<br/><br/>While my preferences are similar to yours in this matter, I think the basics of the matter come down to a few things:<br/><br/>1. If you can *inspire* exciting narration to begin with, instead having to build up a fiction and then try to work within it, you can get to the "cool stuff" faster and more easily.<br/><br/>There's lots of exciting fiction in this realm - where we are concerned with visuals and dramatic events rather than with coherence or even logical cause and effect. That's very exciting to some!<br/><br/>Consider a rule like this: "Once per session, you can pull an entirely unexpected object out of a hidden place. If you use it for something, you get +5."<br/><br/>With fairly little effort, you're likely to get some very cool and dramatic surprises in your game. ("I'm in the Duke's kitchen? Great, I pull out a vial of that intestinal virus we saw earlier at the lab, which I had discretely pocketed..." or "What, the will which outlines who inherits the bomb? Funny, I just found it here behind the couch. Without it, your plan is foiled! Whahaha!")<br/><br/>2. Following the fiction and adjudicating it creates very different character actions than free-wheeling creativity. I know I can get an advantage against an enemy by getting behind them, where they're not expecting me. But, if I'm concerned about success I might try to do so in the safest, most reliable fashion possible. Rules like these, on the other hand, can invite players to go the most impressive, daring, flashy, or unlikely maneuvers they can think of. That can create a different kind of excitement in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453075/#Comment_453075" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T01:53:40+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  1:53AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I consider that "pull out an object"-rule to be more inline with Fate/5e/PbtA than with the more textual games. It's a rule that adresses the shared imagined space rather than the telling, and as such it's a much mone appealing rule to me.<br/><br/>That said:<br/>1. Getting to "cool stuff" -- that depends on what your goal is. A cool telling, or a cool imagined experience. The map is not the territory. Both goals are valid and can lead to good games but to me I immediately feel the appeal of pretending to be somewhere else, someone else above spinning a riveting yarn.<br/><br/>2. Ok, that's laudable when it works but can easily break down into reviewing each other's "writing skill" ("Backflips again, Tammy? Ok, from now on, no repeated stunts!"). Imagining a situation that's so dangerous that we are driven to figure out safe and reliable approaches is exciting in itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453076">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453076/#Comment_453076" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T02:05:26+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  2:05AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm also not a huge fan of this kind of rule.

It's not lip service to description, it's just good tactics.<br/><br/>More generally I've opted for generalized circumstance modifiers (bonuses and penalties) to rolls based on fictional particulars. Players can "fish" for these in a way that I guess would fall under the rubric of "stunting" as discussed here, but ultimately it's a simple fiction -&gt; mechanics translation that we're looking for; you get easier rolls when the situation is more advantageous to you, not because you said the correct magic words. The skill involved pertains to realizing what about the circumstances should count and for how much, not describing things prettily.<br/><br/>Sandra probably has something similar in mind. Thing is, I don't think that this sort of thing has that much to do with Exalted stunting. One of these things is about encouraging players to invent fictional detail and lively description for the enjoyment of the group, the other is about analyzing the fictional situation as presented and recognizing the advantages present in the tactical situation so as to succeed in the situation and win. They're not merely different ways of doing the same thing, but actually entirely different activities, for different purposes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453086">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453086/#Comment_453086" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-09T08:41:20+00:00" title="May  9, 2016  8:41AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I attack the skeleton.

This is very much just rhetorics and semantics (hmm, am I in danger of bending my life vow -- "never again argue about semantics"?). <br/>The two prompts "Narrate sentences about your fictional character" vs "What are you doing exactly?" might give the exact same answers so from a behaviorist behavior, they're the same language act -- but they have different emotional and cognitive connotations.\n<blockquote>For me, the "how" is a key term that pushes players (me) to use more fictional detail rather than less. </blockquote>\nThe "how" is good, the "tell us" part is the problem.

In <a href="https://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2012/09/20/archipelago-iii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago</a>, another participate can say "Describe in more detail" when someone else is narrating, prompting them to do just that: add more details.<br/><br/>From what I could read in your post, and what you wrote on my wall, you could easily remove all mechanics and just present a structure. In <b>This is Pulp</b>, I gave each character a move. To overcome a danger, the player needed to use the move (like, using a vehicle or coming up with a fact) and describe how that moved can be useful. Each move also include three side effects: something gets destroyed, someone gets hurt, and something happens that delays the action for a while.

To me, roleplaying games are a lot about language and the way something is described is important to me when I game. Rules that encourage vivid and genre-appropriate description make me happy and most of my best gaming experiences have involved really beautiful language.<br/><br/>That said, I don't think "stunt bonuses" like in Exalted are a way to accomplish this. Saying "Say something awesome and we'll give you points" isn't helpful. Rather, I prefer games that HELP the players make better descriptions. Like Prosopop\xe9e, which never fails in getting amazing language and atmosphere. Actually, Prosopop\xe9e does have a fanmail mechanic, but that's not what makes it sing. Rather, it's the rules governing how you speak that help the players keep a coherent style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
