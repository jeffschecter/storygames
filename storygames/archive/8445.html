A few notes before we get started:<br/><br/>1) As I mentioned elsewhere, this was given specific permission by Andy. So don't go starting a thread like this without his permission.<br/><br/>2) Rooting for a side in this thread is cool. However, in general, please don't start a discussion here. If you have questions, do start side threads. I'll try to answer questions there, plus maybe this will prompt additional discussion, which would be cool.<br/><br/>Paul and I already did some of our game prep via email to keep this thread short. So, we agreed upon "grim fantasy" as our style and genre. Here are our characters.<br/><br/><b>Darius Longfort</b><br/><br/>Player: Paul T.<br/><br/>Aging knight, former King's Champion. Darius is well past his prime, and<br/>considered a relic by many.<br/><br/>Details:<br/>-Long, gray hair<br/>-Hooked nose, aquiline features<br/>-Wiry, tough, skin like leather<br/>-Old hauberk and armour, stained with the blood of wounds from decades past<br/><br/>Qualities (I think I am...):<br/>-Honourable to a fault<br/>-A protector of the innocent<br/>-A veteran and strategist: I never miss a detail on the battlefield<br/>-Weary of battle and killing<br/><br/>Weapon: Asglund, ancient claymore, now rusty from disuse.<br/><br/><br/><b>Criock</b><br/><br/>Player: Seth Ben-Ezra<br/><br/>Details:<br/><br/>--black spiky armor<br/>--a booming voice<br/>--a missing eye<br/>--long white hair<br/><br/>Qualities (I think I am...):<br/><br/>--honorable<br/>--loyal<br/>--determined<br/>--a leader of men<br/><br/>Weapon: a black two-handed sword with a skull-shaped pommel<br/><br/><b>Rules Note</b>: A Detail is something that would be obvious about your character if you looked at him for a few moments. This is purely for color purposes to assist the players in visualizing the characters. Qualities convey what a character is like...or, as the text notes, what a character <i>thinks</i> he is like. Qualities are narrative constraints. Neither Paul nor I may declare anything that would contradict a Quality.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186854">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186854/#Comment_186854" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T11:32:54+00:00" title="January  8, 2009 11:32AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now it's time for Opening Ceremonies.

It has seen many battles, as the blood of men and demons stain its side, feeding its desperate thirst. Today, it will drink again.<br/><br/>The sun vents its rage upon the earth, hammering the ground with radiant heat.<br/><br/>In the distance, a figure of a man, walking, his armor groaning as he moves. Awaiting him, another, in black armor, white hair blowing in the wind.<br/><br/>They meet in the shadow of the spire. The ground is rough and rock-strewn, but it is appropriate that they meet here.<br/><br/>There are no words. They have known each other too long for there to be a need. The only sound is the demonic howling of the wind.<br/><br/>Their swords are drawn, and their final battle begins.<br/></b><br/><br/>Okay, maybe it's overwrought, but that kind of thing works for me.<br/><br/>The next post starts our game proper.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187104">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187104/#Comment_187104" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-09T08:13:03+00:00" title="January  9, 2009  8:13AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Round One</b><br/><br/>Okay, to help everyone out, at the beginning of each round, I'll list the status of each character.

Some saw this as an auspicious beginning to a career; Darius himself considered it a sign that times were harder than ever.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The rain came in sheets, pouring down from an ink-black sky. Darius' Company rode hard through Oldforest, their horses sweating despite the cold night wind, riders wiping rain from their faces and straining their eyes at every shadow. Something was out here, killing the King's men.<br/><br/>And then... there he was: an imposing figure in black armor, adorned with spikes, stood under the bows of a mighty oak. Darius had never seen his like before; neither had his men, judging by their expressions. <br/><br/>He lifted one arm, calling his Company to a stop. "Halt, in the King's name! If there be any more with you, let them come out now!"<br/></b><br/><br/>Well, that was kind of long-winded, too.

I get my agenda, and I am allowed to give you yours, if that wouldn't be a contradiction.

I have come here to speak to you of matters of mutual gain."<br/><br/>"Of what?" Darius demanded.<br/><br/>Criock looked at Darius's men. "Not in public, Darius. Surely you of all people should understand that."<br/><br/>Comprehension dawned on Darius. He dismounted and gestured to his men. "Wait here," he said.<br/><br/>Criock extended his hand in greeting. Darius clasped it.<br/></b><br/><br/>And now the Dueling Outcome. My action is successful and I am allowed to let yours be successful, if that wouldn't be a contradiction.<br/><br/><b>Dueling Outcome<br/><br/>Criock's assault stuns Darius with its fury. He had been playing weak, trying to trick Criock into making an error. Instead, he is now on the defensive, desperately parring the violent blows rained down on him by Criock.

Time for the next Flashback:<br/><br/><b>Several years have passed since Darius agreed to betray his King. The raid was difficult, but Darius's information allowed Criock and his men to gain the element of surprise. The loyalists were scattered to the four winds, and the King was executed. As promised, Criock gave Darius his freedom.<br/><br/>One day, as Criock led his patrol back through the streets of the capital, he noticed a beggar, huddled in the shelter of a doorway, clutching a bottle of cheap wine. Criock was moved with pity and flipped the beggar a coin. The beggar snarled at him, "I do not want your charity, One-Eye." And so, Criock was surprised to encounter Darius again.<br/></b><br/><br/>And Criock's Agenda:<br/><br/><b><br/>Criock persuades Darius to accept his charity.<br/></b><br/><br/>And my dice selection:<br/><br/><span style="color: #FFFFFF;">2d6</span><br/><br/>Over to you for dice, and then we will do Stances.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_187805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187805/#Comment_187805" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T13:44:55+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  1:44PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2009 1:46PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Agenda:<br/><br/><b>Darius and his group rebels, similarly hidden somewhere nearby, overwhelm Criock and leave him, beaten, unconscious, in the town square.</b><br/><br/>My dice selection:<br/><br/>2d6<br/><br/>Over to you for stance selection.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_187806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/187806/#Comment_187806" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-12T13:47:32+00:00" title="January 12, 2009  1:47PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 12, 2009 1:48PM by greatwolf.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can't choose 2d4, since they are Injured.<br/><br/>ETA: LOL.

After months of bloody war, a new power, in the form of the Child King, took hold of the throne and the people. Both Criock and Darius were exiled. It wasn't until ten years later that they met again, this time on the high seas...<br/><br/>The bone-dry planks of the pirate ship creaked under the boots of Darius and the other surviving passengers of the Fair Lady as they stood their ground near its forecastle. The Fair Lady itself was nearly gone--only the tops of her masts still showed above water, just off to the starboard. Her hull had been breached during the boarding action carried out by Criock's pirate crew.<br/><br/>Criock strode forward to address the survivors now gathered on his ship.<br/><br/>"Lay down your arms! We outnumber you. As captain of this vessel, I give you my word that none will be treated dishonourably." Behind him, several pirates could barely hide their laughter, even as Criock attempted to put on a commanding air.<br/><br/>"He will do no such thing!" Spoke Darius, stepping in front of the other passengers. "This man's word is not to be trusted!" Turning to the men behind Criock, he continued, "Your so-called captain deceives even you. Hold him down and send two men to search his cabin. You'll see what he hides from you! Once you have seen, then make your decision! If you value your skins, you'll heed my words."</b><br/><br/>My Agenda is to expose Criock as treachorous to his crew, and cause them to rise up against him.<br/><br/>And my dice selection:<br/><br/><span style="color: #ffffff;">2d10</span><br/><br/>Over to you for dice, and then we will do Stances.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>[Showdown] Playtesting with Paul T. - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8445/showdown-playtesting-with-paul-t/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="[Showdown] Playtesting with Paul T. - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8445/showdown-playtesting-with-paul-t/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Okay.

It's interesting how having the Flash of Insight can be a real strategic advantage under certain circumstances...<br/><br/>Anyway, here we go:<br/><br/><b>The next few minutes were full of hesitation, awkward, tense silence, and then havoc erupted as everyone shouted at once, and men leapt at each other. <br/><br/>However, it was the pirates' lack of respect for their captain that won out in the end. While many could not disobey the instincts of loyalty bred into them by years at sea, the others were quick to turn upon their leader and ally with the newcomers. More than anything, it was the noble standing, the confident air of Darius which turned their minds--that, and the implied promise of wealth it carried.<br/><br/>After a very brief scuffle, Criock and the three pirates who did not dare to betray him were overpowered. The four were placed in a small rowboat and cast off to general sneering and laughter.<br/><br/>Darius was quick to take advantage of the situation, ordering the crew to prepare for him the largest cabin on the ship, from where he proceeded to issue work orders as he consumed any fineries and sampled all the good wine to be found on board. By his decree, all the other nobles in his company received a similar treatment.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Criock's little rowboat drifted aimlessly through the wreck of the Fair Lady, its four passengers watching Criock's former vessel rapidly dwindling in the distance. <br/><br/>"Hold! What's that, there?"<br/><br/>One of the pirates had spotted an attractive sight--a hand, heavily laden with jewels, had emerged from the water and wrapped itself around a piece of timber. Criock had the men paddle the boat over to the survivor immediately, then warded off the other men and helped him out of the cold water.<br/><br/>The survivor was but a young child, who, as they later found out, had stowed away in the ship's hold. More shocking than the story, however, was the child's identity--Criock recognized him immediately. It was his enemy: the Child King.</b><br/><br/>Over to you for Dueling outcome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196805/#Comment_196805" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-13T08:36:39+00:00" title="March 13, 2009  8:36AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome Flashback!

"This one laid hands on me and kidnapped me. I ought to put him to death. But, what do you think?"<br/><br/>Criock gazed down on his old opponent. He was beaten and bloodied, dressed in filthy rags.

That is exactly how you're supposed to play. And, as he says, it works better when you know your fellow player.<br><br>Of course, the next step is to then twist the nasty situations and events that I stick you in to your advantage.<br><br>Example: I was playing with my sister, and I was smacking around her character, taking him from being a heroic pirate captain to being a pathetic, sniveling twit. But then she managed to maneuver him into position to die saving his crew. So, despite all the lousy Qualities that I dumped on him, I'd say that she won.<br><br/>So, the first level of play is figuring out that the game is about cheap shots. The second level of play is learning how to turn your opponent's cheap shots against him.<br/><br/>Now, the thing that I think is neat about it all is that both those "levels of play" function at the social level. It's not enough for me to manipulate the mechanics; I need to know my opponent so that I can push his buttons during play.<br/><br/>That's why I say that this is actually a mean little game. In my head, at least, you "really" play on the social level, using the fiction to manipulate your opponent's emotions as much as you can stand.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197261/#Comment_197261" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T15:40:22+00:00" title="March 16, 2009  3:40PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, cool!

Witness Darius's return in Criock vs. Darius Longfort, Continued! Tonight at 6:00.<br/></i><br/>...<br/><br/>Flashback Outcome:<br/><br/><b>Criock bowed before the Child King, poised, awaiting his response to his suggestion.<br/><br/>The Child King rubbed his hands with glee. "Yes! Yes! Have the prisoners flogged, flogged! Whish-whish! Haha!" Spittle flew from the little boy's dark lips and decorated Criock's sweating, one-eyed face. A few of Criock's lieutenants fought to contain their laughter behind him as Criock winced and then straightened himself to his full height.</b><br/><br/><b>"And then we'll see how far their wittle legs can run! Much more delightful than just killing them." Criock grinned at the little boy's enthusiasm. <br/><br/>As the prisoners shuffled past the throne, one of the older advisors leaned in to speak into Criock's ear. "My Lord, this is a most fine ceremony, thanks of course to your daring, courage, and master planning." Criock grinned, oblivious, once again, to the snickering that took place amongst those of his men who were close enough to hear. "But certainly it isn't complete without a display of your own strength and glory? Surely the people will love you more if they can witness you slay one of these prisoners yourself?"<br/><br/>"I was just thinking of that myself, Councillor!" Criock ran a hand through his long, white hair. "But which one, which one..."<br/><br/>"Why don't you let the King pick the one for you to slay, o mighty Criock?" "Aye. But I will not slay him dishonourably."<br/><br/>And so it was. The Child King scrunched up his little eyes and searched through the crowd. With Criock's guidance, it was not long before Darius was chosen by the King.<br/><br/>Under the hot sun, in the city square, Criock and Darius squared off once again. Criock stripped down from his imperial mantle and cloak, and removed his heavy, jewel-laden Lord Protector's crown; Darius was unbound and handed a shield and a mace, in the manner of a gladiatorial slave. The crowd cheered and jeered, then fell silent.<br/><br/>In the dust of the summer heat, Criock and Darius traded blows as the Child King watched on, drool collecting in the corner of his wicked mouth. One moment they circled each other, raining blows on one another, blood mixing with the sand; then they were on the ground, wrestling. The crowd paused, shocked. The King's advisors froze, uncertain what was happening. A few well-placed, lucky strikes, and Darius rose, standing over Criock's crumpled form, breathing heavily. Both men, one standing, one lying, were coughing in the dust, exhausted by the heat.<br/><br/>"I want moooooore bllooooood!" Screamed the Child King in his shrill, high-pitched voice. "Tell them to keep fighting! Nowwwwww!"<br/><br/>But Darius would not move. He turned to face the advisors, the guardsmen, the soldiers. "Are you not the King's men? Why do you follow this fool and his false child King? Has Criock not told you what he did with your true liege?" Moving quickly, he took two strides over to the group of prisoners and pulled one of them into the arena. It was an older man, his back bent, his arms tied painfully behind his back, and a large canvas sack, stained with blood, covered his face. Darius pulled the sack off the prisoner's head.<br/><br/>There he was, for all to see: the true King, beaten, bloodied, unshaven, but recognizable to every man, woman, and child. "Here is your liege! Not that usurper and his lackey!"<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>The resulting skirmish was short and decisive. With their true King returned to them, few were willing to remain loyal to Criock and the monster child he'd planted on the throne as his puppet. The Child King was overthrown, and the King and those loyal to him restored to power.<br/><br/>Within a week, Criock was branded in the same city square as a traitor to the land and thrown into the deepest dungeons, as far away from sunlight and freedom as the people deemed fit.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_257644">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/257644/#Comment_257644" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-22T14:51:51+00:00" title="February 22, 2010  2:51PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And the Dueling Outcome:<br/><br/><b>His breathing wet and ragged from his broken rib, Criock grunts and reaches forward with almost inhuman strength, yanking blinded Darius's leg out from under him.

Let's see if I can set that up a little bit with the Flashback:<br/><br/><b>For eight long years, Criock wasted away in the King's dungeons. His frame shrunk and his hair grew longer and longer, but rarely did anyone descend to the lowest levels of the dungeons to witness his imprisonment. <br/><br/>At first, there were celebrations, men and women gathering in the streets to burn effigies or invent drinking songs about the terrible regime of the Child King. Slowly, those dwindled as the kingdom settled into a comfortable period once more.<br/><br/>However, in the eighth year of the King's Return, strange rumours began to circulate among the guards who patrolled the king's lowest dungeons. One day, Darius took a break from one of his leisurely banquets to pay a visit to his old enemy.<br/><br/>After the interminable descent into the lowest reaches of the palace, where the light itself seemed to recoil from the walls, Darius found himself approaching Criock's cell. The jailer, a round, soot-faced brute of a man, led him to the final corridor, then shuddered and made the sign of the cross. "There be somethin' wrong going in there, if you catch my meaning. The old madman, he... the wall..." The man was shaking, visibly frightened. "The old man, his cell-mate... he be consortin' with devils! I swears! And, and... <i>he</i>... the t-t-traitor, Criock I mean, is consortin' with him now. They been <i>talkin'</i>, like talkin' the devil-talk, or sharin' some secrets or else-wise, and none of my men will go near 'em for fear. They be takin' fright, thinkin' the old man can touch their very souls..."<br/><br/>Darius turned the key in the lock and threw open the door. There was a hole in the wall of the cell, like someone had slowly and painstakingly picked away at the stone until the two adjoining cells were connected by a narrow gap. <br/><br/>But in the middle of the room, on the floor, was Criock, straddling the corpse of a much older man. The ancient figure, dressed in rags, lay on the ground, limp as a dishrag, as though the very life had been sucked out of him. <br/><br/>Criock blinked at the sudden invasion of light from the jailer's lantern and looked up at Darius. His face was drawn, visibly aged; his eyes glinting with a hint of madness. Yet the strangest sign of all was the blood on his clothes, fresh, glinting in the lantern-light; on his hands, around his mouth, and on the floor, where it pooled to form strange, archaic symbols on the dirty floor of the cell.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260687/#Comment_260687" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T10:05:22+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 10:05AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yowza!<br/><br/>And what's Darius's agenda for this Flashback?<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_260700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260700/#Comment_260700" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T11:04:05+00:00" title="March  8, 2010 11:04AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, right, Agenda.<br/><br/>How about:<br/><br/><b>Darius forces Criock to admit that he is no longer human, but a sorcerous, bloodthirsty abomination.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_260753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/260753/#Comment_260753" name="Item_84" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-08T13:22:49+00:00" title="March  8, 2010  1:22PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, here's Criock's Agenda:<br/><br/><b>Criock escapes from the dungeon.</b><br/><br/>It's time to select dice.

"Uh... uh, w-w-what... what's going on here?"<br/><br/>Criock's single eye turned upon Darius, but, rather than matching his gaze, ran over him, darting up and down, left and right, like a caged animal on the lookout for danger. He did not speak; it seemed that Darius's entrance had distracted him from something he'd been deeply engaged in, the light of the lantern a painful intrusion into the small, private world he'd inhabited for long years.<br/><br/>Hesitating, unsure of what he was seeing in his old enemy's face, Darius spoke again, his voice sounding tentative as it bounced off cold, stone walls. "Criock... I have come down to, uh, let you free, for you have served down here long enough. It's time for you to see the sun again..." Then, glancing down at the garish scene before him: "But... what in the world?"<br/><br/>From the corridor behind him, the frightened whispers of the guards carried all the way to the cell: <br/><br/>"The <i>sul-kangin</i>! He's killed the <i>sul-kangin</i>..." <br/>"...the old witch, he is dead!"<br/>"One-Eye throttled the Occultist!"<br/>"The old man said if he were to die, my family's souls would travel the Underworld for eternity! Oh, Lord above, save me..."<br/><br/>Darius paused, unsure, as this creature before him looked nothing like the Criock he remembered. And yet, the white hair and the missing eye identified him well enough. Murders down in the dungeons were hardly unheard of. Uncertain, his voice sounding far less authoritative than usual, he continued: "Criock, I'm prepared to let you free, if you are willing to speak the Oaths before the King and enter his service."<br/><br/>For a moment, Criock was silent, his eye still staring uncomprehendingly into the light. Then, his hand darted down to close about the ancient neck of the old man lying below him. An inhuman snarl escaped his throat as his eye rolled back into his head and his lips twisted into a monstrous grimace. Darius shrunk back at that grotesque sound. <br/><br/>Then, suddenly, the old man's corpse was shrinking, the skin shriveling, as though he was being sucked dry... and, at the same time, Criock's shadow seemed to grow, as though it swallowed the light of the lantern, sucking it out of the cell's air. <br/><br/>Criock opened his mouth and screamed. The ceiling of the cell groaned for a moment, as though under terrible stress, and then collapsed, mortar and stone falling around the two prisoners. Darius darted back into the corridor, barely escaping from the cell before the ceiling came down all at once. Dust and debris choked the air; the lantern was snuffed out. <br/><br/>The guards shouted for help and fled, their panicked voices resonating throughout the dungeon's labyrinthine chambers.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>It took the Darius and the King's men over a week to clear the rubble and locate all the prisoners; many of the guards refused to descend to the lower level of the dungeon at all. The last body they found was the old sorcerer's: a shrunken husk, aged and brittle as the remnants of a wasp's nest.<br/><br/>There was no trace at all of Criock; no clues as to his fate.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_262294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262294/#Comment_262294" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T11:10:17+00:00" title="March 16, 2010 11:10AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, now to Dueling narration, which I get, as holder of the Flash of Insight.<br/><br/>Hmm, let's see....<br/><br/><b>Having caught his breath, Darius reaches out to pull Asglund out of the rock. But as his hand grasps the hilt, Criock's hand grabs his wrist. Darius screams as dark energy plays about him. Criock rises to his feet, invigorated by the life force that he is stealing from Darius. In this moment, Criock's true form is revealed as a tattered skeleton, crowned with a black crown, Asglund still protruding from his gaping eye socket. "Do you see what you have done to me?" he hisses as Darius. "Your lies and treachery have forced me to become this abomination. And for that, there can be no forgiveness."</b><br/><br/>And now, Paul is out of Ready dice, so we go to end game. Since I have Ready dice remaining, I win. This means that I get to state the outcome of the Duel, which must include the death of one of the characters and establish the immediate aftermath for the other character. So, here goes.<br/><br/><b>Without relinquishing his hold on Darius's wrist, Criock pulls Asglund from his head. Then, he bends over Darius. "I believe I will take this," he says. Then, he removes Darius's face. "I'll need that where I am going." Darius couldn't even scream as the rest of his body crumbles to dust.<br/><br/>Criock brushes himself off and then picks up Asglund. He examines his reflection in the blade. "Yes, that'll do," he says.<br/><br/>With that, he starts the long trek back to the capital. Darius was only a portion of his vengeance. Soon, the King would feel his wrath.<br/><br/>Behind him, the dust stirs fitfully in the wind and is carried away.<br/></b><br/><br/>Okay, Paul. Now you get to put together one last Flashback to connect the previous Flashback (in the dungeon) to the beginning of the Duel. You don't have to include both characters, but if you do, it represents the last time that Darius and Criock interact before the Duel.<br/><br/>And after that, we're done.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_262383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/262383/#Comment_262383" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-16T19:31:16+00:00" title="March 16, 2010  7:31PM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Seth.

The hand's fingers nailed together, folded over a small map showing a rocky ridge not far from the capital.  <br/><br/>It couldn't be from Criock, could it? There was no way he could have survived the collapse of the lower dungeons. And yet, Darius felt the fear creeping deep into his heart, born of doubt; a sense that Criock was not only alive, but would be his undoing. Criock's one-eyed stare began to haunt Darius's dreams, as though a premonition of death, inexorably approaching Darius out of a dim, uncertain future.<br/><br/>What little courage remained in Darius's heart had long fled, over the last eight years of banquetting, feasts, and parties at the King's palace, the long nights of wine, women, and song in Darius's luxurious apartments. Some nights, long after nightfall, he'd get up from bed to visit his chamberpot, and his eyes would alight on yet some other sign that Criock himself had once occupied these very rooms. These smalls hints teased at his resolve, endowing him further with the sense of certain doom, until he could not stand it any more.<br/><br/>Darius gathered together a company of his best men, a selection of his finest meats and wine, and a chest full of some of the King's finest jewels. (Surely the King wouldn't miss them, if they helped him be rid of Criock once and for all? Offering a chest full of luxury goods in exchange for leaving the realm seemed like a much safer way to deal with Criock, should his men fail to capture him first.)<br/><br/>The location marked on the map was beautiful, in its own way, completely desolate, wind-swept, untouched by the hand of man. This was the place sometimes called "the Demonlands", though how it had earned that name was not common knowledge. <br/><br/>They camped overnight between the rock spires, under a moonless sky, and, for seven nights and seven days, relaxed and consumed their reserves of fine food and drink. There was no sign of Criock, no sign of any human soul for miles around.<br/><br/>It was on the eighth morning that Darius awoke to an overcast sky and screaming winds. There was blood around his tent; otherwise, no sign of any of his men remained. The sun was barely visible, a dreary light spilling out onto the ground without providing much illumination.<br/><br/>Darius clambered out of his tent and picked up his sword. The sense of impending doom was stronger than ever. He stood up and walked towards the rock spire just North of his camp. There was... something there. A figure? A familiar figure? An embodiment of Darius's fears, or perhaps a hallucination brought on by last night's drink. <br/><br/>Then the sun came out from beyond the clouds, and its light was deafening. As its rays struck the ground around Darius, the rock soaked up the blood upon it, the parched earth and stone drinking it in with unearthly thirst.<br/><br/>Darius took another step forward. There was nothing else to do.</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8445/showdown-playtesting-with-paul-t" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8445/showdown-playtesting-with-paul-t" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/8445/showdown-playtesting-with-paul-t/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F8445%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F8445%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
