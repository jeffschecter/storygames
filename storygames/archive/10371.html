Will it fail? very likely. Could it be a fun exercise in creativity? To some yes, to others no. )<br/>\nSo I have been thinking about how kewl zombies and vampires are, and how equally clich\xe9 they have become. I was thinking there are a bunch of game designers, writers, and artists within the community why not be totally awesome and create our own \u201cthing\u201d!!! The idea would just be to have a neat meme that could occasionally appear within peoples work pointing back to a central location that would hold links to other works that incorporate the idea. <br/>\n  I think the generic draws to zombies and vampires should be considered when thinking up what our meme should be.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Generic threat: Zombies or vampires can be ported into almost any setting.  <br/>\n2. One of us!: Zombies and vampires play on the fear that the threat could be any one amongst us. Note that this does not mean that people need be able to turn into a zombie or vampire only that the threat be able to blend in.<br/>\n3. Scalable: One of the greatest advantages of these threats is that they could scale from a small town infestation/attack, all the way up to world zombification. On the vampire end a single vampire could plague a town harassing the inhabitants, or even a threat of ruling society from the shadows.<br/>\n4. Kinda lame when you think about it: When you get down to it a corpse that shambles around slower than a person walks, or a dead guy that wants to give you a nasty hickey and hides from the sun is not actually that cool. It is these staple aspects of the concepts though that makes what people do with recognizable.<br/>\n5. An element of history: Both of these concepts in some ways can be referenced back to actual historical beliefs. Now this one I am not to sure needs to be included it could probably be something made up completely and still work like Cthulhu.<br/>\n<br/>\n  So any way that\u2019s the idea I think it would be generally neat if we had a kewl clich\xe9 monster that belonged/originated from our little group here. I would generally like to see semi serious posts for non genre specific monsters, though joking about the monsters posted is fair game. I think it would be fun if the person whose monster was chosen placed it under creative commons with the attribution to the central location at which the links to other works could be found.<br/>\n(I will post my own ideas up when I am home and have some time to flip through some books on folklore and stuff)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230554/#Comment_230554" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T08:45:54+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  8:45AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ha, this is a funny idea. Didn't they already do this with owlbears? Gygax is practically folklore, right?<br/><br/>It's really difficult to create imaginative memes, though. You see, usually these things become things in the first place by being used with conviction in some original work that makes the name. These are in turn often seminal works that might even start or transform whole literary genres, so it's not entirely trivial to create a good meme. It'd be really cool if you could pull off making one intentionally.<br/><br/>Also, are you specifically looking for a monster? There are other similarly detachable memes, after all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko" title="Seth Drebitko"><img alt="Seth Drebitko" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i175.photobucket.com/albums/w135/sethbashwinger/fetusgoplayavatar-2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Seth%20Drebitko">Seth Drebitko</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230561/#Comment_230561" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-08T09:28:09+00:00" title="September  8, 2009  9:28AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well it would not have to be a monster it is just the easiest thing I can think of. ie. every one agrees on a non-genre dependant monster, the basic core characteristics and then just every so often creates something around, or inserts it into what ever work it might fit into.

Lets say something like this:<br/>\n<br/>\nPod People<br/>\n<br/>\nDesire: Reproduction/Survival<br/>\nForm: \u201cPod People\u201d originate from fleshy plant like entities that are completely mindless. The plant grows in a root network but through careful attention to detail \u201cclusters\u201d can be removed and planted elsewhere. The plant is capable of reactionary responses to its environment in the hopes to obtain living food, think that creepy horror movie in the Aztec ruins.<br/>\nThreat: Pods consume the blood of living entities, giving off a pollen like byproduct. The \u201cpollen\u201d is actually an infectious parasite that in small amounts is harmless though if you were to be in an environment heavy with the plants you would need to take protective measures. <br/>\n  Those infected will become lethargic as the parasite consumes adrenalin to reproduce mindlessly spreading through the body. As it forms clusters at the brain it begins to impede motor skills as well as a feral intelligence. Continued growth unchecked will slowly find the bodies internal organs changed to suite the parasite, with motor skills, as well as energy levels increasing along with intelligence of the parasite. The pod people also are able to mentally network via incredibly complex pheromones given off. <br/>\n  The pod people lose the ability to reproduce through the transformation process thus rely on humans to remain alive to continue reproducing for them. It is also in the best interest of the pod people to continue cultivating and spreading the Pod\u2019s which originally gave them life.<br/>\n<br/>\n  That is my take on a very generic pod person idea. It includes no origin which allows genre flexibility, and is threatening to all levels of civilization for the most part. Also just the basics on how they reproduce and things like that are provided such that your pod people might have immense strength and speed, while mine are just normal people. It also does not address what might happen to animals, or how intelligent they may become. <br/>\n  Thoughts opinions or better ideas welcome per the intent of the original post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230817">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

The fragments spent millions of years in space until they entered Earth's atmosphere in the form of meteorites and landed in several areas (the arctic, the farm belt of the US and locations in South America). The spore-like cysts sprouted root-like tendrils and grew into large pods. From a distance, they look like rough-shaped stone structures about a meter in height. The pods contain the alien life form and keep it protected from predators and from the elements. The life form is sensitive to chemical changes and will react to the presence of organic waste products (shit).  The life form inside is a mass of translucent tendrils connected to a flowering "shrub" of bruise-colored vegetable matter and will hatch once it detects those chemical changes in the environment. Like a fungus, it eats decaying matter and prefers a dark, damp environment. The tendrils then spread out to find living beings it can infest with its spores, creating sub-masses to anchor new tendril clusters. In the right environment, the life form can spread out to cover hundreds of square meters with its mass-tendril clusters. The "hub" of this spoked wheel is the central pod that birthed the life form but it's no longer dependent on that pod for survival. Killing every single mass is the only way to remove the life form.<br/><br/>Infestation: Upon sensing the proximity of a living creature, the tendrils will snare the beast and burrow in through available orifices (mouth, nose, ears and other) and then sprout spur-like hooks to anchor the tendrils to its host. Once the spurs have fastened themselves, the tendrils die and fall off and the infestation can truly begin. Short of radical, invasive surgery done before the tendrils detach, there is no way to halt this process. The spurs release spores into the bloodstream which travel throughout the body and blossom into a secondary nervous system. Once the spine and brain have been supplanted by this "nerve tree," the host is effectively taken over. The entire process takes a few hours to complete and the host is placed into a vegetative state while it occurs. Pod People are, in simple terms, mobile tendril/mass clusters remotely connected to other human hosts via their nerve trees. For some reason, other forms of animal life do not possess this ability and die quickly after infestation as their nervous systems are overwhelmed by the invading alien life form. Pod People reproduce like their birth pod and maintain a rough telepathic awareness of other Pod People. They prefer sleeping victims as they are easier to subdue... such a victim is infested often without even disturbing their slumber.<br/><br/>Behavior: Pod People have no consciousness but inhabit the thoughts and desires of their hosts. In other words, they do not "want" anything other than to expand their neural network. They can be said to "want" to kill, subdue and infest because that is how their hosts react to their presences. Pod People have no emotions or memories apart from their human hosts and like bad puppeteers can be clumsy in how they manipulate their hosts' abilities (for example, a Pod Person who was a police officer will have a skewed version of the law, right, and wrong and will ultimately use that knowledge to further the Pod People agenda). Pod People can actively "ping" one another in time of danger or urgency by emitting an unearthly scream. Otherwise, their telepathic natures are passive and subtle. Their screeches are immediate, transmitting a vital and blunt message instantaneously via sound but also echoed throughout their neural web. These reverberate throughout the Pod People's network, eventually reaching every single member regardless of proximity to the sound.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the Pod People's goal is to expand their neural web to cover the entire planet and eventually, the entirety of the Universe. Speculation by researchers who destroyed the main mass in Venezuela posit that the destruction of their home planet was caused by a last ditch effort to prevent this spread to other worlds by a doomed, moral and alien species.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
