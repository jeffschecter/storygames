He actually urged others to post their own, but since this is a pretty challenge-heavy forum, I thought I'd bring that challenge to the forefront.<br/><br/>The challenge is simple:<br/><br/><b>Design a role-playing poem - that is, a 15-minute role-playing game. It must take no more than 15 minutes from start to finish, including reading the rules.</b><br/><br/>The role-playing poem is a very versatile form, especially suited for exploring situations, themes or concepts that aren't well-suited for a whole evening of play. Some are absurd, some experiential, some silly and some artsy. You can see some examples <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/category/role-playing-poems/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/><br/>[EDIT] <br/><br/><div><br/><b>Competition rules</b><br/><br/>The challenge ends on June 20. At that time, a jury of Norwegians (picked by me) will select the Bestest Role-Playing Poem. <br/>The criteria will be: Fun, originality, and adherence to the form (bloated monstrosities lasting 20 minutes or more, for example, will have a hard time winning). <br/>The winner will be announced here at Story Games, and on the N\xf8rwegian Style website. <br/><b>The award: A bar of Firkl\xf8ver, most Norwegian of all chocolate!</b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://hagerup.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/firklover.jpg"/></div><br/><br/>[/EDIT]                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145115/#Comment_145115" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T11:56:23+00:00" title="May 20, 2008 11:56AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're on, Norwegian!

Read these rules for all to hear, before starting the poem.<br/><br/>The players are friends going on a wilderness trek togehter, staying the nights at open cabins.<br/><br/>Use your own names, but let all other facts and relations in the poem be fiction. Keep that in mind and play for fun.<br/><br/><b>START</b><br/>Sit down in a circle. Take of shoes and stockings, and place them in front of you, for all to see, in the center of the circle. It is important that all players have naked feet in this game. I know it may make you nervous, but you have to dare it. Please!<br/><br/>Choose a timekeeper. He/she note the time. The poem is to last for 15 minutes. <br/><br/><b>THE SONG</b><br/>Find a song all of you know, and sing the first verse of it. This is your "wilderness-song". You will end all scenes in the poem by singing this around the fire of a cabin. Each time you sing this song the day ends (and a night goes by before the next scene).<br/><br/><b>THE SCENES</b><br/>Each scene in the poem symbolizes one day on your trek in the woods and/or mountains. You play as many scenes as time allows. All scenes will consist of two major elements: nature and footwear. You start the scene with a dialogue on nature, then it shifts into a dialogue on footwear, and it ends by all of you singing the wilderness-song. Anyone may initiate the shifts of the scene, and all must adhere to the shifts.<br/><br/><b><i>- Nature: </i></b>all comments on the scenery should be positive, describing how you experience the landscape and/or the weather, letting the other characters know in which way you enjoy it. Follow up on comments: if one player say it rains, then you may comment on how the rain washes you face, or how droplets drop from the branches. Be positive! Communicate enjoyment! <br/><br/><b><i>- Footwear: </i></b>all comments on shoes/socks should reveal some truth about your relationship to the man/woman whose footwear you comment on. These relationships may be troublesome or positive, or both, and you may initiate romance. Your relationships may change and develop during this part of the dialogue, but remember to keep all comments related to footwear in some way.<br/><br/><b>THE FINAL</b><br/>When the timekeeper announces that it is time to end the game, you will play the final. Start with the timekeeper, and go clockwise around the circle. One by one you will stretch out and take hold of two feet, and make an announcement. Each player will do this in turn. When it is your turn, you may do the friendship or the romantic final.<br/><br/><i><b>- Friendship:</b></i> grab one foot each of two players, and tell them how your friendship with them deepens due to this wilderness trek. Look them in the eyes, smiling, while doing this. Let go of the feet to end your announcement.<br/><br/><i><b>- Romantic:</b></i> grab both feet of one player, and tell him/her that the two of you become lovers/sweethearts/spouses after the trek. Look the player in the eyes, smiling, when doing this. Let go of the feet to end your announcement.<br/><br/>When all have had their final, you sing the wilderness-song, and the poem ends. Give some hugs and thanks, and go wash your hands.<br/><br/><i>Have a nice trek!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145257/#Comment_145257" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T05:27:58+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  5:27AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 17, 2008 6:33PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>AFTERNOON DELIGHT</b><br/>By Jason Morningstar<br/><br/><b>HOW TO PLAY</b><br/>This poem requires three players.  Read the character descriptions and choose who will play who.  Set up a couch or bench and sit ANGELA and BETTY on it.  DUNBAR should be in the next room with his timeline and a watch.  DUNBAR\u2019s job is to start the scene, call stuff out at the appropriate times, and end the scene.  ANGELA and BETTY can do whatever they want.<br/><br/><b>CHARACTER DESCRIPTIONS<br/><br/>BETTY</b><br/>It\u2019s a hackneyed story \u2013 grad student falls in love with prof\u2019s mind, prof falls in lust with grad student\u2019s body, cue the violins.  That was your story.  He used to tell you stories of his wife \u2013 some harridan more in love with her job than with her husband, preferring a marriage as dead as dirt over setting him free.  A cruel woman.   James  was an indifferent lover but oh, that brain of his.  The phrases he turned.  They were a powerful aphrodisiac.  Maybe too powerful \u2013 an hour ago you accidentally reverse-cowgirled him to death.  <br/><br/><b>ANGELA</b><br/>You knew there was somebody, and that it would end badly, but you\u2019d always thought he\u2019d have better taste.  A cheap motel?  One of his research assistants?  Heart failure during sex?  Which part is the most humiliating, and which is the most hurtful?  So many questions, layered like the blackest comedy on top of even blacker grief.  Because you loved James, despite his flaws, despite his arrogance, despite, well, everything.  He didn\u2019t deserve to die, but his heart was as weak as the rest of him.   At least the police had the decency to call you before sanitizing anything.  <br/><br/><b>DUNBAR</b><br/>You\u2019ve seen this before and it is pretty awkward.  Citizen indulges in a little illicit slap-and-tickle and pops a gasket in a seedy motel, leaving a bunch of people to pick up the pieces.  Including, unfortunately, you.  Officer on the scene, waiting for a fucking homicide detective to come check this one off as accidental, lab guys in to take some photos, then the meat wagon.  There goes your afternoon.  At least it\u2019ll make a funny story later.<br/><br/><b>DUNBAR\u2019S SCRIPT<br/><br/>START</b><br/>Tell the two women to sit tight, somebody is on the way to ask them some questions.  The lab guys need to finish taking some photographs and a homicide detective needs to visit the scene before the ambulance arrives.  Nothing to worry about.  Five minutes, tops.  Leave the room but remain within ear-shot.  <br/><br/><b>TWO MINUTES</b><br/>Supervise the lab techs without leaving the room.  If you have a camera, use the flash a few times.  Help them roll the corpse over after they get the photos they need, zip him into a bag.  <br/><br/><b>FOUR MINUTES</b><br/>Have a heated exchange via radio without entering the room.  Explain to your sergeant that you\u2019re stuck waiting on some Homicide guy at the Star-Lite Motel, that a citizen\u2019s laying there dead with a condom dangling from his Johnson while his wife and girlfriend are sitting there.  Yeah, both.  Yeah, lucky guy, right, not a bad way to go.  <br/><br/><b>SIX MINUTES</b><br/>Stick your head out and offer the women some coffee from the in-room coffee machine.  Apologize for the wait.  <br/><br/><b>EIGHT MINUTES</b><br/>Without entering the room, have another conversation via radio, this time with the homicide detective.  Explain the situation with some profanity mixed in, tell him you\u2019ve been waiting all day, you\u2019ve got some distraught citizens waiting, answer some fairly specific questions about the state of the body and how it got that way.  Promise you\u2019ll write it all up.  <br/><br/><b>TEN MINUTES</b><br/>Enter the room and apologize to the two women.  Tell them you\u2019ve got their names, addresses, and statements, and that they are free to go.  Tell them James will be taken to the county coroner\u2019s office as soon as possible.  Apologize for the delay.  Leave.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Santtu" title="Santtu"><img alt="Santtu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Santtu">Santtu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145406/#Comment_145406" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T01:05:25+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  1:05AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in!

Well, now that this competition has been announced, we'd better go through with it - although it does seem like Jason is going to have an easy time of it - if Santtu doesn't post something, that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145905/#Comment_145905" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-24T22:31:43+00:00" title="May 24, 2008 10:31PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wait, does that mean I shouldn't finish and upload my roleplaying poem, in an attempt to win a chocolate bar?<br/><br/>Because I love chocolate.

The reason I created this genre/form/thingy is that ordinary role-playing games tend to shun certain moods or scenes. This is done by good reason, usually. A lot of ordinary moods and scenes of a human life are not suited for an ordinary role-playing game. Still I believe that many of these moods may be interesting to sniff at, and have created <i>role-playing poems </i>to facilitate that.<br/><br/>The game <i>\u201cStoke-Birmingham 0-0\u2033</i> is an example of how the poetic idea of these games may be promoted. My very first play session with this game created 15 minutes of sore and anxious mood with surprising depth. The players all experienced that their head got heavier and their backs more bent during the game. The lack of energy in the characters dominated the players and their interaction. It made for a strong experience.<br/><br/><i>Role-playing poems </i>are very simple to write. A set-up for 15 minutes of play is all you need. The very first time I wrote RP-poems I wrote three. One day after posting the idea on the web, three more designers had made their first poems. The simplicity of it makes it ideal for both novice and experienced gamedesigners. For the novice it is a great experience to actually <span style="text-decoration: underline;">finish</span> a full game design, to see players enjoy it, and to get the feedback. For the old fox it is a great way to experiment with any novel idea of games design, or to play around a bit more than in ordinary design.<br/><br/>That's how I understand role-playing poems. Don't limit yourself to my meagre understanding of it. Go kill some illusions!<br/><br/>Yours sincerely, Tomas HV M\xf8rkrid                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145932/#Comment_145932" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T09:38:32+00:00" title="May 25, 2008  9:38AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in, but I have to finish a course I'm taking, so the June 20th deadline will be fantastic.

I'm not sure if this one fits under the time limit, as I've done zero playtesting.<br/><br/><b>The Thousand Dark Young</b><br/><br/>Deal out an entire deck of standard playing cards evenly amongst the players.<br/><br/>Each player writes down three Fears that define their character. These are kept secret. The character must also have a name and a job description, which are public. All characters are citizens of the City, and are all in the Nightclub when the Thing arises.<br/><br/>All players describe scenes of horror, terror, fright, etc. that drive the characters towards an eventual confrontation with the Thing From Beyond. Each sentence you speak allows you to play a card. The player with the Ace of Spades goes first.<br/><br/>Cards must be played in Uno style, matching the last card in suit or number. Jokers are wild and are never "set" to a specific value or suit. If you can no longer play, you may choose to pick up the current top card and stop speaking, or be Devoured, leaving the game and taking your cards with you in a final terrible scene. In either case, play passes to the left. <br/><br/>All scenes should drive towards the ending, wherein a veritable horde of Horrible Creatures from Beyond eat the city and everyone in it. When in doubt as to what to do, add unnecessary creepy description to something important, or describe what a character does in reaction to something you've mentioned, and keep play moving. The core of the game is what happens to your characters and how they react when forced into this situation with each other and without their loved ones.<br/><br/>If you describe a character's Fear, her player may put down a card right then and describe a brief reaction. Multiple fears can come up at once for multiple characters, with every player involved putting down a card if able. If you can, play an extra card as and describe the awful stuff that happens to the character, which stops somewhere short of killing her. Perhaps it's just a little scare, perhaps she loses an arm. Cross off Fears as they occur, so that none are brought into play more than once.<br/><br/>Whomever "goes out" first (gets rid of her entire hand) is the last to be devoured. She may narrate, for one final minute, the horrific deaths of the other investigators before it all goes black.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145973/#Comment_145973" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-25T19:58:22+00:00" title="May 25, 2008  7:58PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Tomas!

One player is the Caves, another is the Whimsical Hand of Fate, and the rest of the players are Heroes.  You may need a large number of Heroes.<br/><br/>First, put fifteen tokens into a pile marked "challenge", and give ten tokens to each Hero.<br/><br/>The game begins with the Caves player describing the first room in the caves.  There should be some kind of challenge in the room, like "a horde of angry orcs" or "a fiendish trap".  The Caves player should outline the nature of the challenge, describe it with some detail, and two to four choices about possible responses to the challenge.  Each choice should be numbered.  <br/><br/>For example:<br/>Challenge: A horde of ravening orcs:<br/>1. Wave your torch at them, hoping to scare them away with the light.<br/>2. Draw your blade and engage them in battle.<br/>3. Flee through the jagged rocks.<br/>4. Attempt to negotiate.<br/><br/>The Whimsical Hand of Fate must write down two numbers - one which is the "right" answer, and one which is the "really wrong" answer.  The WHoF must also secretly bid a number of tokens from the "Challenge" pool.<br/><br/>The Heroes then must all make their choice about which option to take.  They may argue "in character" about which choice to take, or try to split the group between the options.  Once they've all decided, and written down their choice, the WHoF reveals the "right" answer.<br/><br/>Anyone who chose the "right" answer doesn't lose any tokens.  These players may narrate their success briefly.<br/>Anyone who chose a "wrong" answer loses as many tokens as bid by the WHoF.  They may narrate how their hero barely survives (or dies) as a result of their choice.<br/>Anyone who chose the "really wrong" answer loses double the number of tokens bid.  They may narrate the devastating consequences of their choice.<br/><br/>If any player loses their last token, their Hero is dead, and they must narrate this.<br/><br/>Finally, the Caves player nominates one player who gave the best or most interesting narration, that was truest to the Caves' imagination of the scene.  That player regains three tokens.<br/><br/>Repeat until the WHoF is out of tokens, or all the Heroes are dead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_146000">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146000/#Comment_146000" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T05:47:16+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  5:47AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2008 5:49AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason: I understood as much, but I see the third player as a puppet (not much fun in it).

I thought about a few different ways of doing it, like the WHoF lays down a playing card and you've gotta match the suit, and things like that, but in the end I thought you'd always want to write it down.  If it were only two choices each time that would be fine, but with four it's harder to remember.  <br/><br/>I think it's important that the WHoF is not random.  There'll be some pattern that the player is using, some criteria, probably what they find most amusing.  The players are guessing that, not just random numbers (though close to it).  They're also guessing what the Caves' player is going to like, so they're kinda being pulled in two directions, which is something I try to do in all my game designs.<br/><br/>You're right that the writing is a bit much though, and I think the game would only get through two or three iterations in fifteen minutes, whereas you probably need four or five, maybe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/willem" title="willem"><img alt="willem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/willem">willem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146040/#Comment_146040" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T13:16:03+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  1:16PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My entry:<br/><br/>HOSPITALITY FAMILY SHOWDOWN<br/><br/><b>Host vs. Guest</b><br/><br/>Pick two sides, randomly or let them self-organize.

I'm with Tomas though, in thinking that the way it's written up is a little confusing.  I think there's a tension between how the rules text emphasises competition ("Goals", "teams", "capitulate"), and the fact that there's no actual competition in the rules of the game (no actual way to win or lose).  I think that might be a problem with the design in general - the unresolved tension between competition and creation.  That's partly my own taste in gaming speaking though.<br/><br/>I'm really enjoying reading these.  I think they're really good for isolating a single type of design or mechanic, and showing the effect of that in isolation.  Very educational!<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, please expect "Hero Caves!

Hello everyone!<br/><br/><br/><b>Boredom</b><br/><br/>Choose the most boring person to read the rules. This is boring.<br/><br/>This is a game for 5 or more people. It lasts for 15 minutes.<br/><br/>The sole purpose of this game is to make you feel bored.<br/><br/><i>The setting:</i><br/><br/>It's Saturday night. Party night. You all agreed to meet but didn't establish what you should do. You feel the evening pass by slow. Very slow. <br/>You all have suggestions on what to do. They are all boring, or just not good enough. <br/><i><br/>The game:</i><br/><br/>In the game all players make suggestions on what to do. The most boring player starts. After a suggestion everyone should be quiet for about 30 seconds. <br/>When you are quiet try not to do much. Play with your cellphone (it's boring). Read covers on boring books. Try to find a stain on your shirt. Avoid eye contact. <br/><br/>When the time has passed all the other players should come up with reasons to why they don't want to do the activity. Maybe it's to expensive, to far away or the place is closed. <br/><br/>After this have one minute of quiet, then the next person makes a suggestion. Have the "suggestion, quiet, answer, quiet, suggestion" round for the rest of the game. <br/><br/><i>Dying of boredom:</i><br/><br/>It you feel the boredom is too much you can choose to die. Don't make a big fuzz. Even dying is boring.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends after 15 minutes or if all players have died from boredom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/der.hobbit" title="der.hobbit"><img alt="der.hobbit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/der.hobbit">der.hobbit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146111/#Comment_146111" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T05:16:25+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  5:16AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2008 5:32AM by der.hobbit.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>The Conquest</b><br/>\n<br/>\nThe Conquest is an RPG poem about an epic battle between good and evil. Well, as epic as you make it. In this game there are five fixed scenes, which last two minutes each. Every scene has a fixed topic and is narrated by one of the players.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Preparations</i><br/>\nTo play this RPG poem, you need some kind of game money (poker chips, monopoly money) and an egg-timer (2 min).<br/>\nHand every player the same amount of money.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Playing one scene</i><br/>\nAs mentioned above, each scene is narrated by one player. It is decided by bidding which player has the right to narrate, i.e. the topic is announced and every player may bid some or all of his money to be the narrator of the following scene. The bidding continues until one player placed the highest bid and none of the other wants to surpass him.<br/>\nHe then has two minutes (measured by the egg-timer) to narrate according to the topic. The other players may not interrupt him. After the time is finished, the narrator has to stop immediately and all the others rate his narration as being disastrous (-2), bad (-1), average (0), good (1) or excellent (2). The points are added up and written down. If the same player narrates more often than once during the course of the game, his values are added up.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>The scene progression</i><br/>\n<br/>\nThe progression of scenes is as follows:<br/>\n1) The Evil - Describe the evil. What is it? Where does it come from? How does it affect the world?<br/>\n2) The Hero - Describe the hero. How was he/she affected by the evil? Why should he be willing (or not) to fight the evil? What are his special abilities?<br/>\n3) The Confrontation - How do Hero and Evil clash for the first time? Why is the Evil not overcome (which it is not, we have some rounds to go yet!) How do Evil and Hero change due to this clash?<br/>\n4) The Weakness - What is the weakness of the Evil, and how does the Hero find out about it?<br/>\n5) The Attack - How does the Hero use the Weakness to finally overcome the Evil? How does he obtain all neccessary items to do so, how does he come close enough to the Evil?<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter these scenes are told, the highest rated player (concerning the rating from disastrous to excellent) may narrate the ending:<br/>\n6) The Victory - How does the Hero overcome the Evil? How does he continue his life? What does he do with the spoils of war?<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Summary</i><br/>\n1) Hand out money, start with the first scene.<br/>\n2) Bid for the narration-rights of the current scene.<br/>\n3) The highest bidder narrates for two minutes.<br/>\n4) He is rated for his narration by all other players.<br/>\n5) Continue at 2) with the next scene, until the fifth scene is told.<br/>\n6) The player with the highest rating narrates scene 6.<br/>\n<br/>\nEnjoy!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_146112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146112/#Comment_146112" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-27T05:21:04+00:00" title="May 27, 2008  5:21AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2008 5:21AM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Boredom:</b> I like the idea of simulating the gang that do not find anything to do a saturday night.

It's love at first sight... now what?<br/><br/>There are five roles in this RPG Poem. Two of the players need to play the two lovers. The third player will play the friend, the drunk, and the business man. Props will be used to distinguish which role the third player is currently playing. Grab a bottle for the drunk, and a briefcase or cellphone for the business man. The exact prop used is unimportant, as long as all of the players know which role each one represents.<br/><br/><i>The Lovers</i><br/>Take a moment to decide on the details of the lovers. Ask some simple questions that will help you to get a basic feeling for these characters. What are the genders of the two lovers? How old are they? Don't spend more than five minutes getting a feel for the characters. Revealing details in the scene, can be more fun than making them up ahead of time.<br/><br/><i>The Friend, The Drunk, and The Business Man</i><br/>The friend, the drunk, and the business man exist to introduce complications for the interactions of the lovers. When you are holding the prop for a role, then you are currently playing that role. Put the props to full use, take swigs from the bottle, or talk loudly on the cellphone. <br/><br/>The friend role has no prop, so when you aren't holding the bottle or the briefcase/cellphone, than this is the role that you are playing. You can decide whose friend you will be before the scene starts, or you can wait until play begins. If you decide to wait until play starts, be sure to make your choice very clear in your first few statements.<br/><br/><i>Playing the Scene</i><br/>The scene begins just after the lovers have first noticed each other. Play proceeds with each player acting out what their characters say and do. After ten minutes, one of the lovers needs to get off of the subway. The scene and the game ends at this point.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_146505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146505/#Comment_146505" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T15:30:01+00:00" title="May 28, 2008  3:30PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>A Moment on the Subway:</b> Wow!

Talk to that greater thing about the good things that have happened today, and think about how they came about. Say thanks if you want to.<br/>2. Tomorrow morning, when you wake up, find that greater thing again. Talk to it about the day that will come and the things you will do.<br/>3. At some point during the day tomorrow, bring about a good thing - something you know you will be thankful for in the evening. Afterwards, send a little sign of happiness to the greater thing.<br/><br/>The greater thing you use can be anything. A belief system. A god. A political system. A common soul.

There are orcs, gnomes, dwarfes, elves and humans. It is not necessary to chose the same race.<br/>\nThen add five facts or locations to your world.<br/>\n<i>Examples: a huge dark forest, a necropolis, the warmage's army is coming...</i><br/>\n<b><br/>\nSecond Chapter: Falling in love</b><br/>\nAfter the elder player has chosen head or tails, flip a coin to decide who starts. The beginning player tells where the story begins, where, when and why the characters met and how his/her character falls in love with the other.<br/>\nThe other player does the same, when the first finished.<br/>\n<i>Examples: Once upon a time there was a young orcish lad and a beautiful human girl, it was a warm midsummer day and the winds were blowing through the leaves of the big tree standing in the middle of the market place, when their eyes met...</i><br/>\n<b><br/>\nThird Chapter: Only problems</b><br/>\nBut love's not easy! In this chapter, the other player begins, and describes all the problems his/her characters love will provoke in his enviroment/family/race/folk/faction, what they will do and how s/he will react.<br/>\nThe second player is doing the same in turn.<br/>\n<i>Examples: Think about Romeo and Juliet!</i><br/>\n<b><br/>\nForth Chapter: The disaster</b><br/>\nFlip a coin to decide the beginning player for this chapter. The first player describes a fantasy-typical epic catastrophe, that threats and changes the whole world, especially the factions/folk/families of our characters. Introduce the menace, first consequences and how the world react.<br/>\nThe other player frames a concrete scene during the chaos of the disaster, where the two characters met and have to interact with each other. This is scene has to end in a cliff-hanger!<br/>\n<i>Examples: A dragon awakes, burns the city and haunts all virgins, the shadow-orcs are coming over the mountains and plunder everything, during the earth-quake caused by the giants meeting, one of the two characters is about falling down a bridge, the other character is coming to help, slips and is now hangig also down the bridge, when suddenly a giant is standing under them...</i><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Last Chapter: Resolution (Happy End?)</b><br/>\nFlip a coin: Head will mean love, happiness a happy end for the story, tails says more disaster, hate, desperation, death or whatever you find adequate for the ending of your little love affair.<br/>\nFlip another coin to decide who is going to tell all this. S/he has to continue where the last scene has ended and to tell the big final!<br/>\nAfterwards, the other player holds the epilogue and narrates what's happening with the world.<br/>\n<i>Examples: ...and they lived happily ever after. </i><br/>\n<br/>\nTHE END<br/>\n-<br/>\nsorry for the long examples, so much fun!<br/>\n<br/>\nmy favorite is orcology! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\nand the thing where you have to touch each others feet! <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The Role-playing Poem Challenge - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6545/the-role-playing-poem-challenge/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="The Role-playing Poem Challenge - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/6545/the-role-playing-poem-challenge/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="This is my entry for The Role-playing Poem Challenge.

A story about the wedding, about the engagement, about life, about love, about death, about family, about kids, about why this ring can't just be replaced.<br/><strong>You Must:</strong> Find the ring.<br/><strong>On Each Minute:</strong> The Ring Placer picks one player and calls out, "[Player's Name], have you found it?" The player then tells a quick story about loss. If divorced, it must be about the loss of their marriage. If married, it must be about the loss of the past and how the relationship has changed. No more than 30 seconds. This must be loud enough so all players can hear it. After ten minutes of searching, stop.<br/><strong>After Searching:</strong> Everyone comes together and sits in silence while thinking about loss. The Ring Placer reads the haiku from above, and then hugs each player one at a time. After this, the players can hug each other.<br/><strong>If the Ring is Found:</strong> Rejoice. The Ring Placer reads the haiku from above, and then opens a bottle of red wine and all celebrate with cheers to the Ring Placer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148898/#Comment_148898" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T19:01:17+00:00" title="June  8, 2008  7:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            this is a very beautiful idea.<br/>do you wish for each person to put in only one entry?<br/>i feel like i have a few good ideas.<br/><br/>i will certainly do at least one, i am very excited about everyone's games!<br/><br/>thanks,<br/>-jackson                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_148923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148923/#Comment_148923" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-08T22:31:42+00:00" title="June  8, 2008 10:31PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NO need to limit yourself to only one idea, Jackson.

Children will be children. To break you of your childhood, the master monks have given you a plate of peas to count while blindfolded. You'll spend the day counting peas in order to break you of your childhood.<br/><br/><b>Set-up</b>: Get a timer that ticks and set it for 15 minutes. For each player, fill a bowl full of dried beans, peas, or something like that and give it to them, and wrap a blindfold around their eyes. Wrap them in a blanket made to look like a robe. Sit the players on the floor, cross legged, in a circle.<br/><br/><b>To play</b>, for fifteen minutes the players must loudly hum \u201cOhm Ohm Ohm Ohm,\u201d and throw peas at each other. When a player's plate is empty of peas, they must feel around on the ground for peas to throw. At no point may the players stop humming \u201cOhm Ohm Ohm Ohm.\u201d If a player has to converse while looking for peas, the player may vary the pitch and sound of the "Ohm Ohm Ohm Ohm."<br/><br/>Once fifteen minutes is up and the alarm goes off, the players stop exactly where they are and someone removes the blindfold.

Are they going to be friendly?<br><br>WHY DO YOU BELIEVE?<br><br>Whoever has the longest hair should go first.<br/><br/>Take no more than two minutes and explain why your character believes in UFOs.  It can be as simple as some strange lights you saw in the sky; or as complicated as an alien abduction where you were scientifically experimented on.  But be as descriptive and emotive as possible.  What did it feel like to you?  How were you affected by the experience?<br/><br/>It helps if you base your character's experience on something that really happened to you as a person.  Perhaps a weird experience or dream that you had, or a secret fear or question you have.  Try to make it personal.<br/><br/>While the first player is describing their belief, the other players should be writing down single words or phrases they hear that are evocative to them.  For example, you might write down "light gray skin" or "spinning lights" or "scared out of my wits".<br/><br/>If the describing player takes longer than two minutes, the player to their right should gently remind them to finish up.<br/><br/>After the first player is finished, go clockwise around the table.  Every player should have two minutes to describe why they believe.  Everyone who is not talking should continue taking notes of what is interesting to them.<br/><br/>Note that you do not need to incorporate the notes you have taken when it is your turn to describe.  Keep those notes for later.<br/><br/>A PAUSE<br/><br/>After the last player is done describing their experience, everyone should take a full 60 seconds to reflect.  Don't look at your notes or talk to the other players.  Just sit quietly and think about the arrival of the aliens.  The player who spoke last can gently note when the time for reflection is finished.<br/><br/>THE ARRIVAL<br/><br/>The youngest player at the table should announce the arrival of the aliens.  Don't think too much.  Just say what is in your head, and use the notes that are in front of you.  Say only a few sentences, and then stop talking and look directly at another player.<br/><br/>The player who was looked at should take up directly from that sentence and continue talking, trying always to bring in the notes that they took.  When they are finished they will stop and look at a third player.<br/><br/>This should continue until each player has had the chance to talk at least two or three times.  <br/><br/>The DEPARTURE<br/><br/>Then all of the players should close their eyes.<br/> <br/>Each player should hold out their arm straight in front of them, bring careful to not touch others.  Hold your hand palm up if you choose to go with with aliens.   Hold your hand palm down if you choose to stay on Earth.<br/><br/>When all players are done, everyone should open their eyes and see who has left and who stayed behind.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151251">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151251/#Comment_151251" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-17T18:32:05+00:00" title="June 17, 2008  6:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello!

Nice to see a spouse getting excited about the RPGs of her nerdy husband ;-)<br/><br/>I expect games like these; simpler and with more variety in themes, to be of greater interest to the general public, maybe greater than the interest among gamers, actually.<br/><br/>These games are widening our scope of what a game really is.

Don't refer to it during the poem, just take what you remember and go with that.<br/>The two players are out of their houses, ideally together, somewhere. They enjoy themselves (again, ideally) and before parting ways to return home they decide on three things- 1) what time to begin play, 2) what time to make a phone call, ideally 7-9 minutes after play begins, and 3) which of them will be the caller.<br/>Then the players synchronize their watches and go home.<br/><br/><br/>The Poem<br/>Play will begin when you are outside of your home and somewhere out there your fellow player is outside of their home. You stand outside, a little ways off. You keep glancing at your watch. When the selected minute turns over and play begins, you transform. You become the poetic ideal of a thief, methodical, cautious, infallible; carefully wearing the perfect disguise. You look exactly like a person who lives in this building here, this building you are about to break into.<br/><br/>Hang around for a few more minutes, out on the street, making sure no one is watching; try to move like the person you're disguised as. When it's clear, go up to the door, take out the copies of keys that you've made and keep trying until you find the one that works.<br/><br/>Then walk on in.<br/><br/>Try to quickly get a feel for the layout of the house. So this is the living room, there, down the hall- is that the bathroom? And regard the objects with your measured gaze. All of these things, from the furniture down to the pen beside the telephone, all of it was brought here by someone, selected among others of its kind using some particular criteria. Can you fathom that criteria? And does your quarry live with others? You don't know. Are there themes among the objects which would insinuate multiple dwellers, insinuate multiple decorators?<br/><br/>No time to lose. Remind yourself of your goal, and begin searching. Explore, and sweep the rooms with an appraising eye. you are not here for DVDs, nor jewelery, nor laptop computers; though these things may tempt you. Seeking understanding, move from room to room. The bathroom, the kitchen. Seek to understand. If there are multiple bedchambers, quickly rule out the ones which have a discrepancy in them. Your quarry does not pretend to be other than they are, unlike yourself. Select one and go in. Look around. Time is getting on and so you must find the place in the house which most strongly represents your quarry. Go there.<br/><br/>Stand in the middle and look carefully, touching nothing. Someone actually lives like this. All of these objects were selected and brought here, and arranged by those hands. Why is that thing sitting there, when it so obviously belongs somewhere else? Hazard a guess. Make it up. There's no way to know for sure. <br/><br/>So somewhere here, maybe hidden from view but soon to be revealed is the object most like your quarry, the single thing which represents them completely and exactly. Begin your search gently, then move with more passion. You must find it!<br/><br/>But keep an eye on your watch! You're expecting a call, or you must make one. In either case, get to the phone early. Hang around, making sure the line won't be in use. Apologise if someone wants to use it, be firm. This is important. If you're answering, pick it up on the first ring.<br/><br/>Here is the script for the conversation:<br/><br/>     Caller: Have you found it yet?<br/><br/>     Answerer: Not yet, but i'm close. You?<br/><br/>     Caller: The same.<br/><br/>     Answerer: We should hurry, there's not much time.<br/><br/>     Caller: There'll be enough.<br/><br/>It is important that the script is held to exactly. The thieves may stay on the line, listening to one another breathing, but no more may be said.<br/><br/>And then you hang up.<br/><br/><br/>[continued below]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_151948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/151948/#Comment_151948" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-20T13:55:13+00:00" title="June 20, 2008  1:55PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2010 5:53PM by jackson_tegu.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [continued from above]<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nImmediately get back to it. You seek to understand. What CD is in the player? What books are jumbled haphazardly? What clothes are where? What knick-knacks are displayed? Is there personal correspondence lying around? No time to read it, but scan it over. Quickly, quickly! time is running short, oh, you have to go!<br/>\nAnd just-<br/>\nJust as you really must go-<br/>\nAh.<br/>\nThere it is.<br/>\nYou pick it up, gingerly.<br/>\nYou almost can't believe it, but yes.<br/>\nHere it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nPocket it, smiling, take one last look around. Get the hell out of there. <br/>\n<br/>\nOut on the street, moving quickly, light hearted. Produce it from your pocket and study it as you go. What a strange and wondrous thing, so simple, meaning so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheck your watch. With one minute remaining on the clock, attempt to put it back in your pocket but accidentally drop it. Fail to notice that you've dropped it and walk on for five steps. At this point the thief walks out of your life forever, spin around in place and return to your skin. The character is gone and you are walking home and-<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat is that, ahead of you on the street? Isn't this thing yours? You bend to see and yes, why yes it is. How curious that it has come to be out here! Perhaps you look around, perhaps you hold it in your hand the rest of the way home. And when the time ticks all away the poem is over and you have returned to your home. You go inside to the familiar surroundings, breathe in the familiar scents. You put your things where you usually put them, pausing only a moment over the strange discrepancy of your wandering possession.

At the start of the scene, the<br/>fan leaves the authors alone with a bookshelf containing<br/>all the books that each of them have ever produced, which<br/>is quite a lot. All of the players can make up book titles<br/>and pick which in the group wrote that book, and that book<br/>will be there on the book shelf for all to comment upon.<br/>Each person picks one other author whom they love the work of,<br/>and a different one whom they think is a terrible thief who<br/>doesn't even write their own books. As the scene moves along,<br/>it is natural for the authors to begin annoying one another.<br/>Since the scene is fifteen minutes long, this can escalate a<br/>fair bit. <br/><br/>To play the scene you'll need<br/>a) some friends who want to play too<br/>b) some way to tell when fifteen minutes has passed<br/>c) some books which you don't mind getting thrown around<br/>   or perhaps even torn up a little. <br/><br/>At the end of the scene, the wealthy fan comes back and<br/>is horrified by what the celebrated authors have done to<br/>each other and their wonderful books. The authors can all<br/>see themselves through the fan's eyes and are shocked and<br/>stunned.

There are many entries, most of which are very good poems, and the jury did not agree completely at first. Some entries are simply solid pieces of work, although not quite original enough to warrant a Firkl\xf8ver. Others are extremely innovative, but seem somewhat lacking in playability and fun-factor. We have, as instructed, based our judgements on the requirements of fun, originality and adherence to form.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have interpreted fun and playability in a wide sense. Interesting, emotionally evocative, thought-provoking, beautiful, and personally challenging are all herein treated as synonyms of fun. In judging playability we have had a particular eye for strong, simple method, clear instructions and realistic timing. Some poems, we believe, stretch out certain moments of interaction beyond what will prove to be fun in actual play.<br/>\n<br/>\nOriginality has been an important deciding factor. We have looked for new method, innovative presentation and striking concepts. Innovative use of well-known method also counts as originality in our view.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdherence to form is necessarily the criterion most open to interpretation, as the form is recently developed and its boundaries are still being explored. As we see it, the here-and-now experience of moods, situations and relationships lies at the heart of role-playing poems. Too strong focus on developing narrative is usually a weakness of design, in our view, because the limited time-frame constrains the development of the story too much. In role-playing poems, narrative usually works best when it serves the experiential aspect of the poem, rather than being an end in itself. Tight, focused design with a specific (although not necessarily describable) experience in mind is another core quality of role-playing poems, as we see it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe have selected a winner, and two runners-up. Many more deserve mention; those not among the top three may rest assured that the margins were rather small. The quality is generally very high, and we hope many of these excellent poems see a lot of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst runner up:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>THE BELIEVERS</b> <i>by Chris Bennett</i><br/>\nThis poem is an excellent example of using narrative to support experience. In form it lies closer to traditional verbal role-playing than many other role-playing poems, while maintaining a very tight focus. It employs the same soft, suggestive direction of play that has proven highly effective in M. Jakobssons "Until we sink". The ending is pointed and touching. A solid design all in all, that scores a lot on fun and playability.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond runner up:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>BOREDOM</b> <i>by Lasse Lundin</i><br/>\nThis poem is drily funny right from the start ("choose the most boring person to read the rules. This is boring."), while building up its mood at the same time. It employs a strong, simple method (taking turns in suggesting an activity) which supports the main experiential goal of being bored together. It scores a lot on playability and adherence to form. It is not original enough, however, to win.<br/>\n<br/>\nWinner of the Firkl\xf8ver bar:<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>HOUSEBREAKER</b> <i>by Jackson Tegu</i><br/>\nA poem that both adheres very well to the form as well as expanding it in a new direction. The poem masterfully balances originality with playability. The use of prose to explain the game works very well. The use of synchronised timing and a phone call maintains a vital measure of interaction, and represents a new design tool that may see further use. The clever use of frantic searching helps maintain the desired state of mind. Most importantly, this poem gives the players a wonderful opportunity to interact with their own everyday lives, and to relate to it from a new angle. Housebreaker is a prime example of role-playing poetry, and a deserving winner among many other excellent poems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_156029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/156029/#Comment_156029" name="Item_100" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-11T05:41:33+00:00" title="July 11, 2008  5:41AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.
