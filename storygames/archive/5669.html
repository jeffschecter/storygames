It worked good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic idea is that a character can have <i>stakes</i> in a contest that they are not personally fighting.  They are invested in whether other people succeed or fail.  So there's "protagonist", "antagonist" and "concerned audience," or something like.  Three roles, at least.<br/>\n<br/>\nI made a resolution system that (without getting into the gory details that would overshadow the point I want to pull out) gave incentives for having stakes in someone else's conflict.  And, unsurprisingly, people tailored their behavior to get the incentives ... which got <i>really</i> interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had four players (including me as the GM) and once people got the swing of things, <i>every</i> conflict between two players had the other two players figuring out some way that their characters would have stakes in the conflict.  In our post-apocalyptic <i>Mad Max</i> wasteland, tough-girl Denise was fighting in The Pit against a big hulking blob of fat and muscle ... and the little kid who had followed her to this dangerous pass was watching, saying "She'll be okay ... she's always okay ... she's GOT to be okay!"  He was more invested in whether she lived or died than she was.<br/>\n<br/>\nI thought that was immensely fun in terms of how it made the "not-gonist" (neither protagonist nor antagonist) into an active, desirable role rather than relegating people outside the current fight to bored waiting.  What was really fascinating, though, was that people started <i>pushing</i> their fellow players into fights, specifically to create opportunities to sieze the outside staking role.  After all, it's much more fun to have somebody else striving for you than it is to strive yourself.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor a high-school game, I think that's right where we need to be.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_126991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126991/#Comment_126991" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T17:18:57+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  5:18PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds really interesting!<br><br>Some questions:<br><br>What's the incentive for having stakes in somebody else's conflict?<br><br>If I'm in a conflict, is there any incentive for <i>me</i> to draw other people in as "interested observers"?<br><br>Do the people with stakes in the conflict have any means of influencing the outcome of the contest, or is it more like placing a bet on a fighter?<br><br>Is your resolution set up so that all outcomes of conflicts are unpredictable, or is it possible to have really unbalanced conflicts, where one side is all but guaranteed to win?                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_126996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/126996/#Comment_126996" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-15T17:59:42+00:00" title="February 15, 2008  5:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roughly:  <br/><br/>(1) Your personal story is advanced in scenes where you have stakes in someone else's conflict.  <br/><br/>(2) The incentive for me to draw other people in as observers is that I take a highlight in their personal stories.<br/><br/>(3)  If their stakes are high enough then they could theoretically swamp the impact of the protagonist and antagonist, but this did not occur in play (nor do I expect it to occur often).<br/><br/>(4) It's possible to have really unbalanced conflicts, if one side comes in with way more resources than the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
