I'd like to be able to calculate the probability of what you'll pull based on the different number of each color that you put in the bag.  There will be four colors of stones, one the majority that is used as a success when it's pulled, the others in smaller numbers that will sometimes help you, or may just be a null result. <br/><br/>An example of what I'm looking at it: 10 black stones (successes), 2 white, 2 clear, 2 red. If we pull 5 stones from this set, what is the distribution of outcomes? <br/><br/>This seems to be a combination problem and I can find many, many free combination calculators online, but none that let me vary the number of the outcomes. If anyone can point me to one that does do what I want, or can explain how I can calculate this using a spreadsheet, I'd be most grateful!<br/><br/>best,<br/>Emily                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314570/#Comment_314570" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T17:36:16+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  5:36PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I bet I'm over thinking this.

In the example case, for instance, it's a simple matter to conclude that 10/16 is the likelyhood of pulling one black stone, with equivalent numbers for the other colors. However, when pulling the second stone you'll have to account for the first stone that was pulled, which means that you're now calculating the probability of a pair of stones - and while you only had one stone with one color in your first draw, to calculate the result for two stones requires you to account for all combinations of two stones that are possible - in this case, ten combinations.<br/><br/>The very simplest method for getting an acceptable approximation for this sort of calculation-heavy problem is to skip the analytical phase and use the Monte Carlo method: just put a computer to task in using the resolution system umpteenth times and then calculate the average outcome from the results to get a close approximation of the real probability. Because almost all game design works with such small sample sizes that only the largest tendencies in the probability distributions actually matter to any perceivable level, you can usually get by with a relatively short Monte Carlo test; thousand iterations, for example, will probably tell you whether the probability of something is low or high, or how changing a variable affects the results, or whatever it is you're trying to find out in a specific case.<br/><br/>How to execute a Monte Carlo run for this problem in a spreadsheet is a bit involved, but the basic idea is that you put all of your stones in one column (one stone per cell, so ten black cells, etc.), then pick a random cell from the column N times (avoiding repeats) and then output the result as a string. Once you have the function that does this in one cell, you can copy it a couple thousand times to get a column of random executions. Then just create a final function that takes this random column, sorts and counts the results and displays how many percents of the results were all black, or whatever it was that you wanted to know.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, your best bet is probably to get somebody skilled with spreadsheets to make the general case sheet for you, unless the above paragraph already told you everything you need. This is, of course, assuming that you really need to bother; not that I need to tell you this, but most of the time you don't really need exact (or even rough) probabilities in rpg design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314622/#Comment_314622" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T21:53:58+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  9:53PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Matt! I don't see any you missed. Good point about the sample size, Eero.  I'm just trying to get a general sense of things so we don't end up stiffing people. <br/><br/>I took another route. I figured out the probability of pulling a successful stone (first just black, then black plus each of the others which would correspond to a given category of task). I did the same for 5 pulls, subtracting 1 for each subsequent pull from the number of successful pulls and from the total. This isn't quite right, I realize, since doing it that way assumes that there was a successful pull each time, but it does let me see the relative strength of different combinations. There are interesting things that can come out of having low non-black, or low black and high in one of the other colors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314625/#Comment_314625" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-27T21:59:46+00:00" title="February 27, 2011  9:59PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some quick Python code to run ten million tests shows:<br/><br/><code> 11.00% BBBCW<br/> 10.99% BBBCR<br/> 10.98% BBBRW<br/>  9.62% BBBBW<br/>  9.62% BBBBR<br/>  9.62% BBBBC<br/>  8.24% BBCRW<br/>  5.76% BBBBB<br/>  2.75% BBBWW<br/>  2.75% BBBRR<br/>  2.74% BBBCC<br/>  2.07% BBRRW<br/>  2.06% BBRWW<br/>  2.06% BBCWW<br/>  2.06% BBCRR<br/>  2.06% BBCCW<br/>  2.06% BBCCR<br/>  0.91% BCRWW<br/>  0.91% BCRRW<br/>  0.91% BCCRW<br/>  0.23% BRRWW<br/>  0.23% BCCWW<br/>  0.23% BCCRR<br/>  0.05% CRRWW<br/>  0.05% CCRWW<br/>  0.05% CCRRW<br/></code><br/><br/>Interestingly, drawing only three blacks is more likely than drawing only four.

That last table really puts it all into perspective. What I'm seeing is that the majority of the time we'll get 3 black stones or more. I think that will be satisfying to players to be able to have a good chance of getting a reasonable number of successes.  And if we want to have the other colors add in, when a test is in an area that relates to what that color stone represents, the success rates would go even higher, so we might want to reduce the numbers some. <br/><br/>Thank you all so much for putting your minds to this problem. I'm grateful for the access to the tools you have for number crunching. I'll let you know how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314695/#Comment_314695" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-28T07:56:59+00:00" title="February 28, 2011  7:56AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2011 9:15AM by Wordman.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I <a href="http://thor.divnull.com/pub/code/stonesim.py" rel="nofollow">revised my code</a> and ran a number of simulations (100 thousand iterations each) using variations on the system (drawing fewer stones, using more or fewer stones, changing the ratios, etc.).

Let's say 11 black and 8 non-black. Then when drawing 5 stones, the chances you get, say, 3 black stones is 11 choose 3 (draw 3 of the 11 black stones) times 8 choose 2 (draw the remaining 5-3=2 stones from the 8 non-black, all divided by 19 choose 5 (the total number of ways to draw 5 stones from 19). Use e.g. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%2811+choose+3%29+*+%288+choose+2%29%29+%2F+%2819+choose+5%29" rel="nofollow">Wolfram Alpha</a> to calculate this. Click on that link, it makes a very pretty equation that shows what's going on well.<br/><br/>Now you've got your basic chances. In the 10 black, 6 non-black, pick 5 stones case:<br/>0 black: <b>1</b> / 728 (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2810+choose+0%29+*+%286+choose+5%29+%2F+%2816+choose+5%29" rel="nofollow">link</a>)<br/>1 black: <b>25</b> / 728 (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2810+choose+1%29+*+%286+choose+4%29+%2F+%2816+choose+5%29" rel="nofollow">link</a>)<br/>2 black: <b>150</b> / 728 (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2810+choose+2%29+*+%286+choose+3%29+%2F+%2816+choose+5%29" rel="nofollow">link</a>)<br/>3 black: <b>300</b> / 728 (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2810+choose+3%29+*+%286+choose+2%29+%2F+%2816+choose+5%29" rel="nofollow">link</a>)<br/>4 black: <b>210</b> / 728 (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2810+choose+4%29+*+%286+choose+1%29+%2F+%2816+choose+5%29" rel="nofollow">link</a>)<br/>5 black: <b>42</b> / 728 (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2810+choose+5%29+*+%286+choose+0%29+%2F+%2816+choose+5%29" rel="nofollow">link</a>)<br/><br/>(then sanity check to make sure you got all the cases: 1+25+150+300+210+42=728, so the total probability is 728/728, good)<br/><br/>If you want to see the distribution of the remaining items, look at them individually for each case you care about... for example the case where you get 2 black is probably most important 'cause once you're at 3+ you've got enough successes that the rest is just gravy, and 0 and 1 success are pretty rare so whatever. Anyway then you'd ask something like "Okay I've got 2 black, and 3 non-black, what do the non-black look like? One of each color? Two of one color, one of another? All three the same color?".<br/><br/>One of each: 2 whites choose 1 to draw, times 2 clears choose 1 to draw, times 2 reds choose 1 to draw. That's the number of ways to get one of each. Divide that by the total number of ways to draw 3 non-black stones: 6 choose 3. That's <b>2 / 5</b> (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282+choose+1%29+*+%282+choose+1%29+*+%282+choose+1%29+%2F+%286+choose+3%29" rel="nofollow">link</a>).<br/><br/>Two whites, one clear: 2 whites choose 2, times 2 clears choose 1, times 2 reds choose 0. Divided by 6 non-blacks choose 3. <b>1 / 10</b> (<a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282+choose+2%29+*+%282+choose+1%29+*+%282+choose+0%29+%2F+%286+choose+3%29" rel="nofollow">link</a>)<br/><br/>Two clears, one red: same as above. <b>1 / 10</b>.

Because they usually force you to get a ref to interpret the results for you.<br/><br/>One of the biggest strengths of LARP is that it's possible to do so much without needing to route it through a ref. If you want to talk to a character, you talk to them. If you want to sit down, you sit down. You don't need to route these things through a ref to make them real.<br/><br/>And the best LARP mechanics are usually those that don't need a ref to help administer them.<br/><br/>There's a good reason, for example, that the majority of people HATE how combat works in Mind's Eye Theatre. It is complicated and slow and makes you stop doing your in-character communicating in order to deal with the mechanics and route all of your actions through a ref - potentially for hours! It's basically a tabletop strategic combat system slightly streamlined so that it can be done standing up. <br/><br/>When I read about pulling stones from a bag, I fear that you may be crafting something similar. This may not be a problem. You may be coming up with a brilliant system that doesn't require any ref interpretation.<br/><br/>But, as an uninformed suggestion that comes from a place of not knowing what game you are working on and not knowing what sort of mechanics you are trying to accomplish:<br/><br/>If you want to make a situation where people usually have success - consider giving people abilities that are always successful, (unless countered, perhaps). Consider giving them something that works 3 times during a session. Then, it becomes more of an issue of when to activate it, rather than whether or not it's going to work right.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, economies work better than probabilities when it comes to LARP. Give someone resources to manage, rather than a chance of success.<br/><br/>Sorry for the left field rant. Again, it may be completely unwarrented and I mean no disrespect to your mad skillz as a game designer. But, as someone who has spent a lot of time with many sorts of LARP, I wanted to put that out there as a general design suggestion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315860">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315860/#Comment_315860" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T09:14:06+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  9:14AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>When I read about pulling stones from a bag, I fear that you may be crafting something similar.

I agree with you that not having to use chance in a larp is an advantage. And I do shy away (generally) from long combats or contests. <br/><br/>This particular system though did benefit from having some mechanical weighting. It was based on Chad Underkoffler's <a href="http://www.atomicsockmonkey.com/products/di.asp" rel="nofollow">Dead Inside</a> game, in which people's soul energy is stolen and gained back again. Using chance allowed there to be some uncertainty about each of these actions, which since they determined the characters'  development and plot tragectory, was helpful. Basically, some characters where trying to gain power by stealing energy from others, while others had the ability to heal the hurt ones  back up. Having a chance of failing at each of these things, and needing to take time in between doing it once and then doing it again, was necessary for the pacing of the game and also to give the players a chance to avoid falling into the clutches of evil. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>We also used the stones themselves to represent the soul energy--so if someone succeeded in stealing your energy they also took away part of your mechanical ability by stealing a stone. This, along with a karma mechanic (inspired completely by Chad's game) where folks were rewarded for good deeds (or bad) put some real dynamics into the player interactions that enforced elements of the fiction. From the feedback we got, those were all strengths of the game.  We unfortunately miscalculated how many GMs we would need. The game had 24 players, and just 2 GMs, both of whom were having to flesh out parts of the backstory and fiction as the game went on. Sigh. This lead to at least one situation where a character got hornswoggled into something its player didn't buy into, but that I see as a matter of inadequate delineation of how an ability applied. <br/><br/>That and inexperience with writing characters, so that some were more isolated or substantially less hooked into the main plots than others were the big problems. When we revise the thing I think we'll: 1) fine tune the stones, 2) use contingency envelopes and much better descriptions of the abilities and mechanics to empower players to resolve things on their own, and 3) strengthen and add plot elements for characters with less supernatural involvement (we actually had someone very glad to be found out as a murderer, so he would be more involved in ongoing plots).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315918">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315918/#Comment_315918" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-08T13:26:37+00:00" title="March  8, 2011  1:26PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you have a strong theme-driven reason to use a randomizer. Makes sense. I especially like that it's a dynamic mechanic where other people actually take and keep your stones if they succeed.<br/><br/>Sounds like you've found the common guidelines through trial and error. Some of the basic suggestions that pregen larp designers like to throw out:<br/> - Give each character strong connections to at least 3 other characters<br/> - Give each character at least 3 goals (no more than one of which should be something relatively easy, like "find Joe and give him this note")<br/><br/>And when you have a mechanic that requires GM involvement, you want about an 8:1 ratio of GMs available specifically to administer the mechanics. Just like the way 8 players is about the most a tabletop game can handle (and most run best with about 4-5). If you have self-adjudicating mechanics, you can get away with less than that ratio. But yeah, having your documentation more fleshed out up front will help as well.<br/><br/>Sounds like a fun game. You should come out to WyrdCon in 2012 and run it there!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316062/#Comment_316062" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-09T14:53:55+00:00" title="March  9, 2011  2:53PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Rob.

But the basic mode of interaction and the role of the GM is significantly different.<br/><br/>I will be at WyrdCon, yeah. I'm going to teach the workshop class on foam sword building on Friday night. <br/><br/>Maybe next year I'll be able to run the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies game that's been floating in my head. Though I haven't even decided if it should be a live combat game or not. I like me some live combat, but I don't know if I want to have people do it in suits and ball gowns. And I don't want the game to focus all on combat and not on the social interactions. We'll see.<br/><br/>Aaron, Kirsten and Riz are awesome folks. They make me with I'd gone to UCLA, so I could have met them sooner. They will be running some great stuff at WyrdCon. It would be great if you could make it, though I understand that it's a long haul. There's a reason I've never made it to Intercon, though I've been drooling over the possibility for ages.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_317199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/317199/#Comment_317199" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-19T17:08:30+00:00" title="March 19, 2011  5:08PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: RobMcDiarmid</cite><br/>Maybe next year I'll be able to run the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies game that's been floating in my head. </blockquote>\nNow there's an idea whose time has come. \n<blockquote>Though I haven't even decided if it should be a live combat game or not.

Having someone on hand to do makeup for newly made Zombies would be fantastic. The trick would be to be able to pace the game. Some of the same issues we were dealing with here: having enough mechanics pushback to keep the big stuff from happening too fast, but with enough give to let things get terrifying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
