They are there, on your person, available when desired, but when and how you load and fire them them will be discovered during play. <br/><br/>I had several Bangs for the last <i>Sorcerer</i> session for the game I'm currently running.  One of the PCs, DAVID, is a guy who committed a murder to get to prison to kill the cult leader who ordered the death of his daughter.  Along the way he picked up sorcerous lore based on the culture of prisons (tattoos and shivs and cell blocks are demons, for example.)<br/><br/>The Bang was: <br/><br/><i>He discovers that the cult leader had an affair with his wife several years ago, the girl he thought was his daughter was actually the daughter of the cult leader.<br/></i><br/><br/>Another Bang was:<br/><br/><i>He discovers the girl who he thought was his daughter is still alive; the cult leader killed the little girl when he found out she was a demonic similicrum.  (Someone, none of the Players know who yet, made a decoy to protect the little girl!)  He needs to find the real little girl for a sorcerous ritual at the prison.  </i><br/><br/>I had another Bang:<br/><br/><i>The game is set most in a penitentiary.  The man who built the penitentiary in the 19th century is still alive in the penitentiary as a sorcerous lich and has his own agenda involving all the sorcerers in the prison.</i><br/><br/><br/>Now, I didn't know how these Bangs would hit the table.  I didn't know which PCs would discover these facts, nor where they would be revealed, or in what manner.  I just knew they were good Bangs and I looked forward to revealing them.  (For me, the best bangs are "revelations and reversals" which Aristotle assures me in <i>Poetics</i> are the best means of grabbing the audiences attention -- and I think he's right.)<br/><br/>The first two were dropped on two PCs by an NPC I was certain wouldn't even be making an appearance in the game that night.  I mean, there was so much going on already, he was on the other side of the prison, and Stubbs (the NPC I'm talking about) wasn't really on anyone's radar given all that was going on.  But one Player <i>was</i> obsessed with Stubbs (who knew) and dragged another PC into hunting Stubbs down by lying to him, and we were at the climax of the session and I thought, "Hey, maybe Stubbs know about the cult leader, the kid and the fake kid... Actually, yeah, that works." And so Bang! David is right there, I have Stubbs drop the first two Bangs.  The Players world is turned upside down.  Next session we find out what he's going to do now!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, another player is creating a riot in his cell block (his demon is the cell block and he's trying to gain more favor with the demon).  Now, I was certain the two previous players were going to have their character go down to the basement area in an effort to get across the prison - and so would find and confront Landsfield, the sorcerer lich down in the basement.  So they never went.  But when Visili started running amuck with his riot, I had Landsfield show up to smack him down.  The Players still, at that time, didn't know who he is.  But it was a big Bang to realize there was some sort of uber sorcerer lich wearing 19th century clothes who went by the same name as the prison.  They thought they knew all the major players in the prison, but now suddenly the game had changed drastically.<br/><br/><br/>In all three cases the reveals of the Bangs came from moments found on the spot and delivered for dramatic effect.  Each demands choices on the part of the Players, and each impacts the characters directly.  But I did no jiggering to get them from place another, no manipulation to get them to a certain spot to deliver the Bang.<br/><br/><br/>That's why I think the term bandolier kind of works:  I was carrying around my shotgun, three shells on my bandolier, and then, when appropriate, I grabbed one or the other, loaded and fired.<br/><br/><br/>CK                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_153336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/153336/#Comment_153336" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-27T07:47:48+00:00" title="June 27, 2008  7:47AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to add that this thread led me to read Mike's lengthy breakdown of bang types -- brilliant!

Just keep going and try another one.  Some will fizzle in play, others will work well, and the occasional one will carry a group for half a playing session.  Better to have too many that are just a sentence than a few that you put too much time into.<br/><br/>One great lesson I learned from Burning Wheel was to encourage your players to push the game in the direction that is exciting to them with suggestions and actions.  It ends up taking a lot of pressure off you as a GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
