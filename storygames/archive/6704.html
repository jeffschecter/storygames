It also has these games from other contest: Iliamna Unknown, Foe Destroyer, Blackout On the Elevator, Burning Monsters Now! with Stakes<br/><br/>Out of all the games, Pinnacle Empty Quiver, Blake Borrow, and Iliamna Unknown are the best. Although, Burning Monsters Now! with Stakes is a fun distraction of a board game.<br/><br/>I also have Q&amp;D Plastic Soldier Warfare online, which is my plastic soldier war game. It was published in Space Gamer Fantasy Gamer back in the day. The Book of Graph is also online. It made the rounds as far east as NH in the early 90s.<br/><br/>My D&amp;D hack, Taverns and Dungeons, is also there. This is a new one. I like it. I have a few other games that I don't really like, so I'm not posting them, unless anyone can suggest a value in doing so.<br/><br/>If anyone wants me to link to your site, let me know. I've linked to Simon's site. I also need a new picture for the site. I'm taking suggestions. Anyway, I thought I'd put this out there in case anyone wanted to know where the latest PEQ is resting.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.emptygamebox.com" rel="nofollow">www.emptygamebox.com</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148677">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen" title="Levi Kornelsen"><img alt="Levi Kornelsen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/788/nPXRDBAN1PRC6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Levi%20Kornelsen">Levi Kornelsen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148677/#Comment_148677" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T19:39:26+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  7:39PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hrm.

You have to click on the title of the posting or "Permalink" to get to the game or the Download link. All the download links are at the bottom of the posting. I can add a Read it Here button to the titles to help people understand that there is more to each posting. I'll also add a page that has direct links to each download.<br/><br/>I'm using a Wordpress install to run the site, so it works like a blog. A little confusing, maybe, but it cuts back on the time involved with putting something new online, so I might actually do it.<br/><br/>Thanks, for checking it out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_149134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/149134/#Comment_149134" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-09T17:00:20+00:00" title="June  9, 2008  5:00PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Brian, I missed this earlier.
