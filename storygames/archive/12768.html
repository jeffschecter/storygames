This is irrespective of whether I'm playing or GMing.<br/><br/>So far, so trad.  But there's something else I like.  The quotidian.  And that's something trad doesn't do so well.<br/><br/>What do I mean by quotidian?  I mean stuff without cool powers, I mean stuff that's about people.<br/><br/>The people don't need to be accountants and lawyers working their daily grind, I can't see any way to make that fun.  But I find something distracting in superpowers, magic, aliens and star-spanning empires because none of that is what really interests me.<br/><br/>Zombies don't for me make everything cooler.<br/><br/>What does interest me is people.  Crime dramas, political dramas, romantic dramas even.  Clients of a Roman senator doing his dirty work.  14th Century mediterranean traders trying to make a living.  1940s private eyes digging into Hollywood's seamier secrets.<br/><br/>Hm, I really didn't mean quotidian.  Oh well.  I still like the word.<br/><br/>Trad games struggle with these kinds of games because trad mechanics are (horrible generalisation coming up) about doing stuff.  Physical stuff.  But conflicts between real people mostly aren't about that, they're mostly about motives and talking people into doing what you want.  <br/><br/>What's interesting in a game about real people isn't how strong they are, or how fast they can run.  It certainly isn't how much damage they can take from a fall and still walk away.  What's interesting is what they want, why they want it and what they're willing to do to get it.<br/><br/>And that's storygames territory.<br/><br/>So, if anyone's still with me, two questions.<br/><br/>1.  Does anyone else know what I mean by quotidian gaming here?  Does anyone else feel the lure of no cool powers, no fantastic setting, just people?<br/><br/>2.  What elements in a game for you help deliver that kind of story?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287102/#Comment_287102" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T06:38:08+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  6:38AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. Absolutely.  I particularly enjoy that spot when the quotidian meets with the extraordinary.  I find the possibility of the fantastic inherent in roleplaying to be best enjoyed when viewed through the eyes of the normal.<br/><br/>2. I'm going to give you a trad solution (of which you are doubtless aware and have employed).  I think a good GM and a group who knows that they want to have a rich quotidian experience in their games can make that happen in the roleplaying without any mechanics.  <br/><br/>Sort of negatively, a game like Unknown Armies that really respects the brutality and difficulty of violence puts you in situations which seem profoundly "quotidian" or at least realistic.  The contexts tend to be fantastic though. I just played in a one-shot where we had to get a human forearm and that whole process was profoundly ugly and made me feel very quotidien, though in a pretty dark and unpleasant way (and blackly funny).  Thus the "negative" above.<br/><br/>I hear that Dirty Secrets does a great job of creating these kinds of interactions, but I have yet to play it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287105/#Comment_287105" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T06:48:31+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  6:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with 2, but some games do make it easier.<br/><br/>For example, I've run and played Dying Earth and while I thought it had some bugs (combat was a total drag to be precise) the emphasis on persuasion and succumbing to vices really drove a different sort of play.  Solutions were much less about violence (except the system slightly undermined that) and much more about talking people round.<br/><br/>Also, Heroquest I found people using relationships a lot more.  I didn't like the game's bidding mechanic, but I did play a con game once where my granny used her nagging mastery to defeat two spearmen from a rival tribe by shaming them out of attacking.  That's cool.  It's also the sort of thing actually happens on occasion in real life and drama both, with the risk being if you don't shame them you really are toast.<br/><br/>UA is a good suggestion though.  It's Ellroy the rpg in part, and the emphasis on obsessions and so on really helps underline the importance of psychological elements.  And yes, the madness meters do I imagine help.  I sold my copy because most of it was about avatars and magic and stuff that didn't interest me but the core mechanics are very nicely done.<br/><br/>I've heard good things about Dirty Secrets too.  I also own a copy of A Dirty World but haven't got to grips with it yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287106">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287106/#Comment_287106" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T06:50:34+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  6:50AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dirty Secrets is a good fit for this, the entirety of the game, from one arms-reach to the other, is about crime and covering it up, and the motives of people to do both.<br/><br/>Actually I think Smallville's core engine, in which characters have Values and Relationships might be a good fit here too.

I am way more into that than I am into magic missiles, Atlantean crystal technology or kung fu.<br/><br/>It's Complicated was literally made for this kind of play: close-to-the-ground, character-driven dramedy that explores all facets of the characters' personalities.

It's often a dial you can adjust to taste. Dogs in the Vineyard, for example, is all about moral judgment and demons exist - but your table decides if they are fire-breathing apes or just a synonym for bad luck. Turn that dial down to zero and you get a very human, very earthy experience in play (with a regular old GM, too).<br/><br/>Primetime Adventures is magnificent for dealing with regular people in ordinary but compelling situations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287118/#Comment_287118" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T07:14:54+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  7:14AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My concern with Dirty Secrets specifically is that I know the genre pretty well.

I don't mind it in part because I'm a giant genre freak and remember that at the end of the Big Sleep we still don't know who killed the cockadoody chauffeur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287132">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287132/#Comment_287132" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T08:04:34+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  8:04AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. I am absolutely with you. I mean, I like me some kewl powerz, don't get me wrong, but it's the personal stories at the heart of the bundle of stats that gets me going. I think the most extreme expression of this was the last time I played D&amp;D (3.5), I got to a point where I couldn't stand my cleric/thief hurting sentient beings, cuz (a) it wasn't something she wanted to do and (b) I thought it was wrong!<br/><br/>2. A lot of small-press games mechanize character effectiveness by the impact they have on others or the strength of their relationships to other characters. Hence the joke that Andy had up as the Story Games title for awhile "I punch him in the Hope with my Ennui." I haven't played them, but I know there's a constant "huh" when people run into Chad's PDQ games and realize that Spiderman can get punched in the girlfriend, and it hurts just as much as getting punched in the face. Anyway, about some games that I know: <br/><br/>I agree that It's Complicated is great for this. I only got to play it the once, and the group tended more towards the gonzo side, and I've been wanting to play it "straight" sometime pretty bad.<br/><br/>To be clear, Breaking the Ice and Shooting the Moon,  (and I imagine Under My Skin) are all about interpersonal relationships directly and intently. The dice rolling is pretty much about resolving whether the relationship progresses or not, and in what manner.<br/><br/>Most of my PTA play has been real-person based (investigative mysteries and domestic dramas), so here's another vote for that.<br/><br/>I will point out that my game <b>carry</b> had absolutely no supernatural elements whatsoever. It's about a squad of American marines facing the burdens they've brought with them into the Vietnam war. If you're interested I can talk some more about it, but I understand that it's not for everyone.<br/><br/>Hope some of that helps!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_287137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287137/#Comment_287137" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T08:13:35+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  8:13AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2010 8:18AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>So far, so trad.

I mean stuff without cool powers, I mean stuff that's about people.</blockquote>I have found classical rpg's to do this very well. it has to be a good classical game, of course, with more to it than overgrown mechanics (die-rolling and number-chrunching). It got to have a broad and versatile method for dealing with conflicts on many levels (including dealing with the social and mental implications of physical conflicts). I've done this a lot, and other game masters have done it too, in my classical frpg <i>Fabula</i>.<br/><br/>I believe a lot of GMs in classical rpgs have done it too, by tweaking the "rules" (making narrow mechanics into a full grown <i>method</i>). They are doing it, while still playing within the classical paradigm (character focus, GM/player-divide, etc.).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>The people don't need to be accountants and lawyers working their daily grind, I can't see any way to make that fun.</blockquote>Done that! And have had great fun with it! Working the archives can be hilarious! The option of playing clerks will be a prominent part of the new setting I am working on these days, for the new edition of <i>Fabula</i>.<br/><br/>I do not understand why classical/traditional role-playing games should be bad at doing this???\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>Trad games struggle with these kinds of games because trad mechanics are (horrible generalisation coming up) about doing stuff.  Physical stuff.  But conflicts between real people mostly aren't about that, they're mostly about motives and talking people into doing what you want.</blockquote>Ja, you are right; most classical rpgs have a surprisingly narrow focus. Taken into account how much effort that is put into them (edition after edition, rule-books a'plenty), it is highly surprising, in my view, that so little has been done in classical games to make more conflicts possible and more themes available. I really don't see how this has come to be ...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>What's interesting in a game about real people ... is what they want, why they want it and what they're willing to do to get it.<br/><br/>And that's storygames territory.</blockquote>Well ... no. Some story-games are doing it, of course, but a great deal of them make more violence, in cooler ways (faster, that is), and are more into making <i>tall tales</i> (silly and super, and totally unreal) than tales about real people.<br/><br/>Of course; I find that most story-games that <i>really do</i> the low-key stuff, does it quite nicely (sry, generalizing here). But I find that the classical variant of low-key drama is more powerful, and that <i>modern games</i> with focus on character rather than story, are more powerful in this regard too.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>1.  Does anyone else know what I mean by quotidian gaming here?  Does anyone else feel the lure of no cool powers, no fantastic setting, just people?</blockquote>I feel the lure, yes, and indulge in it as often as I can.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>2.  What elements in a game for you help deliver that kind of story?</blockquote><ol>\n<li>Grown up players! You need to have an interest in human relations and conditions, and you need an ability to see and act on nuances.</li>\n<li>Setting elements (including characters) with the right qualities to inspire believable human drama.</li>\n<li>Methodic tools to help the players realize how they may act as humans apart from themselves.</li>\n</ol>\nMy two cents.

Violence creates drama.  But the level of it is wearying.  Billy the Kid killed I think six men and is still famous.  Jack the Ripper was in single figures I think.  The average rpg character kills hundreds and hundreds of people.  I struggle to imagine what that would do to a person.  Plus, frankly, in most games nobody wants to as it would be out of genre and social contract.<br/><br/>One issue I have with shared authorship games is what I tend to call gonzo creep.  Someone introduces a gonzo element, someone else does, things get gonzo.  Most games have veto mechanics, but gonzo creep tends to be gradual and anyway vetoing something can harsh the buzz.  That said, once a psychic crops up in your PI game it's now set in a world with psychic powers and that one cool element just changed the whole setting.<br/><br/>One thing therefore I look for in shared authorship games is elements that will help create a shared vision.  Spione, although I didn't take to its core mechanic, was good at this.  Introducing a zombie or whatever would just be lame, plainly out of genre.<br/><br/>I'm familiar with Carry, it's one I'd happily play but the Vietnam war isn't one that appeals to me (it's not really my history).  Good call though, it's another way of addressing the human which is what this thread's really about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287140/#Comment_287140" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T08:21:45+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  8:21AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: D-503</cite>gonzo creep</blockquote>\nThat's definitely a known issue, and there are ways to address it. <br/><br/>In Fiasco players get on the same page by reviewing 144 setting-specific elements together and choosing 8-10 they like best to be featured in play.

They you use it to play everything you want, from a D&amp;D-like dungeon crawl to a human drama. <br/><br/>Did you ever play it?<br/><br/>--------------<br/>About the OP request, I find that a lot games not usually associated with the "real" can work well, if the group can keep the Gonzo effect in check. It's something that people lean, the first times a player play a game where he/she doesn't have to ask for anything from an all-powerful GM, they almost always go gonzo, like a child kept at school for too much when he/she can finally go out and play: he/she run screaming, and do things without any sense just because he/she finally CAN.  After a while they calm down and play improve.<br/><br/>Annalise can be played with a totally mundane "vampire" (a mobster, a corrupt politician, etc... A group of people I know played it with Nazism as the Vampire). Thou are but a Warrior turn Polaris into a game set in Spain during the Reconquest, that can be played without any fantastic element.  PTA work much better with everyday drama than with superpowers, etc.<br/><br/>If you like playing normal people in historical situations, you should really check "Montsegur 1244", too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287926">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287926/#Comment_287926" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-20T15:16:37+00:00" title="August 20, 2010  3:16PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Julia, Vincent, Shreyas and I played the most down-to-earth, subtle game of It's Complicated I've ever seen last night.
