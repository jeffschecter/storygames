                    Andy,<br/><br/>You know how awesome you are for S-G and Game Chef. I don't need to reiterate that right here.<br/><br/>That said, it appears that this forum software has a <a href="http://lussumo.com/docs/doku.php?id=vanilla:extensions&amp;s=preview" rel="nofollow">plugin extension thingy</a> to provide post previews. (PHP <a href="http://sirnot.googlepages.com/PreviewPost.php.txt" rel="nofollow">here</a>) Have you looked at this or considered this or already hashed this feature out as being too [CENSORED]-like and therefore not worthy of inclusion? Either way, just let me put a bee in your bonnet about it.<br/><br/>I can't USPS pastry at this time, as I don't know how many brownies we have left back at the apartment. Plus I think they'd taste stale by the time they reach you.<br/><br/>MDK                </div>

                            Yeah, I had a thread on it before (I might have deleted it): I installed it and had it running for three days. We discovered that all it does in this version of the forum software is <i>nothing</i>. If I recall correctly, clicking it simply doesn't do anything, which we suggested was, in fact, a surreal version of a working "preview" of sorts. But otherwise it appeared broken.<br/><br/>I'm waiting for the 1.0 version of the code, hoping it comes with one out of the box. If it doesn't, I figure it'll be just a few weeks or months before someone comes along and makes an unbroken one.<br/><br/>Thanks, though- Suggestions, when in my power, are always welcome.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>
