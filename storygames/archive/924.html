                    OK. Schlock Fantasy world. Could be <b>Magestrike! ULTIMUS</b>, Forgotten Realms, Burning Wheel, etc.  I'm curious as to new ideas for where monsters come from, like in 1-4 sentences.<br/><br/>Example: Here's where monsters come from in Final Fantasy X (the CRPG):<br/><br/>Humans have this essence, which must be Sent to (heaven analogue) by a priest via this "Sending Ritual". When people (perhaps animals, too, not sure) die without a proper Sending, their essence floats around the world like blobs of living-but-unconscious energy. As it floats away, that energy becomes darker and darker (angrier/hateful/etc). Eventually, they coallesce (sp?) into living forms, and those forms are Monsters. That also explains why Monsters attack living things at random.<br/><br/>Another one, at random (more "rational"):<br/><br/>In this fantasy world, monsters aren't "out there", rather they clearly have roots in animals and people (stuff like displacer beasts, gnolls, owlbears, etc).  In this world, magic has a radiative effect that can cause bizarre evolutionary spikes in small communities of animals (or primitive people). Monsters are the results of that effect.  Way-out-there monsters like Xorn or Gelatinous Cubes were originally regular animals that got hit with the magic effect, evolved, got hit again, evolved, and got hit again; Xorn were originally chipmunks. Gelatinous Cubes were originally bears.<br/><br/>Another one:<br/><br/>Monsters are just like animals. Monsters always have been, and always will be. There is no explanation for them.<br/><br/>Another one ("mythic"):<br/><br/>In this fantasy world, the Gods often walk the earth.  One of the Gods, the God of Dark Creation or whatever, frequently travels the world and mindlessly creates bizarre living creatures without thinking of the consequences. Result? Monsters.<br/><br/>Care to come up with a couple? Looking for creative ones, "rational" ones, bizarre ones, etc.                </div>

                            Monsters are created when people do bad things.  When the King of Crete spurned Neptune, Neptune sent a beautiful bull which seduced the Queen, and their disgusting mating produced the monster known as the Minotaur.  Most monsters in greek myth are the products of "sin" -- "sin" being defined as stepping outside the gender and religious mores of the time.                        </div>

                            Evil acts corrupt the flesh of the wicked--the more evil acts they perform, the more grotesquely they change the body.  When the corruption goes too far, the wicked person goes mad since their mind can no longer process the difference between their new form and the human form it understands.<br/><br/>The nature of the corruption depends upon the evil performed, so that types of monsters instinctively recognize each other, often making them less likely to kill each other.  These monsters can breed, producing frightening yet sterile 'pure' monstrosities.                        </div>

                            Nature abhors a vacuum. When we desire something, she makes it so. When we fear something, she threatens us with it.<br/>

But at the same time, she does not create things whole-cloth; if I say 'In darkness it is waiting,' then I will not find a spectre there, but perhaps a spider, made hungry and mighty by my terror.                        </div>

They're my hungry little children.  They suffer for me.<br/>

They suffer when they are born, because it is painful to be born from nothingness into the world.  The world is, after all, pain.<br/>
They suffer as they live, hungry, always hungry, never able to satiate the ravening emptiness I have given them.<br/>
They suffer as they die, pierced by lances, riven by swords, burned by fire, riddled with bullets, dissected and analyzed by mindless dolts who don't understand half of my genius.<br/>

They suffer because they love me, their father, so I don't have to suffer, suffer from regrets, or grief, or loneliness.                        </div>

Or, a third possibility, that I've always liked:<br/><br/>They're just as much monsters as human beings are.  Consider how many groups of humans have worked hard to wipe out other cultures, races, social groups, etc.  Consider the way medieval writers depicted the Mongols and Saracens -- a whole lot like the way Orcs are represented in most fantasy literature, when you get down to it.<br/><br/>They don't necessarily have to be right or peace-loving -- instead of being better than humans, they can be just as bad.<br/><br/>--Travis                        </div>

                            Every creature posseses unto itself an essence that is shaped by its pyschic states throughout its life. That is, intense emotions and thought patterns etch into this essence, which surrounds the souls of creatures. When that creature dies, the soul attempts to leave this dimension and moves to the next; however, the large amounts of energy weigh it down and anchor it to this world. If it can't reach the gravity of this dimension, it returns, shedding some of its energy and joins a newborn creature. This cycle continues until it can escape this dimension and move on to the next and accomplishes this by shedding the heaviest of these energies which are classified as Sin Energies, or sinergy.<br/><br/>When, in an attempt to find a more 'humane' method of executing criminals, scientists discover this release of energy on the death of creatures with their execution method, it soon is developed as a technology not fully understood. Energy is ever abundant and the world enters a golden age, but one that is corrupt in the center, as the very electricity the world thrives on is suffused with sin.<br/><br/>When these souls, unready for the next dimension, arrive in their new home, Others recognize that the cycle has been warped and erect a barrier between dimensions, making it harder for these souls and all souls to enter the next dimension.<br/><br/>First order Monsters:<br/>Human souls virtually destroyed by these sin sucking machines return to this dimension, and either enter newborns or seek out their energy in the world's electric matrix. Also, souls that were ready to move on but unable to do so return, confused and upset. Thus:<br/><br/>Ghouls:Corrupted newborns exhibit signs of congenital defects that science is unable to cure; symptoms include red eyes, necrotic flesh, and the inability to process cooked meats.<br/>Ghosts (in the Machine): Ghosts begin to haunt their old homes and lives, seeking to understand their situation, or destroy that which they can never have again. Some ghosts discover the scent of their sinergy, and seek it out the energy.<br/><br/>Second order Monsters:<br/>Refinements in the technology allow scientists to take out a person's sinergy without killing them, either by leaving that last little bit or by forcing the soul to remain in the body.<br/>Zombies: Homeless people, kindapped individuals, and anyone that won't go noticed are taken to energy plants owned by evil dictators. Once sucked of their energies, they are tasked with the jobs that no one wants and seem to be complacent to it all; their souls were anchored to the body but are empty.<br/>Vampires: Special projects create individuals with that last little bit, and it forces the soul to starve for more energy. These vampires are fed either by their regeneration beds (coffins) or find their own energy by attacking others and leeching their energy.<br/>Empaths: Rare is the occasion that the electric field in certain core reactors goes a little wonky and separates the soul from its sinergy for but a moment. These individuals find that as they reprocess the energy of their lives they are given special insight into others and can read their sinergy with direct contact or, if powerful enough, at a distance.<br/><br/>Third order Monsters:<br/>The next dimension, upset at the problem with the cycle and unable to resolve it on their end decide to come back to their previous lives and affect some change. There are two mindsets on how to accomplish this.<br/>Lycanthropes: Violent overthrow and destruction of the technology will be necessary to force humanity to stop corrupting the cycle. This will probably cause humanity to fall to a stone age if completed, but it will be neccessary to get things right again. Enlightened souls from the next dimension feel compressed by taking over just one being and absorb another for whatever characteristics it deems necessary. It shifts between these forms as necessary to acquire the abilities it needs.<br/>Changelings: Violence will only meet with more souls being sent too soon and worsen the issue. Change from within will be necessary. Englightened souls from the next dimension feel compressed by taking over just one being and use their ability to manipulate sinergy to change forms as necessary.                        </div>

                            Creation is running down. The world has too many different kinds of creature in it, and more and more often, it gets mixed up about what should be a man, and what should be a beast, and what should be a mountain, and what should be a month. Maybe if we exterminate enough of the other things in the world, get back to the basics, we can keep entropy from winning altogether.                        </div>

                            Monsters wake when you can't put your fear to sleep. That would be all said, but the bad thing is these monsters always go gainst those close to you. The first step in fighting monsters is realizing you cannot kill them. The more you try, the bloodier it gets, but they just. won't. fall. down. You have to learn how to put them back to sleep, and that is to stand by your friends and loved ones, to give them the strength to do it.                        </div>

                            To the fool, the monster seems to come from beyond the pale, a beast in the wild.<br/><br/>Listen:  Faphniros the dragon was once a man; now he is a monster.  It was his greed that made him thus.<br/><br/>Once a woman, her hatred of the lover who scorned her gave Medeusa her ophid-locks.<br/><br/>The scuttling myrmidions once were men, proud hoplites:  it was their blind obedience to an evil king that twisted their limbs and turned bronze armor to chitinous shell.<br/><br/>Here is the lore the wise know:  the principle of the monstrous stems not from xenos (other); it comes from idios (self).                        </div>

                            What I'm using for my (never to be played) Medieval D&amp;D Game: the fairies are descendants of the neutral angels, who sided neither with God nor Lucifer during the great rebellion.  These angels went to Earth, and inhabited places of beauty and desolation.  Over the innumerable centuries, they lost most of their power, but none of their beauty.  While some fairies are good-hearted, they are forbidden from entering the houses of God.  Other fairies have friends among the devils, but are more mischievous than cruel.  Presumably the jinn are the Near Eastern equivalents, and managed to stay on good enough terms with the Big Guy that Muhammad was sent for their salvation as well as man's.<br/>
<br/>
The trolls are all that's left of a primordial race of giants--you see these giants mentioned in the Bible from time to time.  They're related to the fomorians, who had were among the first beings to colonize Ireland, until they were replaced by various kinds of fairies.                        </div>

                            Monsters, like all things, are born of love. When the first man and woman looked into each others' eyes and forgot everything, they abandoned their stewardship of this world. In an instant, the monsters got a small handhold on creation. Now, every time we love, we forget a little more, and the monsters grow stronger. Most say the bargain was worth it.                        </div>

                            Andy: thank you for the Gelatinous Bears reference. Here's my input on the matter:<br/>
<br/>
A: Monsters are schizophrenic hallucinations. Stop killing the townsfolk.<br/>
<br/>
B: Monsters are projections of immensely powerful beings from another dimension - but only projections. They're not the whole creature; each monster of a particular type is just a shadow of a single immense extradimensional being. This explains why all monsters of one type have the same goddamn culture. <br/>
<br/>
C: Orcs, dragons, humans, chimerae, ogres, all these things are monsters. Beholders are not. All monsters evolved from Beholders, very quickly, and they are all monsters because they lost their eyes... and thus they must die.<br/>
<br/>
D: Monsters are schizophrenic hallucinations given life and form by the magic of the world, which bends to the force of insanity. Kill the townsfolk before they destroy you with their firey breath.                        </div>
