The most important upcoming date, though, is <b>May 8, 2010</b>. This is the very last day that products will be accepted. This means that, if you're submitting an electronic product, you need to submit it no later than May 8. If you are mailing products, the postmark must be no later than May 8 or you will just be wasting your money.<br/><br/><b>Publishers:</b> If you've been putting it off, now's the time to start <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/publishers/how_to_enter.asp" rel="nofollow">packaging/submitting</a>!<br/><br/><b>Fans:</b> I ask that you go to the <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?page_id=5" rel="nofollow">Submissions page</a> on the ENnies Blog and see if your favorite publisher has submitted their material. If they haven't, contact however you have to and let them know they need to get a move on!<br/><br/>And while I have your attention, we still need volunteers at the ENnies booth. <a href="http://www.ennie-awards.com/blog/?p=423" rel="nofollow">Click here for more details</a>. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Tony Law<br/>ENnies Assistant Business Manager                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
