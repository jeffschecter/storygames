Mostly that's the sort of thing you could do yourself, of course, so it probably appeals just to my fans (yeah, I have some here in Finland; crazy). The second thing is that it adds crunch: there's roughly thrice as many cool Abilities, Secrets and Keys for each entry as there are in the original TSoY. It's made to my own sensibilities, of course, but I'm sure most anybody will find something to his tastes in there. The third thing is that it expands the setting with new ideas. The table of contents hints at what those are.<br/><br/><b>Who wrote the book:</b> I compiled and edited everything that went into the book, but most of Clinton's original prose is there. The Southern Initiative relies heavily on my forum discussions with Josh Culbertson from last year, you can read those at the Forge. I wrote the parts of the Southern Initiative that I didn't lift directly from those threads. The giants and dwarves originate similarly. Other stuff is mostly from my pen, such as the furry material, etc. As there are many sources of inspiration in the book, each chapter itemizes its sources separately.<br/><br/>And yes, the trade-off of more vs. less material has very much been on my mind. I suppose the book will be funny for others to read in the way it bursts into sermons about how to use setting source material now and then. My own stance at this point of writing (read: after getting it done) is that it takes a bit of willpower, but I can pretend to complete ignorance of anything if I want to, and act like I didn't have that setting material. Also, there's the fact that unlike <i>Exalted</i>, TSoY does not do plot: all that setting material is only "setting" in that it gives a name for something that might or might not be pertinent to an individual campaign. It doesn't tie that material down to the map and say that this must be the thing player characters encounter when they go to those coordinates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221621/#Comment_221621" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T08:55:07+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  8:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I've read most of this new edition, and it's fantastic.

I've been calling the rule set <i>Solar System</i> lately (and using "TSoY" for when you specifically play in Near), so I understood that differently.<br/><br/><b>What does TSoY give to the Solar System:</b> The most basic part is that it's full of immediately usable crunch integrated with the fluff. Most places you can't get both at the same time. Another reason is that while Solar System is universal, it's not generic, and TSoY has been planned to take advantage of the things SS is good at: sympathetic, human stories. In SS I write that the game works best with a setting that is dramatic (people make choices), epic (great changes are possible) and adventurous (the aforementioned are resolved in the grand action adventure tradition); Near as a setting and TSoY as a genre are all of these.<br/><br/>But basically, if the question is whether you need the book to enjoy Solar System to the fullest, I would say not. Only if you're looking for new inspiration, or are already in love with Clinton's haughty, agonized elves, sorry drunk goblinkin or the wicked Seven Houses of Ammeni is this book going to be worthwhile. (Or if you're just interested in the "metaplot" of what I changed and added, I guess.) If you're already up to your ears in setting stuff and don't find making your own crunch hard, this isn't going to be that important.<br/><br/><b>What does WoN give to TSoY:</b> If you already have Clinton's book, then you'll only want this one if you want updated crunch, new crunch or the stuff that is new to this book in comparison to Clinton's. I find that his book is still a perfectly serviceable introduction to the game, especially as it comes with the rules included.<br/><br/>Somebody help me out here, surely there are better reasons for getting this book? I'm supposed to be selling it at Gencon. Perhaps there is a flaw in my carefully orchestrated "split system from setting and sell in separate books" plan that I didn't perceive when I went to it last year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221663/#Comment_221663" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T11:37:15+00:00" title="July 30, 2009 11:37AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2009 11:38AM by DannyK.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the races of Near fit the "everybody's people" approach of TSOY/Solar System really well.  And the goblins are just plain cool, they're even invaded other games!  It's also the setting with playable ratmen that isn't Warhammer! <br/><br/>Can you tell us what's in the setting book that isn't already in the TSOY book?  It sounds like dwarves and giants, but I want more details!  Is the frozen south described in any detail?  Is there more stuff about the nations that are already described?  <br/><br/>Also, is any more light shed on the backstory of the setting?  I've always gotten the sense that there was some kind of big secret behind the setting, the history of Zu, the disaster, the elves, Far, the moon, etc. that tied everything together, but I couldn't figure it out despite multiple readings.  This has prevented me from liking Near as much as I would otherwise.<br/><br/>EDIT: One more question, is there a PDF version?

"Try again later."<br/><br/><b>PDF version:</b> Yes, sometime after Gencon.<br/><b>Completely new things compared to Clinton's book:</b> The Southern Initiative is entirely new material, as are those couple of races, as is the last movement pretty much entirely. All other chapters have new material, most of which is in the crunch. Most of it's been featured in the Internet in some form or other, but some is completely new, and all has been rewritten to work together.<br/><br/><b>Backstory:</b> I'm afraid the backstory is both more clear and less clear than before. It's more clear in that there is more information out of which you can build your mythology and cosmology, but it's also less clear in that it contradicts itself even more now, and still doesn't give an unified explanation for anything. This is one thing I actually like about TSoY, that it does not pretend to a canon. I have nothing against writing about my own understanding of what the "big story" is about, but I didn't feel comfortable doing it in this book, because it'd have been interpreted as "The Big Story" that all gamers, like sheep, are forced to follow by instinct.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221699/#Comment_221699" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T13:10:08+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  1:10PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also:<br/><br/><b>IPR:</b> Yes, after Gencon.

The books themselves are in the USA, but I'll be bringing a bunch with me back after Gencon, and should be able to start mailing them out to customers on the week after Gencon. The price is at 25 \u20ac now, postage included. I might have to adjust that up or down once I have the book and see about the mailing options, but it should be close enough for now.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, I also sent the necessary information about the product to IPR.

So, what makes Near great?<br/><br/>I really like the humanism. I didn't include my anti-fascist fantasy lecture in the book (I almost did, but relented), but basically the bit that I most like about Near is that it very much refutes the concept of heroism as an identity: you are not a hero because you are a son of a god, or because you're the right race or have the right upbringing: you're always and merely a hero because of your actions - heroism is not a state of being, it's a state of action. Contrast and compare with modern, post-Tolkien fantasy literature: it's very easy to get me to scream my hatred at yet another story where the protagonist realizes through a series of conflicts how very special he really is. Near is all about the opposite, about how even the most lowly slave or woman, one that would never be considered as a protagonist of a proper chivalric romance, can still matter and be a force for difference in the world.<br/><br/>(It's ironic that I actually <i>added</i> prongs to the material to support the traditional heroic narrative; makes for more excitement when a player genuinely has a leg to stand on when he claims divine inspiration for his character. Doesn't help him a bit against the bitter widow knifing him in the back, of course, but that's the story taken to the extreme: the game doesn't just refute the idea of divine heroism, it actually allows you to bring in the divine heroes and beat the stuffing out of them. Raising the stakes, that.)<br/><br/>Another thing I like about Near is how organic it is - was with Clinton and became even more so after he let the wolves rip at it a bit. TSoY genuinely does not have a genre, it just is. There is no bibliography in the book, and almost every chapter implies a different literary context in which it would make sense. The book is brimming with genre elements, but they do not form a context we would have to follow in play. I find this extremely liberating when compared to some games that live from and for genre convention. Here I don't have to work backwards from genre models: I can really just look at what the setting is in my mind and play according to that, whatever the consequences might be. (This isn't unique in comparison to many traditional rpgs, understand; it's just rare in well-designed Forgista games, which often draw heavily from genre expectations.)<br/><br/>A third thing I like about Near is that it really, truly has no canon anybody would care about. I've grown pretty good at ignoring canon, but in truth I don't feel comfortable doing that with something like Middle Earth, to pick an example setting; the canon is just such a large part of the value proposal with those settings - the very reason I play in that setting is that I want to figure out how my new story fits in with the canon. I don't know yet what we're doing with Near, but whatever it is, it just might be a new thing in imagination, a thing for our Internet generation. We are postmodern, we do not <i>need</i> a one truth, we can sail in between possibilities and flexibly nail the facts for concrete play while keeping an open mind in the abstract. At the very least, Near is genuinely a setting, merely - it doesn't support, cannot support metaplot when it just barely supports a geography.<br/><br/>A fourth thing I like about Near is that as a dedicated Solar System setting it really is remarkably advanced mechanically. This isn't objectively better than being light-weight, it's just different; when I want to play with material that has really been thought out by many people, material where I don't need to improvise, Near is an obvious choice. The more integrated systems in the game are so complex that they'd be nigh-impossible to improvise; the individual explosive ideas hidden in the crunch landscape so succulent that one stumbles upon such only with luck, and gathering them together in one place becomes a great chore. Having such a rich landscape to work from is a great value add to the game.<br/><br/>The above reasons are almost exhaustive, but I think that they're not quite everything... I suppose that I also simply like the individual ideas in the setting. Or perhaps the simple, birds-eye view they're presented from. TSoY does not try to be atmospheric, it doesn't try to lure you in with immersive prose. It just gives you the tired saints responsible for atrocity, the hungry and short-sighted nobility, inhuman politicians, witch-women turned crazy from grief - and everybody else in the setting for that matter - and asks you to do what you will with the cast. I'm not saying that the quality of the mere ideas is not high - it is, I like them all - but it's not just ideas, but representation. My book has a huge amount of text, but it only names something like half a dozen characters by name, and half of those are dead. It's stark and solely concerned with your autonomy as a player, it refuses to get mired in dictating your stories or their style for you.<br/><br/>Hmm... I suppose I'll need to make that a bit punchier for Gencon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_223328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/223328/#Comment_223328" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-07T16:25:16+00:00" title="August  7, 2009  4:25PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Eero, that was an excellent response.

If you're going to buy, be careful - there's two versions of the product up there at the same price, but only one of them comes with the SS booklet. Has to do with the limitations of the IPR warehouse tracking system, I understand. (Of course if you already have the SS rules, the other product entry might make sense due to smaller postage rates or something - I don't know.)<br/><br/>I also sold some copies of the book at Gencon. Anybody wants to tell me what they think, feel free - I'm usually not that much into attention, but this time around I'm curious of what people think of all the various things in the book. I think it's a very challenging work, in a good way - usually fantasy games try to make you comfortable, but this one pushes the game's methodology to such a degree that I'm not myself completely certain of how some things in there should work together; what I am completely certain of is that there are very few groups in the world that can thrown down with everything in the book without being careful - it certainly has teeth here and there. Also, have to remember that I don't own the setting, so I'm curious about what others with strong vision for Near think of my approach towards the material.<br/><br/>(Also, anybody who bought the book but didn't get Solar System - let me know and we'll fix it. It's possible that the boothies could have forgotten to give you the SS PDF or booklet when I wasn't looking.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_225523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/225523/#Comment_225523" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-18T16:02:22+00:00" title="August 18, 2009  4:02PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to tell you what I think of it, but I have to wait for it, and Starblazer Adventures, to get to me. <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226774/#Comment_226774" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T12:00:49+00:00" title="August 22, 2009 12:00PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2009 12:21PM by Ludanto.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so far WoN is awesome, but I haven't really had time to fully experience it.<br/><br/>I do have a question, though.

The equipment rating replaces the whole check result, including the dice and the Ability. However, your original check result (which is replaced) is the one that is used to determine whether your equipment breaks. The way I've explained this (and I don't know if this helps any, really) is that using equipment allows you to default to a low success, essentially pushing the piece of equipment in between you and the conflict, while your own result is just used in a simple separate conflict to see if you mishandle the equipment. In other words, using equipment just requires you to be good enough to not break it, not good enough to win the conflict itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_226791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto" title="Ludanto"><img alt="Ludanto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i75.photobucket.com/albums/i284/ludanto/EWinkSG.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludanto">Ludanto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226791/#Comment_226791" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T13:17:02+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  1:17PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2009 1:29PM by Ludanto.">edited August 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, that's what I thought, but I was uncomfortable because of the way that +1 ranks work.  Like, in most situations (+1 situations), the only time you'd use the rating is when you'd rolled a Failure(0) to begin with (because otherwise you'd already have a +1), in which case, the equipment would automatically lose a rating.  To put it another way, you would be mishandling the equipment more often than not.  I can live with that, I guess.  I'm just wondering if I'm misunderstanding something.<br/><br/>Thanks and Thanks again!<br/><br/>[EDIT: Or do you (usually) declare that you're using the equipment rating <i>before</i> you roll?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_226816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/226816/#Comment_226816" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-22T15:50:38+00:00" title="August 22, 2009  3:50PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm pretty certain that it needs to be that you declare the equipment after the roll. The ratings are a bit too low to make them appealing before the check.<br/><br/>You're right that using a +1 rating always means that your equipment is going to get damaged. I don't mind; it's just wear and tear, and it can be ameliorated with suitable Secrets or repairs. They can also be activated for other purposes by the various equipment mastery Secrets... overall my solution here has been to weaken the default use of equipment ratings enough to make room for the normal crunch negotiation process. The old system made the default use of equipment ratings so overpoweringly strong that we couldn't fix the situation with Secrets that added more stuff. Here it's easy to give your character some Secret that allows him to do something useful with those +1 ratings if you think that the default is too situational.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
