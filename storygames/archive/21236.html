They routinely suffer from pitfalls deriving from information being needlessly "gated" behind a knowledge check.<br/><br/>1. Player characters that are supposed to be knowledgeable fail routine knowledge checks.<br/>2. Player characters that are not supposed to be knowledgeable succeed on esoteric knowledge checks.<br/>3. Player characters fail critical knowledge checks for a scenario, grinding the game to a halt.<br/>4. Knowledge checks are so overused that "bookworm" characters are marginalized.<br/>5. Knowledge checks that result in "bad information" are ludicrous, far worse than "you don't know anything." (Why is the character who specializes in being a loremaster and thus mostly likely to make knowledge tests also the most likely to give out bad information? Argh!)<br/><br/>Frustrating, to say the least. Problems that can be mitigated with judicious GMing, of course, but I'd much rather a system work with me than against me.<br/><br/>Moreover, I come across the issue of players requesting to make knowledge checks. "Can I roll History to learn about X?" This phrasing is rather poor because it muddies what the character is trying to accomplish. The question is more accurately phrased:<br/><br/>"X is something that I find interesting / important / potentially beneficial, and I would like to use my character's History skill to redirect the focus of the game onto X?"<br/><br/>Or something along those lines. I'm struggling to reconcile this narrative request with the more traditional elements of gaming. Players who have invested resources into making their characters knowledgeable should be provided with some sort of mechanical incentive for doing so, otherwise you run into issues with "dump stats" (if you're playing D&amp;D).<br/><br/>The closest thing I've seen to making this functional is Fate Core with the Lore skill and discovering/creating an Aspect. Unfortunately, Fate has a number of flaws with the system that make it less enjoyable for my players and myself than D&amp;D, and I positively loathe Aspect-fishing in this regard.<br/><br/>Mouseguard (and Torchbearer and Burning Wheel) all have elements of making knowledge useful via Wises, but that doesn't exactly translate well to D&amp;D. (I'd be fine with a player taking Orc-wise and taking a +2 bonus vs. orcs, but that doesn't resolve my issues with knowledge skills like History, Arcana, Religion, etc.).<br/><br/>I'd be interested in hearing how people handle this conundrum.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater" title="Jeff_B_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_B_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_B_Slater">Jeff_B_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465280/#Comment_465280" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-02T19:51:59+00:00" title="August  2, 2017  7:51PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2017 7:58PM by Jeff_B_Slater.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D is a simulationist game that doesn't simulate. It's basically a personalized war game with a couple bad social rules; when the few social rules and most other non-combat rules do interject, they typically do so poorly (in terms of simulation). D&amp;D does a couple of things really well and a lot of things not so well or not at all. It works by limiting certain things and elevating and focusing on others. I don't know how you fix it (i.e. make it what you want). I would say you are better off finding a game that better suits your aims or making your own. You could redue all the mechanics but why, it's like trying to put a circle into a square hole. That's my take at least.

For our group* , if it makes sense that the character should know no roll is needed, you handle the information and that's it. The act of the player remembering and arguing that she's got a related skill, background, bond, class, species, etc is enough to trigger the GM response.<br/><br/>Rolls are only called when remembering the information is difficult. Like, the character is about to be mauled to death or doing something else while trying to remember this crucial fact, or has to remember before a certain amount of time. If this element of challenge isn't present, the only other excuse is that the knowledge is incredibly rare even for the character, in which case fail means different things for a knowledgeable and a non-knowledgeable character. <br/><br/>If a knowledgeable character fails the roll it means that she doesn't know but knows who does -a perfect excuse for a miniquest. If a non-knowledgeable character fails the roll then it's reasonable that she spouts the wrong information and the rest of the characters may roll against whatever the result was to see if they believe it (well, our group is okay with this rule even when it means they all believe the wrong thing, but that's just our group)<br/><br/>3.5 is a bit more explicit about <a href="http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/knowledge.htm" rel="nofollow">knowledge rolls</a> Check where it suggests a different DC for different types of questions. <a href="http://dnd4.wikia.com/wiki/Monster_knowledge_checks" rel="nofollow">4e is even a bit more explicit about what you could get when you beat different DCs</a>.

When player asks if their character knows something:<br/><br/>1. Does pretty much everyone know it? If yes, the character also knows it, or if the game system supports it and there are consequences to failing, ask for a ludicrously easy dice roll. (Ludicrously easy dice roll might DC 0 in most D&amp;D contexts which use ability modifiers or DC around 5 in Eero-D&amp;D.)<br/><br/>2. If pretty much anyone could know it, but it is by no means obvious anyone happens to, then consider: how likely would it be for a median person to know the answer to the question? Then set a difficulty for the check which makes that probability work out roughly correctly.<br/>So if around half of median citizens should know it, the D&amp;D DC would be 10 (11 to be exact, but 5 % here or there), Eero-D&amp;D DC would be 20, or you would call for a D20 roll below the attribute value. In Burning wheel, you would ask for an obstacle 1 wise test.<br/>Or, if you want only 1/5 of median people to know the answer, then the D&amp;D DC would be around 17 (or 27 for Eero-D&amp;D) and the Burning wheel wise obstacle would be 1 or 2, but the next criteria might be more meaningful. <br/><br/>3. If so few common people would know the answer that it is not a meaningful metric, then use a different calibration point; how many professionals would succeed, or how many experts would succeed, etc.<br/>So, if you want a professional to succeed with probability 1/4, the D&amp;D 3 difficulty would be DC 20 (professional has a +5 bonus) and the Burning wheel obstacle might be 3 for a wise or academic skill.<br/><br/>4. Alternatively, you can first figure out what kind of people would have a 1/2 chance of success, check what would be their skill level, and reverse-engineer the difficulty from that.<br/>If you want a master to have 1/2 chance of success, then in D&amp;D 3 the difficulty might be a bit more than 20 (expert rolls at +10, but remember take 10). In Burning wheel, a master would have exponent 7 skill, so the obstacle would be 4.<br/><br/>This all is just the typical way in which you handle skill check difficulty in traditional games, right? It requires some familiarity with the probabilities of the dice rolling scheme and a feel for what kind of ability and skill values are normal, expert or master level, but after that, it should mostly just work.<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>I often augment with the following: first tell what everyone knows, then tell more or let them ask questions if they roll well enough for their character to know the extra information. Sometimes I answer a number of questions based on their margin of success, for example.<br/><br/>Sometimes, if the players ask about something I have not decided yet, and which is not very relevant in the close future, I tell this is the case and let the players tell the answer. Maybe ask for a skill check which tells how much of what they just told is true. Not all players enjoy this, however, as it forces some to change perspective from playing their character to authoring the world.<br/><br/>....\n<blockquote><br/>1. Player characters that are supposed to be knowledgeable fail routine knowledge checks.<br/>2. Player characters that are not supposed to be knowledgeable succeed on esoteric knowledge checks.<br/>3. Player characters fail critical knowledge checks for a scenario, grinding the game to a halt.<br/>4. Knowledge checks are so overused that "bookworm" characters are marginalized.<br/>5. Knowledge checks that result in "bad information" are ludicrous, far worse than "you don't know anything." (Why is the character who specializes in being a loremaster and thus mostly likely to make knowledge tests also the most likely to give out bad information? Argh!)<br/></blockquote>\n1. should not be a problem, since you select the difficulty according to median person, and the knwoledgeable are better than that. If they still fail too often, then they don't know as much as they thought they did, the dice rolling mechanics are a poor fit for your understanding of expertise, or you are setting the probabilities wrong. I would be very interested in traditional roleplaying rules systems where this fails significantly. Maybe D&amp;D 5 with the quite limited variability in proficiency bonus?<br/><br/>2. On esoteric checks, calibrate the difficulty according to the success probability of experts. This should lead to a reasonable outcome, and if not, see above.<br/><br/>3. Not a problem in a sandbox setting. If you are not running that, then don't use the simulationary rules when all outcomes are not acceptable for your goals.<br/><br/>4. I don't quite understand this. If knowledge checks are used often, then presumably characters with high values in them will know more, and at least get the prestige for their character to be the one who justified the GM telling you the result.<br/><br/>5. Only give wrong information when a check fails by a large margin, if even then. Or give random information when check fails by a large margin. Or don't tell the difficulty, tell what the character knows, and let the player know the outcome of their check, so they can use it to estimate how confident they are in the knowledge they receive.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/emarsk" title="emarsk"><img alt="emarsk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/831/nTAGTUPOK6CW5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/emarsk">emarsk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465297/#Comment_465297" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-03T11:10:57+00:00" title="August  3, 2017 11:10AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>1.

If a character is really not supposed to know, then don't roll: they just don't know.<br/>3. If a piece of knowledge is crucial to move the story forward, then don't roll: maybe make the characters work for it, but eventually find a way to handle the info to them.<br/>4. Don't overuse knowledge checks.<br/>5. Give wrong information only if it makes sense: most often if I don't know something, I don't know it wrong: I don't know it at all. Or maybe I can guess, but then I know that I'm not sure. It's very difficult to be positively sure to know something, but it's wrong.<br/><br/>An example: we find a strange ancient artefact, do I know when and where it was crafted?<br/>If I'm not an archaeologist/historian/scholar, then I have no clue at all: no roll.<br/>If I'm a "generic" archaeologist/etc., then I may attempt an educated guess: roll and possibly get it right, or wrong, or have an idea where to find more info. In any case, I know that it's just a guess.<br/>If I'm an archaeologist/etc. specialised in that period/culture and that's my bread and butter, then I know exactly where it comes from: no roll.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/emarsk" title="emarsk"><img alt="emarsk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/831/nTAGTUPOK6CW5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/emarsk">emarsk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465298/#Comment_465298" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-03T11:37:07+00:00" title="August  3, 2017 11:37AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I see it, the main problem with "knowledge" as a skill, is that it's usually so broad and ill-defined.<br/><br/>Let's say that I have an immense knowledge in "science": what does that mean?

The answer here being "cold iron" or what have you.<br/><br/>PLAYER: "Are the fey vulnerable to anything?"<br/>GM: "Everything has a weakness. What do you think they're vulnerable to?"<br/>PLAYER: "I think they're vulnerable to cold iron."<br/><br/>Then test your knowledge skill to see if this is true. Maybe they're vulnerable to cold iron, maybe these fey are different, and they're actually resistant to cold iron. But this rams headfirst into a potential issue: what if the fey really are vulnerable to cold iron in the GM's prep?<br/><br/>The options put forth:<br/><br/>1. Change the prep. (Undesirable.)<br/>2. Tell the player he doesn't know for certain. (Undesirable.)<br/>3. Feed the player false information. (Loathsome.)<br/>4. Establish consequences for failure. (Difficult.)<br/><br/>In the majority of cases, a failed knowledge check lacks consequences that don't feel forced. ("Quantum Ogres," my eye.) I am considering knowledge to be a matter of the ability to research knowledge on a certain subject. Simply being trained in a particular area of knowledge reveals basic information on a subject; researching allows deeper knowledge.\n<blockquote>I think that most of the time, in play, knowledge is better handled from a fictional point of view, not as a mechanical element.</blockquote>\nYes.<br/><br/>To edit in a bit of what Eero said below:\n<blockquote>It should be noted that the D&amp;D conception of knowledge is very cinematic. The purpose of knowledge checks is to either be dreadfully ignorant of some important trivia, or get to expose it smartly and benefit by the knowledge. A highly random check works for these purposes well, because we're not asking whether your character is competent in theology in general; we're asking whether they happen to be able to recognize this obscure scriptural quote at the drop of the hat.

Works for us. Because I try to be very proactive as a GM with interesting and useful trivia, it's fun to play characters who know a lot of stuff; the more you know, the more tools you have for resolving difficulties when something inevitably goes wrong.<br/><br/>It should be noted that the D&amp;D conception of knowledge is <i>very</i> cinematic. The purpose of knowledge checks is to either be dreadfully ignorant of some important trivia, or get to expose it smartly and benefit by the knowledge. A highly random check works for these purposes well, because we're not asking whether your character is competent in theology in general; we're asking whether they happen to be able to recognize this obscure scriptural quote at the drop of the hat. Maybe they can (being an expert in the field certainly does improve your odds), or maybe the nigh-illiterate moron happens to get it simply because it's from their favourite book in the Bible. The checks signify as much relationship between "skill" and "success" as hitting in combat does: sometimes you hit, sometimes you miss, and that happens to everybody.<br/><br/>This cinematic conception of knowledge as an ability to dredge up relevant trivia is a bad fit for certain types of knowledge-encompassing challenges. There are various traditional schemes for making these things work, such as defaulting to averages and rolling longer series of checks to reduce the randomness. Depends on the precise game and its framework what one would do, precisely.<br/><br/>One simple observation: there are only two common creative motives I know of for not telling the <i>players</i> everything interesting. Unless a given game is supposed to be <i>challenging</i> or <i>immersive</i>, there is never a reason to "gate" information. Of course a game may still wish to determine whether a character is ironically ignorant (that is, the players know something the characters don't), and knowledge checks can come in that way, but it's a pretty different thing when it's not the players who are kept ignorant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465310">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465310/#Comment_465310" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T05:22:15+00:00" title="August  4, 2017  5:22AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>One could almost have knowledge checks be for a character to declare something he believes is true, and the check itself determines if it is true.<br/><br/>e.g., "I want to know if the fey are vulnerable to anything," is more of a statement that, "I want the fey to be vulnerable to something so that I can use it against them." The answer here being "cold iron" or what have you.<br/><br/>PLAYER: "Are the fey vulnerable to anything?"<br/>GM: "Everything has a weakness. What do you think they're vulnerable to?"<br/>PLAYER: "I think they're vulnerable to cold iron."<br/><br/>Then test your knowledge skill to see if this is true.

On a successful knowledge check, GM tells how things are if they are established, and if not, asks the player or establishes something by whichever way they usually do.<br/><br/>There is, of course, a problem in letting players author things, if solving problems with fictional means is an element of play. Some player will author "fey are vulnerable to breathing oxygen" or "fey are vulnerable to being close to humans" or "fey are vulnerable to the presence of the colour green" etc. This turns the game into one of solving problems by inventing facts, rather than using what is established.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465319">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465319/#Comment_465319" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T14:22:05+00:00" title="August  4, 2017  2:22PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Always feared this one a bit too, but actually never seen it happen in a game (and we do use this mechanic to some extent even intrad games), not in a way that it would make easy for the GM -and even the rest of the group-to say "no, that makes no sense, try another way".

Many people do not enjoy such a balancing act.<br/><br/>Two similar situations:<br/><br/>1. You like playing intense blood operas and drama games where characters have conflicting priorities and purposes, they clash, there is lots of emotion and probably violence, and then someone gets what they wanted and others usually do not.<br/>You join a group that plays, say, Dungeon world or modern D&amp;D or something, where their characters make up an adventuring party. They may have personal differences, there is some dialogue to this purpose and occasionally a rash action by someone, but it all is subservient to experiencing the adventure as a group.<br/><br/>2. You really like optimising characters mechanically. You join a group where you can optimise your character to some extent, but no abuses, munchkining or serious powergaming.<br/><br/>Some people find out where the norms are and play according to them. Some don't use the option at all - no powergaming or intercharacter clashes or authoring in-fiction. Some use and abuse it to the extent possible within the social context, making a game out of this. Some break the norm entirely.<br/><br/>I think it is generally a good idea to avoid such situations. I'm sure there are exceptions, but they should be intentional.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465325">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465325/#Comment_465325" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T18:41:13+00:00" title="August  4, 2017  6:41PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd say that there are ways to make the tool less of a balancing act and even into a reliable one, but they require specific definitions of the social contract that no design up to date actually knows how to deal with.<br/><br/>From the examples you compare mountain-witching to, all there exudes all-out competition; while the mountain-witching trick itself requires a quite toned down inter-player and GM-player competition at worst and more collaboration at best. This stage can be reached only when both the GM and the players go out of their comfort zone and actually have a good time creating stuff together by building over each other input. <br/><br/>By accepting other's input you make them feel validated, while full blocking others only ruins the fun, so after a while players get the idea and start respecting each other's input a  bit more, thus turning the tool into a fully reliable one.<br/><br/>But then again, it's a different form of fun, it requires someone taking the first step, enough trust to go with it and for everyone to go out of their comfort zone. Our group was able to give this step easier because we had enough bad experiences with competition-stance play that it made sense for us to try it. So if you really know enough your group and they certainly have tons of fun with competition or other forms of fun, then by all means, it is a tool and a situation to avoid. Otherwise, it's as good as anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465331/#Comment_465331" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-04T23:23:45+00:00" title="August  4, 2017 11:23PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 4, 2017 11:27PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Thanuir's first post: read the fiction first and roll or not as it dictates, and there's no trouble.  The trouble comes from using the knowledge check as a button the players can push (or the GM can require them to push).  Using <i>any</i> mechanic in this fashion is risky if the group is hoping to play more fiction-first (e.g. the OSR style I know you like, VSKatana).<br/><br/>As for letting the players invent the truth a successful roll reveals, that's stepping firmly outside that OSR idiom.  If your players like exploring an imagined world that feels real and tangible to them, don't do this.  If a concrete and persistent world is <i>not</i> a priority, then sure, rope in everyone's imagination!<br/><br/>If the goal is to give players bang for their buck, define the scope of knowledge skills before the game begins.  The GM should be up front about what sorts of knowledge skills, if any, they're prepared to support.  Some GMs don't have much room between "everyone knows this for free" and "no one knows this" -- knowledge skills are useless in their games.  Other GMs don't run adventures where knowledge really matters; checks can answer questions, but usually without conferring any advantage.  Then there are lots of different types of GM orientations -- a GM running an epic metaplot may reward lore-style checks, while a GM running a puzzle dungeon may reward engineering-style, practical knowledge checks.<br/><br/>If I were designing to support knowledge checks, I'd designate a few spheres of knowledge, then instruct the GM to pick which of those will be in play before character creation, then let players choose among those, then compel the GM to make them matter in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465334/#Comment_465334" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-05T06:01:34+00:00" title="August  5, 2017  6:01AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Warriormonk,<br/><br/>I agree with your previous post.

But it also makes me yawn a bit - it's limited, it's arguably not the best tool for the job in this case.<br/><br/>The discussion here is all about "does the character know X?", and the tool is a binary random roll. I'm not sure that's the right approach. As a designer, I'd want to be think less about that, and more about the kind of conversation I want the players to have at the table.

(e.g. what is the next step in solving this?)<br/>* "Does the character's knowledge of X come from a reliable source, or a biased one?"<br/>* "How difficult might the character's known facts be to verify?"<br/><br/>Etc.<br/><br/>At least, that's what I'd be doing if I were designing some "Knowledge check" rules for a game. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>(Somewhat notably, this approach can be used regardless of whether your interest in "Knowledge checks" includes player authorship of world details or not; they can work either way.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465346">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465346/#Comment_465346" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-06T01:23:35+00:00" title="August  6, 2017  1:23AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanuir,<br/><br/>When I run sandbox games, I certainly couldn't spell out which knowledge skills will come up when, or shoehorn in picks that I didn't wholeheartedly embrace from the get-go.

In those games, when players would like to know something about the greater world or its history, I'm usually going to come down on the side of, "There's no way you would have known that."  The main source of lore is entertainers -- traveling bards, basically.  So if you're wondering if you recognize the name of some band of adventurers who completed a colorful quest a year or two ago, my answer is usually, "Did you pay a lot of attention to bards?  If so, then yes," without asking for a roll.  In my mind this isn't a matter of character skill or applied study, it's more a matter of circumstance and recall.  If I'm gonna gate those behind a roll, it's gonna be a pretty arbitrary matter of luck -- usually I'll just give it for free.<br/><br/>If a player were to hit me with, "My character has spent tons of time attending to all the stories of all the bards and even quizzing them about the facts afterward," then sure, I'd let them buy a "knowledge - recent regional adventures" skill or some such.  But I've never had anyone do that.<br/><br/>Engineering skills, similarly, are outside the realm of most of my characters' potential experience, so evaluating what it'd take to bring down this structure or prevent this cave-in is usually up to player assessment and creativity, not character expertise.  This is part of the fun in such problem-solving scenarios in my games, as a challenge to the players as much as to the characters.<br/><br/>One thing characters in my games do tend to need background for is dealing with nobles.  It's plausible either way -- maybe they have, maybe they haven't, maybe they've learned some etiquette, maybe not.  So before anyone makes characters, I mention that etiquette knowledge will make a difference at some point, and if it fits with anyone's character concept, it'd help the party.<br/><br/>Since I deny characters any starting knowledge of actual ritual magic, some players like to load up on related fields like herbalism and religion, which are the world's mundane interface with the supernatural.  I clarify exactly what this is good for -- talking a good game to other peasants, acting like you know your stuff in a language they understand.  It doesn't let you dispel curses or heal wounds, though.  This is something that gets rolled a lot in social situations.<br/><br/>So the fictional premise provides a lot of the logic and constraints, but I'm sure another GM would translate a lot of it differently than I do.<br/><br/>In general, I would say that my dungeon crawls are higher on social encounters and lower on skill checks than most.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465358/#Comment_465358" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-06T15:47:14+00:00" title="August  6, 2017  3:47PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Our historical D&amp;D campaign has pretty similar circumstances, in general.<br/><br/>An observation about specialty knowledges, though: in our D&amp;D campaign the pattern tends to be that while some players stick to playing the same character all the time, there's a demographic segment of players who enjoy playing various sorts of odd specialists. This then leads to a need to figure out what such specialists would know. For example, the following are all characters that we've seen this year:<br/><br/>- A master stonemason<br/>- A foreign doctor<br/>- A herbalist nun<br/>- A member of a witcher-like pagan Norwegian monster-hunting cult<br/>- An urban journeyman smith<br/><br/>As we essentially need to figure out what these characters would know anyway, it makes sense to have concrete rules for it, on the principle that we want to mechanize the things that matter (so as to make them firmer, more gameable and generally acknowledged as real).<br/><br/>Another observation is that even if we ignore all sorts of unique snowflake characters with weird social backgrounds, the great unwashed peasant masses of 1350s V\xe4stermanland still seem to have a few rifts in life experience that could go either way, and require me to ask the player of the most average Fighter imaginable what their character's background is like. The most important:<br/><br/>- Is the character from a zealous family, an average family or a crypto-pagan family? Matters a lot when it comes to literacy, theological skills, recognizing the runes, etc.<br/>- Is the character's family mainline Swedish, or are they from an ethnic minority? (Lappish, Finnish, etc.) Matters for magical alignments, mythological lores and such.<br/>- Does the character's family engage in serious hunting, or are they strictly farmer-herders? Matters a lot when determining baseline wilderness skills and area knowledge.<br/><br/>Again, I like having a knowledge rules system of some sort to gauge this stuff. Of course I could just query the players as necessary and make binary decisions, but putting some numbers to this stuff makes it more tangible, particularly when characters wish to improve themselves, as D&amp;D characters often do. It's a little character development option that players can engage with, and much preferable to having them agonize over some stupid combat maneuver choices instead.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465359/#Comment_465359" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-06T19:11:08+00:00" title="August  6, 2017  7:11PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2017 7:22PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Random note: I hate Survival or Wilderness Survival skills for medieval characters.  If you want to make Con checks or something to see how roughing it works out for you, fine, but don't roll to see if you <i>can figure out how</i> to hunt, forage, build fires, tell basic directions, etc.  Just because the players might not know this doesn't mean the characters didn't all have it down pat by the time they were 14.

If no one at the table already has a vision about who can build fires, then maybe a bad roll early on establishes that in this world, it's a non-trivial skill!

Very much worth taking, and writing a background to justify, if you want it!  Extensive area knowledge varies too, although my PCs tend to leave their home front pretty quickly, so this isn't really a choice motivator.  Hunting default for non-hunters is, I think, an interesting statement about the gameworld culture, as is fighting ability for non-soldiers.

Here are some common issues that pop up regularly:<br/>- Is your character fit enough to travel according to this travel plan?<br/>- Will you get lost by choosing this route?<br/>- Have you ever been to this area before?<br/>- Do you have the knowledge to pack appropriately for this journey?<br/>- Do you know how to fish effectively enough to make it worthwhile?<br/>- Can you ski in the winter (yes, this was a huge strategic issue last winter in the campaign)<br/><br/>I cannot in good conscience take these sorts of skills as a given even for generically rural adventurers, as the 14th century setting features a developed distinction between heartland agroeconomy and mixed frontier economies; characters from the former sort of background (which would be pretty much anybody from a larger farm in the region around the lake M\xe4laren) would not necessarily have so much experience with these skills that they would be a routine for them, while a character from a frontier household would presumably have grown up in a house where the manfolk, specifically, spend a quarter of the year in hunting in the wilderness, making for a solid background in wilderness skills. The distinction in backgrounds is quite palpable, and as far as I know there were homebodies in 14th century Sweden just like there are today. Think hobbits vs. rangers in Lord of the Rings, if you will [grin].<br/><br/>So yeah, we find plenty for skills in this area to address. Playing various sorts of trappers, hunters, herders, forest rangers and hermits is popular in part because such a background makes the character useful in delivering the payload (that is, the less robust adventurers) intact from point A to point B on the wilderness map. Of course a more stream-lined D&amp;D would simply say that woodsmanning is a separate character class - the Ranger - and everybody else are however mediocre at it. (Interesting similarity with the history of the Thief, there: the moment you introduce the Thief, it becomes quite questionable whether other characters are at all capable of sneaking and climbing...)<br/><br/>But anyway, that's just the particular approach I'm taking in this campaign. It's relevant for the thread mainly in that we use plenty of knowledge checks that seamlessly blend into all other sorts of skill checks.

It's not the most interesting, nor the most fruitful procedure. It tends towards "you know everything" or "you know nothing", neither of which are always particularly useful for roleplaying, nor ideally suited to create player choice. <br/><br/>(Also, unless I am mistaken, this thread is not purely about OSR-style "challenge the player" games, which means that broadening the discussion might be useful as well.)<br/><br/>My proposal was to deal with more nuanced applications of "Knowledge" checks:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>This approach reduces the role of player skill, but makes knowledge skills more reliably useful (or at least impactful). </p></div></blockquote>\nThat's a pretty interesting reaction. It seems to me that leaving "do you know everything or nothing?" to a single random die roll is the ultimate in "reducing the role of player skill".<br/><br/>I'd be much more interested in an approach where Knowledge skills give you something to work with... but it's your ability to turn that to your advantage (as a player) which is being tested.<br/><br/>For instance, some D&amp;D-type games might have a challenge which looks like this:<br/><br/>* There is a magical curse affecting a certain area, which the players wish to enter.<br/><br/>Rolling once to see whether the characters know how to dispel the curse seems like the least possibly interesting way to handle the situation.<br/><br/>Learning that the curse was created by a certain type of creature/sorcerer, cast in a particular "magical language", subject to the phases of the moon, described in incomplete form by the scholars of such-and-such a place, addressed in a book carried by the scribe, but by people unfamiliar with its entire effects, or likely partially negated by holy magic (but only by someone pure of heart) is much more interesting.<br/><br/>Some people use Knowledge checks this way already (intuitively, or from experience), but I think encoding it into a ruleset might be really fruitful.<br/><br/>For instance, imagine coming face-to-face with a dangerous enchantment or sorcery. <br/><br/>* If you have the appropriate Knowledge, the GM will tell you the name of the sorcery and something about its nature.<br/><br/>* Now, roll your skill/ability (or perform some other procedure), and the possible outcomes are things like:<br/><br/>Great roll - You know what steps could be taken to dispel this sorcery or transform it.<br/><br/>Excellent roll - You know where the information on how to dispel or transform this sorcery are to be found, and reliably.<br/><br/>Typical roll - You know that it can be dispelled, but to do so, you must expose yourself to it.<br/><br/>Or perhaps - You have information on the sorcery, but you doubt the veracity of the source or its completeness.<br/><br/>On a poor roll - You have a vague sense of what it might be, and you know how to learn more details about what it is, but to do so, you must give it the means to act, which means spreading outward from its current location.<br/><br/>On a terrible roll - You are aware of a few costly ways to protect someone from it, but not how reliable they are.<br/><br/>That's a (sloppy) example of how you might build in a subsystem for dealing with "Knowledge" skills in a way which presents interesting chances to the players instead of simply throwing all the information in their lap. <br/><br/>Aesthetically, in an OSR context, such information might be represented in Random Tables, with Knowledge checks giving access to different tables, perhaps (if you wanted to present it in a "familiar guise" to that particular tradition of game design/play culture).

This is how it works:<br/><b>1)</b> Have a situation in play, and an interesting setting (or lacking that, interesting imagination).<br/><b>2)</b> Allow the players to ask questions and seek answers via various maneuvers, such as consulting allies, remembering useful information themselves, seeking in libraries or whatever finds their fancy.<br/><b>3)</b> Establish success by whatever means. Often some dice rolls are involved. Get a sense for the depth and completeness of the knowledge gained.<br/><b>4)</b> Answer the questions with <i>interesting</i> knowledge. More success gives you more facts or less well-known facts, but it's all interesting and pertinent to the question.<br/><b>5)</b> Allow the players to apply this knowledge in <i>useful</i> ways.<br/><br/>The distinction between steps 4 and 5 in there is crucial: the GM does not provide useful information, he merely develops and improvises an interesting setting. "Interesting" means thematically compelling and tactically actionable. Greater effort at information gathering gets you more of the "interesting" information, which may either improve your chances of figuring out something useful, or it may simply confuse the issue with multiple red herrings, depending on the situation.<br/><br/>I find that enacting this teleological detachment makes research, exploration and knowledge aspects of D&amp;D actually interesting, because that whole realm of play is now relegated into a sort of GM story hour that the players can tap at will, for idle entertainment or lethal curiousity, as occasion warrants. The GM does not distinguish between important or non-important information, because the information has not been construed as such in advance: only the way the players may decide to apply the information in play determines its value.<br/><br/>This does, of course, mean that I technically speaking do not know if a given problem has an useful solution or not. For example, one of the adventurers in our campaign got afflicted with what they thought was vampirism last fall; I did not have a solution or a cure in mind, and when research was engaged in, I responded strictly with diegetic beliefs and folklore that the characters in the setting might know; I showcased the setting, letting the players piece together what they considered a sensible course of action. Because the illness in question never was actual vampirism, I never had reason to determine whether their cure would have been efficacious, but if that knowledge were needed, I would have determined it only after the fact, rather than having a ready-made solution in mind in advance.<br/><br/>It's one of those weird brain disjunctions that I find useful to practice in D&amp;D refereeing; helps maintain overall hygiene of the play process if the GM leaves plan-making and puzzle-piecing to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465378/#Comment_465378" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-08T19:16:41+00:00" title="August  8, 2017  7:16PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero,<br/><br/>I agree with that.

For instance, perhaps in your game knowledge of aesthetic matters (e.g. art) functions differently than experience in warfare, and still quite differently from occult expertise!<br/><br/>Like the OP, I'd like to see more of that in conscious game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465380">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465380/#Comment_465380" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-08T19:30:40+00:00" title="August  8, 2017  7:30PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I like to see is rethinking this sort of thing from the ground up, independent of the adventure game paradigm. Adventure game stuff tends to come back to D&amp;D sooner or later anyway, while other kinds of games actually should not try to use those structures created for adventure gaming.<br/><br/>That's one thing I like about how open-ended drama games like TSoY and Apocalypse World handle knowledge checks: they basically couple the knowledge issue into dramatic action by asking what a character <i>does</i> to gain knowledge or use knowledge. Knowledge essentially becomes a choreographical element of expression ("this is how my character solves problems, by knowing stuff"), a plot point ("we need to do this exciting thing to learn an important fact") or a pacing device for drama ("we cannot resolve the story yet, because we lack the knowledge to do so").<br/><br/>But that's just one approach to handling the idea of character knowledge. "Knowledge check" by itself is such a narrow thing. It should be handled carefully or not at all when you move away from the adventure game context in which it was born.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465381/#Comment_465381" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-08T19:34:22+00:00" title="August  8, 2017  7:34PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_465396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" title="Thanuir"><img alt="Thanuir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thanuir">Thanuir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465396/#Comment_465396" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T10:53:15+00:00" title="August  9, 2017 10:53AM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/> </p><blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>This approach reduces the role of player skill, but makes knowledge skills more reliably useful (or at least impactful). </p></div></blockquote>\nThat's a pretty interesting reaction.

This in contrast to the methodology where a successful check gives you information with no guarantees it would be useful, and then it is up to you to figure out what to do (which might mean ignoring the information you just got).<br/><br/>Your list is a good idea about things to keep in mind, when someone uses knowledge skills.\n<blockquote><br/>For instance, some D&amp;D-type games might have a challenge which looks like this:<br/><br/>* There is a magical curse affecting a certain area, which the players wish to enter.<br/><br/>Rolling once to see whether the characters know how to dispel the curse seems like the least possibly interesting way to handle the situation.<br/></blockquote></div></blockquote>\nAs a referee, I treat the question "Do I know how to dispel this curse?" as a broader question "What do I know about dispelling this curse?". Unless it is a very famous curse, or you have investigated it a fair deal, the answer is almost certainly "Nothing." to the first question, and general discussion about dispelling curses to the second question, with the amount and specificity of the answer depending on character background and outcome of the roll.<br/><br/>As a Burning wheel game master, on the other hand, "I want to test sorcery/curse-wise to know how to break this curse." would be a legitimate test. (Outright dispelling it with a sorcery test might also be suitable stakes.)<br/><br/>I think the "What do I know?" -approach leaves more room for player skill, while the second is better at making sure the action moves somewhere and the knowledge skills are relevant.<br/>\n<blockquote><br/>That's a (sloppy) example of how you might build in a subsystem for dealing with "Knowledge" skills in a way which presents interesting chances to the players instead of simply throwing all the information in their lap. <br/><br/>Aesthetically, in an OSR context, such information might be represented in Random Tables, with Knowledge checks giving access to different tables, perhaps (if you wanted to present it in a "familiar guise" to that particular tradition of game design/play culture).

The precise way of dispelling a particular curse might be level 6 info, given that each curse is different and so on. Level 5 info would be a review of general facts concerning this curse, or knowledge about how to dispel some other related curse (by the same witch, say). With 4, you know a lot about curses or dispelling in general. With zero, you know that curses are not nice and witches cause them.<br/><br/>Player can choose to reach for more information, but there is a price. The group (or GM, or whoever) chooses one problem for each level you are overreaching. The knowledge might be unreliable, you don't know but you do know who knows or where you can find it, you can probably find it out if you have d20 months to do the research, etc. Or make it a random table; but, generally, circumstances are likely to set some constraints.<br/><br/>I'd go with fairly deterministic results if I were using this kind of classification. Your level 6 knowledge of removing the vile worm curse also implies level 5 knowledge of removing other curses, level 4 knowledge about curses in general, level 3 knowledge about magic in general and level 2 knowledge about pretty much anything relevant to your culture. So, just define the top level knowledge your character has and you are good to go.<br/><br/>Example knowledge skills: student of magic (4), vagrant (1), archmage of destruction with a focus on effects of fireballs on local fauna (6), child (0).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465400/#Comment_465400" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-09T13:14:21+00:00" title="August  9, 2017  1:14PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Thanuir" rel="nofollow">Thanuir</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Player can choose to reach for more information, but there is a price.

With the proper focus on the events this could be used to actually avoid the combat roll altogether. Like, it would made sense if it was a coup de grace, right? <br/><br/>I also found a way of making traps in a simple fashion that helped me avoid spotting and disarming traps rolls on some instances, just by asking the players how did they approached the place and what they do. Like, if in your prep the trap trigger is a stone slab that sinks when a medium-sized character steps on it, and then it releases an arrow at head-level from the end of the corridor, you can have players navigate through it just by asking them precise questions: who's going first? do you do anything while walking in this corridor? I still have players roll when there's a chance they notice something or for their reflex saves, but now I spill out the information when they properly probe and navigate the dungeon.<br/><br/>So this could be applied to lots of things in the dungeon; however, you need to be precise about specific things in the nature of each thing. For example, you would need to have a generic logic around spells too, like they all have a source of power, some way to determine the effect like "instructions" a link to keep things together and maybe some sort of protection for some of those parts for more advanced spells and defects for some of those parts when magic is poorly used. Spellcaster players would know this is the norm and based on this they could try and test their player knowledge to probe, test and hopefully disarm the spell like if it was a bomb.<br/><br/>So basically, the players could try and get information or do anything without rolls, but only as long as the GM and the players know the basics of how things actually work, instead of just their effect, and then only if the right questions and approach is used.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_465442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/465442/#Comment_465442" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-08-10T12:47:09+00:00" title="August 10, 2017 12:47PM">August 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: GM Story Hour, I love providing that as a thing that players can tap at will, but I've encountered a lot of compulsive tapping and player confusion about when it's going to be merely interesting vs immediately useful.

Point <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> doesn't strike me as too odd, I'm a smart cookie on lots of subjects and I'm constantly faced with gaps in my knowledge. d20+small modifier is enormously swingy, is that the issue?  (Rolling 3d in Burning Wheel is never going to hit Ob 5 unless you dump a bunch of Artha.)<br/><br/>I don't design scenarios with "must pass" knowledge checks. The "must pass" knowledge check is a bit like the "must win" fight. The approach I much prefer is when players propose that they might know something (maybe even something specific) as a way of trying to get leverage. Confront the players with a problem that you don't know how they're going to solve, and they can suggest they might know the bishop, or that they understand how sewers under the cathedral were recently maintained, or how the church gets its laundry done.<br/><br/>I suppose the difference between a fight and a knowledge check is the latter is a single, atomic action. You can win a fight but come out badly beaten up; there's not really much equivalent with knowledge checks. GUMSHOE makes each knowledge area a resource; you spend points to be smart about architecture in a way that will plausibly help you.<br/><br/>A similar approach is to externalize players' 'knowledge resources'. The bookworms have books which have lore points. (This works in fantasy settings, less well when you're an modern, well-educated expert.)<br/><br/>I think it's useful to have a palette of 'near miss' options. You have a vague idea, but you're aware there are gaps in your knowledge. You learned Thabian's Rule for this situation, but it always struck you as a little bit simplistic. You don't know, but you know who does. You know (or you knew) but your knowledge is out of date - something has moved, or changed.<br/><br/>One pattern that I'm now a little suspicious of is the knowledge check as a way of filling in exposition. In small quantities it's fine, but the wished-for moment where players have an in-character realization about background information seems unsuited to role-playing. The most extreme form of this is when players are supposed to have a realization about an inconsistency between two separate pieces of exposition. ("Wait, this can't be a real Sveylan temple, the engravings are all wrong!")                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
