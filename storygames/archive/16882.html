I recently got back a book I loaned a friend on Time's "100 Ideas that Changed the World, history's greatest breakthroughs, inventions and theories", and I've been thinking about what if something was never invented or that concept was never thought of.   To be clear I am NOT talking about a simply going back to a time before there was space travel or television or the Internet or whatever, but something more complex, sort of an alternative world where some important concept or technology doesn't exist and anything leading up to it or related to it, also doesn't exist.  <br/><br/>Basically I'm thinking on the lines of the movie "The Invention of Lying" where because no one had ever thought of the concept of lying.  It wasn't just that people were 100% honest with each other; there was also never any stories, no religion, lack of hope/faith, etc.  It was really a bleak world but the writers were so clever to take every single instance of anything that could be based on the concept of lying out of that world to start out.  To a less dramatic degree I've played a few Zombie games where zombie lore doesn't exist in that world, so when things start happening, people have no reference of what is going on.  Obviously like in the movie, during the game we learned what a zombie was.  As a side line, I don't like zombies much, however "Zombie Cinema" is VERY good.  <br/><br/>However, what I am looking for is if anyone has ever tried to remove completely from a game world a core concept or piece of technology.  Maybe it's the modern age and no one has ever thought about what it would be like to fly?  In fact people don't even look up at the sky as there are no birds and no stars at night?  No one has ever tried to build wings, there are no stories of angels, no stories of trying to fly?  I hope this makes sense and I hope this is posted in the right category.

Many of them imagine the future as an extrapolation of the time they were written, but end up missing out on certain major advances that are now common place. For example, Neuromancer managed to envision a completely networked world, but missed out on the advent of ubiquitous wireless networking, and so cyberspace works in a very different way than it actually does in the present-day real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Onix" title="Onix"><img alt="Onix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/814/nLOXPRKOM00IG.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Onix">Onix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384768/#Comment_384768" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-10T17:40:16+00:00" title="July 10, 2012  5:40PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree, old science fiction is a good go too for this, stories like the Chronic Argo and Micromegas are groundbreaking but also naive given current science.<br/><br/>It also makes me think about how the electronic computer was invented because mechanical adding machines were too slow to produce cannon firing tables for all the cannons being built for WWII.

Very good stuff.<br/><br/>(I prefer Shock: Human Contact, though it's not alternate universe-y. It's ultra futuristic.)<br/><br/>And, I'm sorry, but most of the stories about the world being MORE brutal without Christianity that I found when I researched the net were evangelical propaganda. It's most likely Christianity was a pacifist religion before the Roman Empire adopted it, but my personal feeling is that a lot of the principles of the militaristic Cult of Mithras got mixed in along the way. Doesn't stop me from being a Christian, but I seriously doubt a world without Christianity would be any more brutal than the one we got.<br/><br/>The only argument you might reasonably be able to make is that a world without Christianity might never have embraced the idea that slavery is evil. It was small Christian splinter groups that promoted that idea, subsects within the greater whole. But it's also quite possible that a world ruled by Buddhism would have come to the same conclusion. (The eightfold path says that trade engaging in living beings is not a right form of living.)<br/><br/>AAANYWAY, to get off the subject of religion and back to gaming/gaming reference materials: I couldn't find anything good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/slliska" title="slliska"><img alt="slliska" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/631/nGS1XYKEZ7DB8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/slliska">slliska</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384855/#Comment_384855" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-11T16:39:24+00:00" title="July 11, 2012  4:39PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 11, 2012 8:27PM by slliska.">edited July 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will have to check out Shock and Human Contact, they sound interesting.<br/>My only interest in the Sci Fi story I mentioned was as alternative history and that was the only detail I could remember.

I both own and love the card game Chrononauts.  I'm unreasonably fond of time travel, so I tend to pick up any boardgames/card games or RPGs I can afford with a time travel theme or mechanic.  However, that's a great way to kickstart some group ideas.  Thanks, I'll try that some time.  <br/><br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_384920">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hanshan" title="Hanshan"><img alt="Hanshan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/461/nTCLWUFEMBNO2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hanshan">Hanshan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/384920/#Comment_384920" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-12T03:47:02+00:00" title="July 12, 2012  3:47AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not futuristic, but it is one hell of a alternate history sci-fi novel. Philip K. Dick's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_High_Castle" rel="nofollow">The Man in the High Castle</a> posits that there is a world where Totalitarian imperialism wins out the war, explores the nature of their conquest of the continental United States, and then meditates on the authenticity of consciousness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
