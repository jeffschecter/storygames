                    Here's an alternative Snap-based mechanic for <i>The Gay Recruitment Squad Wants YOU!</i> It's meant to be lighter and more fun than the previous rummy-based mechanic.<br/><br/>Does it make sense? Can you see any flaws or ambiguities? Does it sound fun?
<blockquote>Each player gets dealt a card, which is their <i>Skill Card</i>. Each player also has a pack of cards, which they hold face down. The GM doesn't have either a Skill Card or a pack of cards.<br/><br/>Then, starting with the player to the left of the GM and going round, each player throws the top card of their pack, face up, into the centre of the table.<br/><br/>If this card has the same number as your Skill Card, you can claim it, by putting your hand on it. If you claim the card before anyone else does, you win your challenge.<br/><br/>However, the GM will also try to claim the card. If he claims the card first, you lose your challenge.<br/><br/>Also, if another player has the same number on his Skill Card as you, he will try to claim the card. Only one of you may win the challenge: whoever claims the card first wins.<br/><br/>Carry on dealing cards, going round the table, until everyone has won or lost their challenge.<br/><br/><b>Assisting</b><br/><br/>Rather than taking on a challenge yourself, you can choose to assist someone else in their challenge.<br/><br/>If you do this, you don't get a Skill Card, but you are allowed to claim cards on behalf of the person who you are assisting. Of course, they can claim cards too.<br/><br/><b>Chanting</b><br/><br/>If you successfully complete your Regimental Chant before the challenge, you can claim a card on behalf of any other player. Also, they may claim a card on your behalf. <br/><br/>Only one player may attempt a Regimental Chant before the challenge. If a player attempts a Regimental Chant and fails, no-one gets the benefit of chanting; similarly, if two players attempt a Regimental Chant, everyone loses the benefit of chanting.<br/></blockquote>

<p>Do you really need the term 'skill card'? "Your face-up card" works just as well, and doesn't introduce jargon senselessly.</p>

Everyone has a full deck of 52?  If so, where do the skill cards come from?<br/>Or the rest of the deck gets dealt out face down?  Which has the awkward possibility of all of a rank being dealt out.  And begs the question: why deal out the deck?

What happens if I claim a card I don't have a legitimate claim to?  Especially if I'm the GM and it's harder for me to remember all the legitimate ranks?                        </div>

But they're <i>really simple</i>, Nate. I mean, really, you can't criticise that resolution mechanic for being complicated. What do you find complex about it? Is it just the idea that it's a Snap-based mechanic and you'd prefer something less frantic?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            Thanks, Judson, good questions.
<blockquote>Everyone has a full deck of 52?  If so, where do the skill cards come from? Or the rest of the deck gets dealt out face down?  Which has the awkward possibility of all of a rank being dealt out.  And begs the question: why deal out the deck?</blockquote>
The plan is that the Skill Cards (or face-up cards, in the second description) come from a separate deck.<br/><br/>That might change, of course, but I'm trying to avoid the problem you describe: that, say, every player has a Queen as a Skill Card, and so there's no Queens to "snap" with.<br/>
<blockquote>What happens if I claim a card I don't have a legitimate claim to?  Especially if I'm the GM and it's harder for me to remember all the legitimate ranks?</blockquote>
That's a really good question. With the quickfire nature of the game, I think you should lose your challenge if you touch a card you're not entitled to.<br/><br/>If the GM makes that mistake then...well...I'm not sure. You can't have all the players lose their challenges if that happens. But I like the idea that one player should automatically win their challenge if the GM makes a mistake. How to select that player (in such a way that it changes each time), I'm not sure.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            i think it may take away from story tone.  it would jump rapidly to a different pace.   it may have positive effects to, like increasing excitement in a possibly boring game?  i don't know Graham, it's your game dude, if you're dead set on people smacking cards, which is a cool idea, than go for it.  i wouldn't put the mona lisa in the sistine chapel.                        </div>

                            okay, i've read the mechanic again.  yes, i don't like it.  i no longer play "slap jack" for a reason.  it was cool at twelve, but the mechanics should mirror the games presentation and/or it's drive/motive, and/or it should become invisible.   people slapping for cards is gonna get WAY DISTRACTING, i'm not sure if that needs an actual play to prove.<br/>what i'm saying is these mechanics need to be GAYER!  Gay them up!  i'm somewhat joking, but really they should be like spices to enliven the players and bring them into the right tone of the game.                        </div>

                            Hey Graham, <br/><br/>I didn't even look at this thread at first because I'm a idiot about card games - sorry.<br/><br/>Snap is definitely an improvement in terms of matching the tenor of the game - it is much simpler but still retains elements of skill and tactical interest.<br/><br/>If you succeed in the chant, do you designate a player to assist?  If you declare that you are assisting, do you declare similarly?  Or can you help any other player?<br/><br/>The GM is obviously at a slight disadvantage - I think that's fine, but you'll want to make sure the system works reliably if the GM never/always gets the cards.                        </div>
