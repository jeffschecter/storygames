I'm a dirty hippy gamer but I also like tactics and wargames, so I was approaching this as "think of it as just a really complicated boardgame, completely gamist, play it by the book, see how it goes."<br/><br/>Also, we decided that since the default setting is vague to the point of non-existence, we were going to make our game ancient Indian-subcontinent themed.<br/><br/>So my dwarf wizard is named Vajrinathi Pradesh and he was an ascetic yogi who spent ten years meditating in a cave on top of a mountain.<br/>He goes around smeared in ashes, wearing only a loincloth, chastising people for their attatchment to the illusory material world.  In combat, he calls upon the icy winds of the Himalayas and the thunder-claps of Indra to destroy the unenlightened.<br/><br/>Also, he doesn't have a beard.  Gasp!  Shock!  Horror!  He shaved it off as part of forsaking all worldly desires.<br/><br/>The other PCs were a tiefling paladin, and a halfling warlord.  No striker meant that our damage output was limited so some fights dragged on more than normal.  I was impressed with the wizard's crowd-control abilities (killing six kobolds with one freezing breath spell is pretty fun).  As a tactical game, it feels pretty solid.  I like the synergy between abilities of different classes, that encourages you to cooperate and plan your actions. I also like the potential for big dynamic set-piece battles where you use skill checks to interact with the environment and things are changing round-to-round, even though we only got a hint of those possibilities in our first session.  It reminds me of the video-game inspired stuff that got me into RPGs in the first place, way back when.<br/><br/>Aside from killing stuff, we also did a skill challenge wherein we tried to whip a town's lazy and cowardly garrison into an effective defensive force.  Kind of a Rocky training-montage kind of a scene.  This wasn't something the GM had planned ahead of time.  When we got to town I said "Hey I want to try a skill challenge soon" and everyone agreed.  Later, the GM mentioned a guard and one of the players started up a conversation with him, and in response to the interest the GM started developing the guard and the situation more, and we found out that all the first-rate fighters had been drafted for some border war (I forget the details) so the town was left with just the dregs.  The halfling warlord wasn't happy with the low expectations they were setting for themselves, so on thing led to another and then "Hey guys, I think this is our skill challenge".<br/><br/>It feels like they're on to something with the skill challenges.  Not perfect, not super-innovative, but giving some structure to the non-combat scenes and putting the task-resolution skill rolls into a larger context is a step in the right direction.  I feel like with some tweaking and building (as many people on this forum are already talking about doing) the skill challenge could become a robust sub-system for all-purpose non-combat conflict resolution.<br/><br/>(continued...)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152329/#Comment_152329" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T23:12:20+00:00" title="June 22, 2008 11:12PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a weird disconnect between the game mechanics and the "flavor text" aka the fiction.  As many people have already pointed out, abilities like "I hit this guy so hard that you can heal yourself" are pretty abstract.  One thing that's actually real nice about this is that you have a lot of freedom to re-theme things, as we did with our ancient-India re-theming, precisely because the connection is so tenuous.  We got into doing some pretty elaborate narrations for the results of our attacks.  And when the rules did something weird, we would come up with an elaborate post-hoc fictional justification for it.<br/><br/>For example, our paladin was a devotee of the raven queen what's-her-name, the death goddess.  (Maybe we should have made this into Kali or Yama...)  The player explained that the reason he can heal us by hitting enemies is because when we're wounded, invisible raven death spirits begin to crowd around us, waiting to carry our souls away if we die.  When he hits the monster, he's like "Hey raven spirits!  over here!  This guy!"  So they leave us alone (causing us to recover from the brink of death) in order to crowd around the newly wounded.  Hey, that's pretty cool.<br/><br/>(I've noticed that Warhammer 40k players do this fictional-justification-for-weird-rules-result thing a lot, too.  The rules feed into the fiction, but as a wargame, the fiction has no way to feed back into the rules, so it's just something you do to add extra color.  I don't know if it's role-playing or not but it's still fun.)<br/><br/>However, this disconnect can really get in the way of trying to develop a character portrayal, since the game-mechanics part requires you to be a cold-blooded monster-killer who will happily loot corpses for a few silver pieces.  (It's a bit ghoulish if you think about it.  "Check their teeth, see if they've got any gold fillings!")  I guess this problem has been around ever since the very first version of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>In our game, we had this dinner scene.  I used prestidigitation to separate all of the meat molecules in my dinner from the non-meat molecules and drop them in a separate dish, so I could eat the rest without violating my pseudo-Jainist dietary restrictions.  (That I had just made up on the spot.)  I was pretty happy about using at-will wizard powers to establish color and character traits.  But I mentioned this to Ben and he said:<br/><br/>"So, you won't eat meat, but you'll happily kill dozens of sentient beings?"<br/><br/>Me: "Pfffft, they're just kobolds.  Kobolds don't have feelings."<br/><br/>Definitely a disconnect there.  Like nothing in the fight scenes affects the story scenes, and nothing in the story scenes affects the fight scenes.  Much like a Japanese video-game RPG, come to think of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152333/#Comment_152333" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T00:11:17+00:00" title="June 23, 2008 12:11AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jono,<br/><br/>Yeah, D&amp;D's historical issue of the subtext of racewar and sociopathic-murderers-as-heroes thing has bugged me for a long time.  One of the ideas I have for the setting is that the usual "enemy races" are actually materialized negative energy from purification rituals- goblins are evil thoughts, orcs are evil deeds, hobgoblins - evil laws, and kobolds?  Good deeds undone.<br/><br/>Also, when I mentioned the idea for long term play as the PCs as agents for the Queen?  That was part of the idea of flipping over the concept of violent looters and instead into folks with missions and goals.  Something we didn't get to apply for the one shot that I'd love to use a lot in long term play is the Quest mechanics- where you can take on long term goals and get xp for their completion.  To me, that seems like the ideal way to get out of "random guy going into random ruins killing random people for phat loot" that summarizes most of D&amp;D's history.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bifi" title="Bifi"><img alt="Bifi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bifi">Bifi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152350/#Comment_152350" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T01:53:13+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  1:53AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Me likes the Indian stuff!

Then the players play their hero's after that.<br/><br/>Now, the character motives for going in might not be to kill them all, but to sneakily take back the food and wealth, or capture them all for trial, or to even negotiate. But the IMPORTANT thing is, they go into a dungeon to do all that. A place of danger - as long as there's danger involved, what your there for is flexible.<br/><br/>Though it occurs to me that if your going to facilitate protagonisation, then some types of character would just stay at home. I think you'd need to establish before gameplay with players that while that'll be accepted, no play will revolve around characters who stay behind - their story ends there. That way players who'd get in a huff over that could decline to play in the game (assuming they take any responsiblity for their own fun, that is). For those who wouldn't get in a huff, perhaps make multiple characters to lessen the chance of becoming just a spectator. That or they continue to play some of the monsters.<br/><br/>* Err, or not children. Decide on the lines and veils before play. Basically the idea is that the creatures should be hurting things you the player (not just PC) care about.

Reminds me of a game I did where I decided that the reasons that dwarves grew beards was because they considered themselves to be the chosen people, and others could not look on their bare faces.  (Inspired by the North African Tuareg.)  Dwarves outside of the dwarven lands grew beards, but those in the dwarven lands didn't all.  Those, however, would wear veils when people of other races were around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jono" title="Jono"><img alt="Jono" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jono">Jono</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152557/#Comment_152557" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T17:35:45+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  5:35PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh oh oh!!<br/><br/>Kobolds and other low-level grunt monsters are people who were evil in a previous life. They're born into the wretched forms of monsters as punishment for their bad karma.  By killing them, we are releasing their spirits from imprisonment-in-flesh so that they can be reborn again as something better.<br/><br/>...Except that since the kobolds have pretty much been doing nothing but Bad in their kobold-life, they're going to get reborn as something even worse.  If we want to help them, we need to trick them into doing virtuous deeds so they earn good karma...<br/><br/>THEN kill them.<br/><br/>Of course, by going around killing all these kobolds, we become murderers, and therefore earn bad karma for ourselves.<br/><br/>So actually, track karma numerically, and then put PC death on the table.  Make it relatively frequent, in fact.<br/><br/>When your PC dies, make a new one.  Your race is determined by your karma level, which carries over.  You might be a kobold yourself, next time around.<br/><br/>Might have to skip a couple of decades between adventures, Hero's Banner style, to give the newborn PC a chance to grow up to a playable age.<br/><br/>Maybe not all the monsters are reincarnations of evil men.  Some of them are rakshasas.  Rakshasas want to tempt people into doing evil deeds to keep them away from enlightenment.<br/><br/>Once PCs win a fight, they must decide how to treat the defeated monsters.  (Getting all enemy HP down to zero means "you've won the fight". It doesn't mean you've killed anyone, it just means you have them at your mercy.)  The correct way to treat a monster might be very different depending on whether it's a reincarnated human soul in a monster body or whether it's a rakshasa trying to trick you.   So you have a little bit of a puzzle with trying to figure out which type you've just dealt with.<br/><br/>At this point maybe I'm talking about a completely different game from D&amp;D4, but so be it.  Karmic religions have a subtext of "anything bad that happens to you, you deserve it because of your previous-life karma".  I find that a bit squicky.  But squicky in a way I'd like to explore in an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bankuei" title="bankuei"><img alt="bankuei" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bankuei">bankuei</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152559/#Comment_152559" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T17:55:09+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  5:55PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, I was thinking in a fun combination of "What happens if you actually could purify away bad karma?
