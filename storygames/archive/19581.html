I'm trying to understand what's new in Jenna Moran's The Chuubo's Marvelous Wish-Granting Engine RPG. I'm in love with her writing style since when she had a different name and wrote Nobilis 2nd edition. I even bought Nobilis 3rd edition and, despite the art, the book is in my opinion one of the better in its prose. At last an rpg manual that you *want* to read, not one you *have* to read just to grab the rules.<br/>So. I know the author has written another game. I know it's new in many ways. I think I've read somewhere that the character generation is similar to the one in Nobilis 3rd edition.<br/>Apart from that, getting any actual information about Chuubo's etc etc is a hell!<br/>There are threads on rpg.net which are - at least to my eyes - very esoteric (meaning that, if you don't already know what's going on, you're out).<br/>There is just one review on DriveThruRPG.<br/>The author's blog doesn't clarify a lot, either.<br/>EOS press (the publisher) website is broken.<br/>Ok, I can buy the game and read it myself, but... where can I find just a bit of info?<br/>Any help is appreciated. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>Ciao<br/>Lorenzo<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435220">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435220/#Comment_435220" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T08:02:09+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  8:02AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 8:02AM by CarpeGuitarrem.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how they compare to Nobilis, but I know there's a few main features of the game that stood out during my playthrough...<br/><br/>Emotion XP: you can earn XP by getting a specific coded reaction from other players, like facepalming or a thumbs-up. Some of the Emotion XP triggers feel like they'd work better than others, but they all play out of generating an atmosphere of wanting to react to the other players.<br/>Character Arc XP: you earn XP as you advance your character through specific arcs by taking actions listed in the arcs. It's much like Marvel Heroic's Milestones, but fleshed out and made into the meat of gameplay.<br/>Genre XP: you can even earn XP for playing through a mundane scene (like cleaning fish) in a way that resonates with the setting and the mood at the table.<br/>Plug-and-Play Setting: the game supports a wide variety of genres, and introduces different tones and setting assumptions with its included rules. (This is done mainly by changing what you earn genre XP for.)<br/><br/>Note: I haven't actually read the book. I've just glanced through sample rules and played a session. But the meat of the game seems to be earning advancement by engaging the other players and the setting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/summerdown" title="summerdown"><img alt="summerdown" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/summerdown">summerdown</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435223/#Comment_435223" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T12:03:44+00:00" title="July 14, 2014 12:03PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 12:06PM by summerdown.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll second this wish to understand the game. I've actually bought it (in epub), and though I'm only part-way through, I am finding it difficult to understand what it would be like to play. Most of the examples on the internet seem to involve jargon, people who know each other really well, and a scenario that they got from the kickstarter. I've found the results a bit opaque.<br/><br/>My biggest wish is for more variety in use cases. All the play examples I've read are pastoral Ghibli-style soap opera. I'd love to hear an example of how it handles something like Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser or Conan, but that doesn't currently seem to be out there.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/carpeguitarrem">@carpeguitarrem</a>, could you give any details about the scenario you played, and the sort of things you did in it?

However, I know that there are rules that could support it.<br/><br/>It's been a while, so I'm fuzzy on the details--I remember we were on a boat ride to Fortitude, and eventually wound up arriving there and solving smaller problems like a missing cat. Gameplay was heavy on exploring the world and engaging it.<br/><br/>Most of our actions were interacting with the world and with one another. There were some times we fell back on the resolution system (very much like Nobilis, with players bidding effort against one another), but it very rarely happened. Instead, the mechanics typically consisted of interaction with multiple levels of XP-granting actions. (For instance, you have some actions from your character's current arc, some actions from the genres, and some actions from eliciting reactions.)<br/><br/>Resolution is very much a case of "how much effort are you willing to expend?" So that could easily turn into tension and threat if the GM raises the stakes of actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435231/#Comment_435231" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-14T13:03:26+00:00" title="July 14, 2014  1:03PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 14, 2014 1:03PM by snej.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm sort of confused too.

Practically the first thing you do when making a character is to decide on their first arc. The purpose of questing and gaining XP is ultimately to progress along your Arc or maybe change course and start a different Arc. These are long term, each step on an Arc is 3-5 quests, and it may take months of a typical weekly group to accomplish that. <br/><br/>Mundane arcs encode what story your character is enacting. You could be protecting someone or something (Shepherd Arc), achieving greatness (Aspect Arc), or trapped between two worlds (Otherworldly Arc). Likewise, Miraculous arcs encode may of the character types from Nobilis 3rd edition but take them in somewhat different directions. The Ace Arc encodes the Aspect heavy Noble, the Wounded Angel Arc encodes the Fallen Angel Imperator, and the Accursed wield's encodes an Excrucian with the World Breaker's Hand. But these aren't just references they describe the evolution of these archetypes and remake them without the specific backstory of Nobilis. <br/><br/>The core system for resolution is the same skill + Will expenditure that Nobilis 3rd used for mortal actions. I've found it a solid system when I was running Nobilis and is one of my favorite additions to the 3rd edition. I especially like how it separates correctness and looking good from effectiveness (accomplishing your goals) and productivity (improving your life).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cpenguin" title="cpenguin"><img alt="cpenguin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cpenguin">cpenguin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435415/#Comment_435415" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-16T22:13:27+00:00" title="July 16, 2014 10:13PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What I have the hardest time wrapping my head around is what, exactly, the HG should be doing.

There would still be quite a lot of time in the session left. So then you might want to<br/><br/>a) spend the money raising an army.<br/>b) begin a revolution<br/>c) Realise it's gone too far, and help a bunch of nobles escape.<br/><br/>... etc.<br/><br/>I'm not sure it matters what scale you work at, necessarily. Where I'm having difficulty understanding is how CMWGE deals with repeated conflict in a single session. Once your will has gone, how is there any tension in what follows? Yet, repeated conflict seems important for emulating some fantasy genres.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435514/#Comment_435514" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-20T05:48:16+00:00" title="July 20, 2014  5:48AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Intentions are not a conflict resolution*. They are a means to put into the fiction what you want to do, how you want to do it, and how much effort and risk you are willing to incur. Then you get some guaranteed set of impacts on the story, although the HG can always give you more. Its always a movement toward your goals or towards a better life or being impressive. This changes the situation, but it doesn't have to resolve your intention. It might, but that is part of the conversation with the HG. If you are resolving a goal through intentions alone, it is through fictional positioning. <br/><br/>In Chuubo if you are working the intentions system and not the XP / Quests system you are probably going off theme for your character and genre. XP actions carry a stronger weight - letting you fade into the background with the resonance of that action - giving you momentum in the fiction. Also, properly long term goals should really be quests - meaning actual progress will then determined by XP accumulation, rather than a sequence of intentions which describe the immediate effect of your action. Chapters are on a pretty clear XP action clock, and will and intentions reset between them, not at the end of the session. <br/><br/>*This is a really good thing. Conflicts are pretty important to stories, letting them linger, grow, and transform is at least as much fun as resolving them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_436579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jenna_Moran" title="Jenna_Moran"><img alt="Jenna_Moran" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jenna_Moran">Jenna_Moran</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436579/#Comment_436579" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-06T12:37:21+00:00" title="August  6, 2014 12:37PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>i.e. how would it work if you have to:<br/><br/>a) Sneak past some cultists.<br/>b) Climb a wall into a compound.<br/>c) Knock out a guard.<br/>d) Disguise yourself as a priest.<br/>e) Climb a snake statue while worshippers chant below.<br/>f) Prise out a jewel and avoid a poison trap.<br/>g) Find a secret door.<br/>h) Kill the ape guardian of the tunnel.<br/>i) Escape and fence a precious jewel.<br/><br/>... all in one session? <br/></blockquote>\nSo there's a couple of ways to think about this.<br/><br/>From the Adventure Fantasy perspective, the system really only cares about Will for the sake of immersion---it's finite so you think of it as a limited resource, but you're not really supposed to run out. (Unless you take that as gospel, start spending it faster than a person in your PC's position "should" push themselves, and even then you'll usually be OK until one day you go to make coffee and knock over the coffeepot and fall down because you suddenly discovered that you're too spent to be functional.) The danger in this scenario comes when the HG throws something at you that's out of your league to see what happens, or when you declare yourself into danger to get a Trouble action, or when you take a Decisive/Science/Faith/Sorcery Action and overreach. Actually surviving that trouble is handled in an erring-towards-lenient version of the standard retro "do something clever as a player."<br/><br/>If your gaming group wants to err more towards... challenging the players to win or die? Well, remember that you're playing through this in linear time, rather than holistically. You'll <i>know</i> when you think about spending more than 1 Will on sneaking past the cultists that by doing so you're depleting a finite resource. If that concerns you, you've got two very realistic choices: scale up and put 2-4 Will into some Intention like "stick to a detailed plan of action for proceeding, which goes like this," or scale down and put 0-1 Will into very immediate and short-term Intentions like "add this room to the map" or "listen carefully to see if there are cultists in the next section." More generally, the key thing there is that the HG isn't giving you a series of challenges; you're just saying what you do, and the HG says what happens. <br/><br/>If you're on the Road of Trials, that's one way the story could go---trying to be cautious and "win" slows Action XP, which makes your chapters last longer, which makes Will management a concern. You can try all kinds of workarounds ("Intention 6: stick to the plan" "Intention 8: be a total badass ninja adventurer") but either you codify what you're going to be doing, in which case circumstances can change under you; or you let the HG codify what you're actually doing, in which case your willingness to go forward might shift instead. Either way, your Intention only gets you what it gets you, y'know? And fundamentally---like pretty much always in any player-vs-HG, player-vs-player, or player-vs-system roleplay---you'll have to have a plan that mixes some proportion of "actually good" and "sounds good to the HG," and it's <i>that</i> plan you'll be applying the Intention system to.<br/><br/>Pastoral, Gothic, and Immersive'll play like the Road of Trials, but a lot more leniently---the game just plain won't care as much about the challenges, and that'll both affect how the HG runs things and give you a reasonable shot at a chapter refresh between steps. I assume Epic Fantasy would be more about the curse you pick up from unwisely stealing the jewel, Techno would treat the whole thing as a stylized Ritual, and I'm failing to imagine a Fairy Tales game that plays through that scenario. (Though I'm sure it could happen, I just can't see it.)<br/><br/>I think the two key takeaways here are these:<br/><br/>* first,  you're not using Intentions to hit numeric targets and overcome challenges; they just back up your action declarations.<br/>* second, they're not really tactical, but the closest they get to being tactical is "the more Will you spend on an Intention, the more committed you are to this course of action, so make sure you're stating an action that's worth being that committed to!"<br/><br/>The closest thing to an actual skill roll in the system is actually probably an XP Action, weird as that may sound!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_436623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/436623/#Comment_436623" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-07T06:02:07+00:00" title="August  7, 2014  6:02AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 7, 2014 6:33AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I struggle with as HG is knowing what scenes should be about.
