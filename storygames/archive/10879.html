I'm a bigger board gamer than I am a role player, and the two hobbies fill very different niches for me. Role playing games don't tend to be about success or failure to me, but the quality of the story. Unless the game you are playing has clear cut win or lose conditions, or a game with a competitive mechanic (Polaris, DiTV, In a Wicked Age, etc) who cares if people "cheat"? Why even call it cheating at all? If the GM is allowed to fudge rolls, shouldn't the players be allowed to as well?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241313/#Comment_241313" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T14:19:32+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  2:19PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simple answer: yeah, sure, why not, as long as everyone has fun with it.<br/><br/>More involved answer: games with Fortune in them are, on some level, trying to provide complication or constraints on the creativity. As such, "cheating" just robs yourself of the challenge of dealing with a setback or complication or finding a creative solution to a Fortune-provoked constraint.<br/><br/>Special case answer: some games use Fortune to apportion narrative control, which in effect distributes the spotlight (ideally, evenly over a long enough play span or a full sequence of discrete play time units; e.g. episodes in PTA). Cheating in such games, in effect, is saying, "My ideas are better than the theirs." Bad mojo.<br/><br/>(I use Fortune as it's the easiest to cheat--fudge die rolls--but it could easily be replaced with "resource mechanics" or some other handling element which could be cheated.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241324">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241324/#Comment_241324" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T15:08:21+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  3:08PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jacob</cite>Why even call it cheating at all?
