My playstyle has evolved, but it's forever moored to the traditional wargame. As one of the unfortunate few whose first exposure to D&amp;D was the unfortunate 3e, I've internalized a number of a bad habits, many of which I've curbed, many more of which still afflict me to this day. In particular, one annoying habit is calling for a roll without clearly understanding or knowing the consequences at hand.<br/><br/>In the majority of cases, behavior is exhibited with the players going along without a roll until uncertainty or danger arises, in which case the rutted neural pathways activate, and I blurt out, "Roll X," not really considering the roll itself. What are the consequences for failure? Does it make sense for this to have a binary resolution, or should it be a gradient level of success? What is the appropriate difficulty? Have I accurately communicated potential risks and rewards to the players? Is this scenario appropriate for a single roll resolution, or should it require multiple rolls?<br/><br/>(A rather silly set of top-down concerns, overall, as the most important metric is whether we're having fun, and by all rights, the "sprinkle enough rolls throughout the game to keep things interesting" works for the majority of games and players.)<br/><br/>I'm curious for the rest of you: what are those old habits you've developed as a gamer and how do you modify, overcome, or ameliorate the negative effects of them?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466024/#Comment_466024" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-03T00:25:30+00:00" title="September  3, 2017 12:25AM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm a strong believer in the word NO.<br/><br/>As a GM and player I played way too many hours of guaranteed success.

I'm having a hard time designing without it. That's why I summed up <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/422143/#Comment_422143" rel="nofollow">this list of uncertainties</a> so I can look at them and choose another way. However, that's not everything, and it's also the structure of the game that affects why we choose to use dice rolls. We design to lead up to dice rolls, and if we design for that process, it's not just change the dice roll for something else.<br/><br/>\u2022\xa0Thinking of dice rolls as challenges. This fell flat when I designed a game where the heroes succeed with everything. I had to fall back and really think about what kind of challenges there are out there. I found five.<br/><br/>\u2022 Designing with rewards in mind. Dice rolls are a type of rewards, and it's the most addicting one based on the random outcome of positive results. We have XP, artha, and some poodle points in fanmail, and it's hard not trying to design with that in mind. I prefer nowadays to design interactions that are fun in themselves rather then having to rely on rewards, but it's hard. Really hard. I blame D&amp;D for this.<br/><br/>\u2022 Thinking in terms of GM-less and dice-less, when it should be the other way around. It happens because "roleplaying game" is not a genre in itself but a subgenre. This becomes really apparent when some people have to describe their games as of what they don't include: dice, game master, acting in character, etc.<br/><br/>\u2022 Having characters with a certain type of stats. I had trouble breaking away from using attributes or skills, because - again - roleplaying games has a clear process that leads up to using stats (with dice roll).<br/><br/>\u2022\xa0How roleplaying games are written need to go through a reform. For example, starting with character generation isn't a smart thing to do because the reader doesn't know what a roleplaying game is and how the character is used. I'm stuck on this point for now.<br/><br/>\u2022 Writing roleplaying games as a game engine instead of a game. Typical roleplaying games are "Put whatever you want together to make whatever you want", but what's really the game part is the adventure + rule system. Before I realized that, I wrote games like D&amp;D.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466043/#Comment_466043" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-03T14:56:14+00:00" title="September  3, 2017  2:56PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2017 3:06PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" rel="nofollow">Mongrel_GM</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm a strong believer in the word NO.</p></div></blockquote>\nI absolutely agree that I want a significant challenge and that I don't want guaranteed success. But to call this "NO" is a misstep. To me, the worst thing that could happen to a session is that a GM gets an idea in their head about what the right solution is to something\u2014because they've already created the story before hand\u2014and the players try to solve the solution but the GM just keeps on saying: "No, that doesn't work,"..."No, that doesn't work,"..."No, that doesn't work,"...etc. This is one of the many reasons I  just dislike preplanned sessions, and prefer play-to-find-out what happens RPGs. The GM supposes that the group just isn't thinking creatively enough or putting in the right effort to solve the problem and let's the players continue to bumble and bumble with nothing interesting happening. Instead of just making an adjustment for the sake of the game, the GM holds tightly to their preconceived plot and their expectations that the players should be able to solve the problem, and the game goes nowhere and the players get frustrated (and for good reason). This happens way too often. <br/><br/>P.S. I agree that in a traditional type RPG (i.e. when you are strongly advocating for a character) I want death or something of extreme significance to be an option. There have to be stakes. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466045/#Comment_466045" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-03T15:31:45+00:00" title="September  3, 2017  3:31PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">@Jeff_Slater</a> You describe an extreme GM stance of "guess what I'm thinking" which I've experienced first hand.

I also don't like the unwillingness to change and improvise and take things in another direction that the players are going. If the players are solving a solution in a reasonable way, the solution should get solved.  The game isn't about simulating the real world  where there are 12 ways to solve a problem, but the GM has chosen the one way that the players must solve it,  and that's that;  it's about having a compelling game with a compelling interaction between the players and the world.  It's not how things work in real life, it's how things work in a movie. Sam Harris explains it like this:<br/><br/>"The sweet spot for fiction is something that has enough verisimilitude to be credible and yet it's a heightened reality which makes it much more interesting then just finding out what happened to an ordinary person on an ordinary day."<br/><br/>If you lose the heightened reality and the interest what's the point? More than a single hint should typically be unnecessary if the GM has started the premise accurately and isn't in love with their creation. After all, the GM has one mind and one perspective and the amount of times that that one mind and perspective should trump five different minds and five different perspectives is fairly rare. So I would say offer a hint\u2014and maybe repeat this process once but no more\u2014and make sure you stated the premise of the problem correctly and that all relative information has been restated, but if  there's no progress in the story at this point then be willing to kill your darlings and adjust, because in all probability it's not your players it is you that has miscalculated. If the process takes more than two or three minutes, I would say you're doing it wrong. IMO, there's nothing worse than a GM who falls in love with his creations; for example, a GM who advocates for their NPC's instead of seeing them as a tool to create a great story and a great interaction.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466050/#Comment_466050" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-03T19:31:40+00:00" title="September  3, 2017  7:31PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people love renaissance paintings, but some people like romantic era paintings.<br/><br/>It's pretty clear who is wrong and who is right.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" title="Jeff_Slater"><img alt="Jeff_Slater" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater">Jeff_Slater</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466052/#Comment_466052" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-03T21:32:14+00:00" title="September  3, 2017  9:32PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2017 9:33PM by Jeff_Slater.">edited September 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand it's a matter of preference overall.

But I've had some success moving on and recovering from gamer baggage.<br/><br/>Anyway, some things those games have taught me:\n<ul><li>They taught me that survival is the first order of business.</li>\n<li>They taught me that success, at basically any story-based cost, is justifiable.</li>\n<li>It taught me that knowing the rules was the best way to defend myself against a hostile GM.</li>\n<li>Fellow players taught me that one of my objectives is to 'keep up' with the power level of the party.  If I build a sub-optimal character, I'm playing wrong.</li>\n<li>It taught me that the 'proper' way to GM was about mechanical challenges, rather than figuring out how to just tell a cool story that engages the characters/players.</li>\n<li>Adventure modules taught me that A happens, then B, and then C.  In that order, without deviation.  And if the players don't follow in that order, then they are wrong.</li></ul>\nWhat got me out was a few years of Primetime Adventures 2E, A Penny For My Thoughts, Ribbon Drive, 1001 Nights, and games like this.  Games which simply don't <i>allow </i>you to think about the game in terms of survival, and where success is mechanically governed by the game design, and not by a game master.<br/><br/>Essentially, my advice would be to try to remove those things you're struggling with from the equation, and you'll be forced to engage and learn new habits, and that can help you break out of those old habits.<br/><br/>Also, read <i><a href="https://www.amazon.ca/Play-Unsafe-Graham-Walmsley-ebook/dp/B009IRMQ7G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1504477947&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=Play+Unsafe" rel="nofollow">Play Unsafe</a></i>.

I've also heard gaming advice that NPCs who want to beat the PCs should be played to beat the PCs. No pulling punches. (Usually the fight is stacked against the NPCs in some way, or there needs to be some avenue for PC retreat.) Smart players will figure out that you are playing soft.

It is just playing them realistically, playing them as they would act in your fictional world. This is what a GM is supposed to do; what a GM isn't supposed to do is advocate for thier NPCs and want them to"win," and the players to lose. A GM should stay neutral, and if they do decide to tilt in a direction, it should be towards the players (although I agree, that I would like the GM to stay neutral so that the challenge is real).  So the question that I'm asking is whether you think a GM should advocate for their NPCs, in the way I've defined it?<br/><br/>I don't mind they're being a single answer to the problem if it's genuinely a riddle that can only have one answer, but if you've gone over the problem five times and have given hints, it isn't the players who aren't being smart. There's nothing about a GM that  makes them more inherently intelligent than the players, it's just as likely that the GM has constructed a poor riddle as it is that the players aren't solving the riddle because they're not being smart; in fact, it's more likely, given the number of the players, that the issue is on the GMs side. I'm just speaking from my experience, but in most of the games I've played, it has been the GM who thought they were being super clear, rational, and obvious when their problem was actually framed poorly, and it was less the challenge that was an obstacle for players, than it was just trying to figure out what minor thing the GM thought was relevant and so telling. Anyway, I haven't played a ton of GMed games, but I did play a 5E game every week for about six months every week before we started playing. I have had moments where I was satisfied because a GM set up a really clever puzzle (so I can definitely see your point); however, this never happened from a GM saying: "no, that didn't work." It happened by the GM adjusting and continuing the narrative when something we tried didn't work until we either figured it out via the information coming out of the narrative through a "hint" relative to the story or we didn't figure it out and we had an all "ah ha" moment when the answer revealed itself naturally in the narrative. Obviously, one can't do this in every situation. In other words, his puzzles were clever and interesting and very relevant to the plot in very dynamic ways. I personally think it's very hard to pull off well; the guy who was able to do it regularly had been GMing every week for 15 years. Admittedly, the GM didn't plan much before the session, he just made a couple NPCs  and had some general ideas to work with, so it was much easier for him to adjust, plus he liked adjusting things anyway, as the characters did different things to influence the story. Anyway, like you say, that's pretty much a matter of taste\u2026 <br/><br/>\u2026 I'm way more interested in whether you think advocating for an NPC is something a GM should do. <br/><br/>Maybe someday I'll see the light and agree with all the stuff you say, and won't be a pain, haha <img alt=":smiley:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smiley.png" title=":smiley:"/> <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM" title="Mongrel_GM"><img alt="Mongrel_GM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mongrel_GM">Mongrel_GM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466058/#Comment_466058" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-03T23:11:38+00:00" title="September  3, 2017 11:11PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Ok, playing an NPC according to their desires, there personally, and their intelligence is not the same as advocating for them.

The dreaded GMPC is a cliche' pitfall, maligned for good reason. Advocating is ridiculous when the GM can create whatever killer situation they want to. And the PCs are protagonists, always. Often it is the GM's job to torture and persecute the PCs in order for them to become the epic protagonists of the story. <br/><br/>I think it's okay for the GM to have favorite pet NPCs. Some are just more interesting and fun, and as GM I will spend time in character. I understand and empathize with each NPC on some level. Sometimes I do hope the PCs won't butcher them without good cause. Some of my NPCs are as smart or smarter than the PCs, and those NPCs usually know when to beat a hasty retreat. This might be a GM failing of mine. I'm sure I've frustrated players with this. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Jeff_Slater" rel="nofollow">Jeff_Slater</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I don't mind they're being a single answer to the riddle, but if you've gone over the riddle for or five times and giving hints it isn't the players who aren't being smart.

To what extent do you think that game design (in the context of *when* a dice roll or randomizer or group vote etc.) leans towards that structure the same way that fiction leans towards climax and resolution near the end of a story? So we play, play, play in a particular part of the story, then want to know how that turned out after doing all the "set up."

It does seem that many groups start plunging into character creation in a way that won't allow much of a feedback loop. Where one-shots are concerned, especially story games, that is an important thing to think about. I haven't given it much thought, but it makes sense that I should.

I think there is no problem with them, if you know what you have in your hands (i.e. a toolbox). Ofttimes, when my goal is to create a certain kind of world with certain events, and invite players to play their PCs there, the only other "external" I need is that toolbox that is the action resolution system. Maybe it would be best if all games were built from the ground up, and the designer thinking about how the game should work, along with alternate ways it might be played, too. But if thinking in terms of "shared narration vs. central narration" (i.e. no-GM/GM) is a helpful question for a designer to answer, then it's not a bad question to be asking oneself during the design process.<br/><br/>Some meandering thoughts:<br/><br/>D&amp;D has had decades long influence on the gaming industry. But since it pretty much started tabletop gaming, we could forgive it for all sorts of foibles. Beethoven broke the music world with his symphonies, and made all sorts of trouble for composers for many decades, but who would debate now that the changes weren't awesome? Maybe not a good analogy, but I hope I'm making my point. <br/><br/>In short, dice work for a lot of people. But they don't have to be for you. Stats and simulation rules work for a lot of people. But they don't have to be part of your designs. There are many ways to create challenge, and some people will like this or that type of challenge, it's all a matter of preference. <br/><br/>40 years is a long time or not a long time, depending how you look at it, and the art form is still in flux. That's probably a good thing, but it will present real world challenges for now. Perhaps it will always present challenges and always be in flux. Or maybe the nomenclature will be developed better, leading to clearer ways to discuss a myriad of game design combinations, with fewer assumptions, as "hybrid" games continue to be created.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466095/#Comment_466095" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-05T20:42:15+00:00" title="September  5, 2017  8:42PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been finding that anytime I run a game that <i>kind of</i> differs from D&amp;D, but isn't <i>extremely</i> different, we'll hit a block sooner or later. Like, if I host Archipelago, then okay, it's tricky for everyone to learn this new thing, but it's obviously such a different thing that nobody will try to turn it into D&amp;D.

One solution is to play games where the characters <i>logically</i> do dramatic stuff, either because they're a little nuts (while still basically normal) or because the set-up forces them to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_466108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466108/#Comment_466108" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-06T13:11:49+00:00" title="September  6, 2017  1:11PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>In the majority of cases, behavior is exhibited with the players going along without a roll until uncertainty or danger arises, in which case the rutted neural pathways activate, and I blurt out, "Roll X," not really considering the roll itself.

Like what we normally do, which is hack or houserule a game to suit our way of playing instead of making tons of conscious efforts to change the way we play and adapt to the game... but better. Maybe the old modular approach with simple mechanics that can be changed to suit other ways of GMing or genres (like Moves).<br/><br/>Anyway, speaking of old habits and AW I got from here the idea that whenever a player fails a roll, saying "you miss" and going to the next player is the worst thing you can do. You either say "but..." or better yet, describe how the heroes do their best but the evil guys do something awesome and foil their attacks. I still have to make a conscious effort to get this done, because by default failed rolls and specially botches are always interpreted as humorous failure by our group. That everyone is okay about it doesn't make it better and it even makes the conscious effort a bit more difficult.<br/><br/>So, no wonder why old designs with a twist like 5e and dungeon world become so popular: they let you play in a way you're used to while helping you avoid the usual pitfalls that drove you away from the game that taught to GM that way.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_466115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/466115/#Comment_466115" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-09-06T18:26:04+00:00" title="September  6, 2017  6:26PM">September 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Rafu" rel="nofollow">Rafu</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Quick fix for you: instruct people beforehand that, when you say "Roll X" just like that, they should roll under a cup.
