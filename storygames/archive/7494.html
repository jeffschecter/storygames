The first game went pretty well, and a lot of my players were pretty familiar with the game.  The Nocturne-esque game kind of got hairy mostly because I ended up letting each player define their own Humanity to kind of reflect the various philosophies that some of the major players in Nocturne had.  This kind of caused the game to derail into several out-of-game morality debates over each character's humanity definition, and it kind of caused too much difference between everyone.<br/><br/>If I would suggest anything, it would be Sorcerer + a play-through of Persona 2.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166389/#Comment_166389" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-31T22:34:19+00:00" title="August 31, 2008 10:34PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmm. Here's the thing: You've got me right up until here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite><br/>So, what other systems could be used to play something kind of like that? The less actual rules hacking needs to be done, the better. <b>No traditional systems, please</b>, but edge cases are ok.</blockquote>\nSo, one of the things I'm messing around with is a D&amp;D 4E setting hack for Persona (3). The players have characters which themselves have no stats/skills/etc. The D&amp;D characters themselves are their Persona, but instead of transforming each round, they send their personas into various buildings, temples, etc.<br/><br/>But what I realized, early on, is that there is *absolutely nothing* that is tied to the setting of the game series that needs to be "replicated" somehow in a story sense. You could run a perfectly "thematic" game of Persona with GURPS just as well as you could with PTA:: Actually, IMO GURPS would be a better match to get the summoning stuff into its own system. But I digress. In the end, there's no structure per se that requires a system to prop it up. It's all setting, nothing really to do with the system.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite><br/>There's some Japanese licensed<em>Megaten</em>game apparently. Only, it's in Japanese, and supposedly trad to the bones.</blockquote>\nIt's not that it's trad, so much that it's hundreds of pages of /boring/ trad. It's seeped in the SNES game series system, and from there they just added more and more over the years: With each incarnation of the tabletop game, they simply added more. And more. And more. A lot of data without thinking too much about why, it seems.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166399">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166399/#Comment_166399" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T00:23:38+00:00" title="September  1, 2008 12:23AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not heavily experienced with Persona, but I played one of the early (first?)

I definitely agree with your idea of using Panty Explosion -- I've been trying to write a hack for it for a couple of weeks now.<br/><br/>If you look at the structure of PE, it fits Persona 3 perfectly.  There are minor big-bads (the Major Arcana that show up every month) that you build up to and eventually fight, and its theme colors your interactions with it.  Compare this to the schoolgirls of PE dealing with their own personal issues in a lead up to a fight with a Demon...<br/><br/>At first it looked as if the conversion was merely color - so I wrote up a generalization of the concepts and the mapping from one to the other.  Male students are now available. Demons become Shadows (by the definition given at the end of Persona 3: FES), everyone basically becomes Psychic (a Persona-User) but only during the Dark Hour, etc.  There should be some form of what I call an Otherwhere: Tartarus from Persona 3, or the world inside the television for 4.<br/><br/>And then I realized there were all sorts of subtle things you could shift in the rules to make the themes of Persona really come across...<br/><br/>I wrote up some rules for dice during the Dark Hour -- of how it levels the playing field.  The players are all students who are "special", but only for one hour a day.  The least popular kid is suddenly like everyone else...and so is the most popular.<br/><br/>There's also a whole bunch of ideas/concepts in the games about the Persona themselves: that they're a part of a character's personality that they haven't yet dealt with/matured into (which is really the central concept of the games in general and 3 in particular), dealing with that side of the personality, evoking them, the "Main Character" (the 'new kid' who throws everything into chaos and starts everything happening, which happens in almost all of the entries in the series).<br/><br/>So I've added Tarot cards (particularly the Major Arcana to identify types of Arcana) to the mix, as well as a "New Kid" mechanic and a further one about how using the Personas too much can result in them forcing their personality into your "Day" self (one of your traits has to be based on your Persona - and you don't get to choose the Arcana, it's a random draw).<br/><br/>So, basically, I guess I'm saying that I agree that Panty Explosion is a good fit. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>RE: Megaten -- I feel like the main series (the 3 (?) main Shin Megami Tensei, not including the remakes -- Nocturne is the only one that made it over here, legally <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>) and the Persona spin-off series are two completely different beasts.<br/><br/>Running a Megaten games almost demands a post-apocalyptic setting -- most of the games start or eventually have a moment where the world as we know it ends.  You're left in the ruins with the literal demons of humanity and you choose how it's rebuilt.  Your philosophy colors the ending you get.<br/><br/>Persona feels much more subtle.  Though most play with the idea of Armageddon at the very end, they all take place in the Real World.  Specifically the Real World of high-school aged kids who are trying to find themselves.  It's a personal journey that results in personal change, rather than in Megaten, where your choices are basically imprinted on the world.  If that makes any sense. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Sorcerer seems a great fit for Megaten, since it's basically the occult equivalent of Pokemon.  You deal with demons who join you (pact, anyone?) if you can convince them that you align philosophically (or you seduce them, or you threaten them, etc.)<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166449/#Comment_166449" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T08:43:30+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  8:43AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Filip Luszczyk</cite>they do not offer anything that would actively support this particular setting/color</blockquote>\nI guess that's the question: What does Persona (and I'm assuming we mean 3/4 here) have in the terms of setting/color that need to be preserved?<br/><br/>Here's what I see as the primary important parts (styles, mood, theme) of the console game franchise:<br/><br/>* You control demons ("Persona" in the Persona series, but pretty much Demons in the SMT series) and they fight for you, moreso than fighting yourself. Demons are absolutely under your control.<br/>* Demons can be mixed together to form new/stronger demons.<br/>* Demons have categories they fall under, in the Persona series these categories are based on the major arcana.<br/>* Combat, combat, combat, combat, and combat. Oh, and combat. In a dungeon crawl environment, with no real story to the crawl other than "get to the next stopping point".<br/>* SMT (nor Persona as much, although it is still there to a small degree) encourages almost savant-like obsessiveness about the demons raised/controlled, balancing their abilities, etc; turning them into a tightly controlled, functional stable of tools to use to overcome challenges.<br/>* Combat has an elemental component to it: Ice, Fire, Wind, Bash, Slash, etc. Creatures and people can be strong with one; strong, weak, or unaffected by others.<br/>* The characters are all teenagers/high schoolers set up in an environment where there is little-to-no parental authority.<br/>* The main character interacts with a bunch of background NPCs, to try to "raise their relationship". This later translates to power when summoning demons.<br/>* A lot of things, including NPCs and personal gain, fight for the characters' attention.<br/>* There are a range of characters with different abilities, and they work together as a team. There may be a little character drama, but they are not actively stabbing each other in the face.<br/><br/>So, a majority of the stuff above, the meat of the SMT/Persona franchise, requires a system which handles demon/creature summoning well, in terms of combat, creature "levelling", etc. It should also have a balancing act of elements and attack types, but that doesn't seem as important as creature combat. <br/><br/>I don't know of a system that handles that straight out of the box without modification, other than a generic game like BESM (which actually does have quite a few rules on summoning that work pretty well without a lot of number-crunching, actually).<br/><br/>There is no system which handles a tarot-NPC relationship thing ("increase levels" in a relationship to "increase player level/power level"). There is no system which has rules for the lack of parental authority, although there are many which encourage teamwork.<br/><br/>Also, combat-heavy systems will get fucking boring if you try to grind as much as you do in SMT/Persona combats. That's pretty much the core of the game, though.<br/><br/>Sorcerer wouldn't work, because the demons are absolutely under the characters' control in all regards. At least, if you want to stay true to the concept of SMT/Persona.<br/><br/>To make a long reply short: <br/>1) There's no game out there that will do Persona to tabletop conversion out of the box (given the "important parts to the console franchise", above).<br/>2) A better idea is to find and list *exactly what you like* about the franchise, the parts that are important to you, and that you actually want to bring to the tabletop.<br/>3) Based on those, there may be a game that does a conversion out of the box, or at least without a lot of conversion/hacking.<br/>4) Otherwise, you're looking at hacking a generic/traditional game system into a Persona framework, which is something you said you didn't want to do.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168442/#Comment_168442" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-11T03:40:36+00:00" title="September 11, 2008  3:40AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: peccable</cite><br/>If you look at the structure of PE, it fits Persona 3 perfectly.

About the only thing missing is the Social Links aspect.  I'm 1) not certain I want to include it and 2) not sure what mechanics I'd use if I did.  My hack seems overly-complex enough so far that I don't think I need to be *adding* things. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So here's an excerpt from my draft thus far:<br/><br/>The World of Persona<br/>There are several elements of Persona 3 and 4 that this hack attempts to encompass:<br/><br/>\t* The Awakened, all those with the potential to summon Personas, whether they realize it or not.  This includes: the protagonists, who may start the game knowing as Persona-users or will have to learn how to summon during the course of the game; other students who have not yet awakened, leaving them at the mercy of the Shadows during the Dark Hour (see below); students who are full Persona-Users but choose not to align with the protagonists; and those whose Persona's personality has taken over their own and are on their way to becoming full Shadows.  The Awakened are the Shadow's prey and deadly enemy.  Potential Persona-Users who have not fully awakened are perfect, unprotected targets, but full Persona-Users are the only ones who can directly harm Shadows.<br/><br/>\t* The Shadows, who are the main enemies of the protagonists.  They come in two forms.  The first are smaller, minor Shadows, which are the embodiment of the 'darker' side of a single individual \u2013 literally a Persona out of control.  The second, known as major Shadows, are the embodiment of entire concepts within the collective unconscious, given life and sentience.  The monthly 'bosses' from Persona 3 (based on the first 13 Arcana of the Tarot: the Magician, the Wheel of Fortune, etc) are examples of major Shadows.  There are examples of even larger Shadows, such as Nyx from the end of Persona 3, but these are usually out of the reach of a normal game of Panty Explosion, though one could be used as the culmination of a campaign.<br/><br/>\t* The Lost, the victims of the Shadows.  While Shadows attack physically when they are present during the Dark Hour, the results of such attacks are mental and spiritual damage.  Those whose psyche, the vital spark of their souls, are extinguished by the Shadows are left empty husks.  The doctors call it \u201cApathy Syndrome\u201d and are at a loss to explain its cause.  Most humans, known as the Blind, are safe during the Dark Hour, encased in a coffin-shaped embodiment of their souls.  However, potential Persona-Users have lost this protection in exchange for being aware and awake during the Dark Hour.  They are, as such, perfect victims.<br/><br/>\t* The Dark Hour, a mysterious 25th hour of the day between one day and the next, only accessible to the Awakened.  The world sleeps unknowing during the Dark Hour.  The Blind, locked in their coffin-souls, pass through it unawares.  The rest of the physical world warps \u2013 becoming both more and less.  Technology tends to freeze and fail, and physical locations 'remember' what they've been in the past.  During the Dark Hour, 'psychogeography' becomes the rule: what a place Means is more important that what a place Is.  As such, it is during the Dark Hour that Otherwheres become accessible.  Through this strange, psychic landscape crawl the Shadows, looking for prey.  The Dark Hour always has a particular look and feel to it: in Persona 3, the sky and land are tinged green and the moon becomes huge.<br/><br/>\t* Otherwheres are particularly strong examples of psychogeography.  Both Persona 3 and 4 revolve most of their game-play around an Otherwhere.  In Persona 3, it is the giant tower known as Tartarus that the local High School turns into each Dark Hour.  In Persona 4, it's the world inside of every television \u2013 accessible from anywhere.  Othewheres are massive, labyrinthine structures; shifting, changing mazes which are never the same twice.  Otherwheres are the local source and gathering place of Shadows, and the natural battleground of Persona-Users.  The creation of an Otherwhere is almost always connected to the history of a place.  In Persona 3, Tartarus (and, in FES's "The Answer", the Abyss of Time) was formed on the site of a corporation's attempt to harness Shadows for their own ends.<br/><br/>\t* Evokers are how Persona-Users bring forth their hidden selves.  It's usually a physical object or act.  In Persona 3, students place an Evoker shaped like a pistol to their heads and pull the trigger, metaphorically 'dying' from one personality to be born into another.  In Persona 4, the characters all wear glasses and use cards to summon Personas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_168625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/168625/#Comment_168625" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-12T08:10:02+00:00" title="September 12, 2008  8:10AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/><br/>\t* The Velvet Room, a place of transition where Igor and his assistant live.  Igor is a mysterious figure who shows up in all of the Persona games and never leaves the Room.  He acts as advisor and teacher, explaining Personas and their power to those who enter the Room \u2013 a space partly of the Dark Hour, partly of our world and accessible from both.  In the last two Persona games, the transition theme of the Room came through in its appearance.  In Persona 3, the room looks like a giant elevator, with lights constantly flashing through the gated 'door' at the back.  At the end of the game, the Room reaches its final destination and the door opens.  In Persona 4, the Room takes on the appearance of a limousine, with dimmed windows which flash occasionally.  Igor's assistant is always female, and has changed from game to game.  The implication is that she works in the Room towards some end - either the fulfilment of a promise, or waiting for someone to arrive.<br/><br/>\t* The Wild Card is the new element thrown into the existing situation.

Either the Superintendent or the players as a group should create some of the details for these elements at the same time the school is designed.  What is the local Otherwhere?  How are Persona summoned?  What does the Dark Hour look like?  Is there a local, rival group of Persona-Users that have no interest in fighting the Shadows, but would rather use their powers to their own ends?  Not all of the details need to be work out in advance, but having a thematic idea of where things are going is always a good idea.<br/><br/><br/>...so that's what I'm going for, anyway.  All of the mechanics support what's listed here: attacks against Shadows have to be done using Personas in order to be effective, there's a New Kid who has a Wild Card power and basically replaces the Psychic Girl in PE -- he/she can never be the most popular, etc.<br/><br/>I'm *definitely* dumping the whole fighting/leveling thing.  The players might describe their adventures through an Otherwhere (like Tartarus), leading up to a fight with the Big Bad, but it's not going to be a dungeon crawl.<br/><br/>So, Filip -- back to your original question: what parts of Persona are you hoping to capture in your game?  What do you see the players doing from session to session?  Your mentioning of "leveling up" implies that you *are* trying to capture the "grinding" nature of the games.<br/><br/>-d-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
