Let me elaborate.<br/><br/>So I was reading the discussions on marketing and it got me thinking about a phenomenon that has bothered me since the day I encountered The Forge.  I'm not like other gamers, even some fellow "story" gamers.  Something that a lot of gamers seem to have that I don't is the ability to get excited about visual imagery.  Show them a picture of an astronaut wielding a ray gun while ridding a dinosaur on the moon fighting nazis in battlemechs and their eyes light up!  They gesticulate wildly and talk about how much they want a game like THAT!<br/><br/>That doesn't work for me.  It just doesn't.  I don't know why.  I'm just a Story Now preferenced player and if there isn't some tangible emotional issue at stake in the fiction it just doesn't interest me.  As a friend of mine put it, "You like games that raise emotional questions."  Yes!  That's what excites me, even on a visual level because even images can provoke emotional questions. After all I seem to be one of the few people who instinctively understood why there's wererats in It Was A Mutual decision before I even knew anything else about the game.  Don't know what that says about me and relationships.<br/><br/>Anyway, my main point here is that if it weren't for me discovering The Forge when I did there's a very real possibility I wouldn't be in this hobby anymore.  My games weren't doing what I wanted them to do.  I didn't even really have the vocabulary to express what I wanted them to do.  I just had this vague emotional idea of what I wanted out of play and the games I was playing at the time weren't delivering.  The only reason I stuck it out long enough to discover The Forge and then stuck it out even LONGER to delve through Ron's notions about Story Now was because (a) I'm academically inclined and (b) I'm stubborn.<br/><br/>My point is that that's a pretty unique combination not likely to be found in a whole lot of other people.  However, I think my creative desires are lot more widely spread.  I suspect there are a number of people who (a) never encountered RPGs before or (b) when they encountered RPGs encountered some variant of D&amp;D or Vampire or Call of Cthulhu and being more like me in preference but unlike me in stubbornness simply said, "Eh, not for me." and walked away.  Had these people encountered My Life with Master or Dogs in the Vineyard or Sorcerer *first* they might still be here.  Hell, they might be designing games we can't even conceive of right now.<br/><br/>So how do we find these people?  How would you market to me, had I said, "Aw, fuck it." back in 2000?<br/><br/>Jesse                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs" title="jessecoombs"><img alt="jessecoombs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/489/nT0DUYNVHEDTB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jessecoombs">jessecoombs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236648/#Comment_236648" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T12:39:22+00:00" title="October  9, 2009 12:39PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One person at a time. In other words, the type of people you are talking about have already written off most gaming and are doing other things with their free time. So I simply am upfront on the games I like and why I like them. I do my best to not compare them to D&amp;D or World of Warcraft so as not to plant any negative connotations. I'm also trying hard to run games for people I don't know that well. <br/><br/>I like to use a sky-diving analogy in my head. <br/>"What are you doing tomorrow?"<br/>"I'm going sky-diving."<br/>"Really? Wow."<br/>"Yeah, it's fun. Want to go with us?"<br/>"Um, I don't know."<br/>"Well, you don't have to jump or anything, but you can hang out and ask questions and then we'll go out for food afterwards."<br/>"I don't want to get in the way and I don't really know what I would be supposed to do..."<br/>"You won't get in the way, and we would really appreciate a new face to shoot the shit with."<br/>"I'll think about it."<br/>"Cool. And if you can't come tomorrow, we do this once a month at Smith's Airfield around 2."<br/><br/>Just replace sky-diving with role-playing, which I think is more exciting anyway. Anyway, sorry about the long reply, but my point is that I think it's kind of impossible to mass market to those who have turned off of rpgs because that's most of the rest of the world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236651/#Comment_236651" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T12:45:30+00:00" title="October  9, 2009 12:45PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jessecoombs</cite>One person at a time.</blockquote>\nYeah.

But, I'm increasingly convinced you're not reachable <i>to any degree that's worth the resources required</i>.<br/><br/>I think that the indie scene reached disgruntled gamers like you somewhat effectively. I did it myself. Occasionally, people -- Judd Karlman among them -- tell me that had they never discovered Dust Devils, they might never have gotten involved in indie RPGs. That makes me smile! I love that.<br/><br/>The growth among players interested in story games / narrativist games / whatever-you-wish-to-call-them has been ... just ok. In my view, it's a slow crawl, and should have been more like a limping gait.<br/><br/>My current thinking is that instead of beating our heads against the wall (i.e. "wasting" resources) trying to recruit any of the following: non-gamers, gamer girlfriends, disavowed gamers, tangentially related hobbyists (i.e. BSG fans or something), etc. should be a secondary (at best) goal. <br/><br/>Instead, I think the goal should be convincing active gamers that our games aren't so fucking weird and emotionally threatening, and that they infact want the hell out of them.<br/><br/>Now, along the way, I'd love to see some of the innovative techniques we discovered along the way, get slightly subversive, and blow some minds in a good way. But, wrap it all up in something the broader pool of slightly-less-than-super-hardcore gamers would want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_236701">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236701/#Comment_236701" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T14:47:42+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  2:47PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Are you asking how to provoke that curiosity among the folks at gaming conventions ho are currently giving you disturbed looks of distrust and maybe disgust?

But given Matt's response who sort of prompted my post in the first place, I'm also interested in the former.

Just making sure I'm clear on that.<br/><br/>At least within the established-gamer (and lapsed-gamer) populations, you have a positive mind-share already dedicated to the activity. Once you go outside that, you're now in recruitment territory. Recruiting someone into a new leisure activity these days is TOUGH, man. I'm not even sure how to couch the value proposition in contrast to low-cost (web, pirated media content, TV), low-investment (TV/movies, house parties, drinking), high-engagement (video games, sports, online communities), or even high-creative (blogging, desktop moviemaking, fanfic) competing activities. We live in an era blessed with an embarrassment of riches when it comes to amusing ourselves.<br/><br/>My gut says recruitment is something that happens, and will always happen, at the personal level.
