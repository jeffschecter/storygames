Be prepared to take drastic measures and go along with dramatic turn of events.</blockquote>\nYou talk much about "excitement" and "enjoyable", but not how to use the tools to make it that. The thing is, trying to come up with new <i>surprising</i> things can block the mind. Be boring; say obvious things; something will grow out of that when people are starting to give each others' ideas a spin.<br/><br/>That is something I miss in your text - the advice to build on each others' ideas. It's possible that you talk about it in the first point under Be Generous, but you should then break that paragraph into two bits to make it more obvious. It seems more like you're into the idea that there should be one story for each player.\n<blockquote>Be transparent and share your intentions openly.</blockquote>\nOh, yeah! This is spot on! It's also connected to what you write later, namely ...\n<blockquote>... and being open where the story may evolve in the future.</blockquote>\nThis also goes with what you said about don't plan ahead. I usually have a strive of where I want things to go, but I never plan specific moments (well, I do ... and I can always make it work, but ignore that). Do I want a sad story? A heroic one? Shall two players realize something about each other?<br/><br/>Having a fixed idea of what will happen, often to bring a surprise to the other participants, can block the mind.\n<blockquote>Give yourself enough space to be suprised each scene where the story is going, possibly in ways you never thought of.</blockquote>\nSo true! What I cherish a lot, when playing collaborative storytelling, is to see how things change when others starts contributing. Even if they say, what they think is, the most boring and obvious thing it's still something refreshing for the other participants.\n<blockquote>If you don't like the way the game or story develops,</blockquote>\nTalk if you don't like something. Be open. Be transparent. Discuss if there is anything uncertain about what happened. Sometimes it's even good to replay scenes if it didn't feel right. (I was really opposed replaying scenes, but as soon as I tried it I changed my mind.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ArtPatient" title="ArtPatient"><img alt="ArtPatient" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ArtPatient">ArtPatient</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445726/#Comment_445726" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-19T12:40:08+00:00" title="June 19, 2015 12:40PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            NIce round set of guidelines for producing collaborative stories.<br/><br/>The thing I always have the most trouble with is inviting the unexpected. Obviously, the players in an RPG depend on the GM to provide this for them and the GM gets some unexpected things back, too. But as a story teller/GM, it isn't always so obvious when a good time to throw something new in the mix. Players often want to include things that don't fit the GM's setting.<br/><br/>For example, how <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20070/actual-play-example-directions-storyplaying-system/p1" rel="nofollow">Scene 4, Step 4</a> is Beth inspired to have Heather proclaim her love for Gerry?<br/><br/>Are there are more specific principles that you use in actual play when to introduce something new? That would be useful for me, and perhaps others.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445730/#Comment_445730" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-19T22:05:08+00:00" title="June 19, 2015 10:05PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 19, 2015 10:05PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi BeePeeGee,<br/><br/>I largely agree with Rickard, with the caveat that brevity is good so you should probably limit such high-level orientation text to just the most important stuff.<br/><br/>Much of what you've written is familiar to me, but the one part that stood out is "flow over form".  That's a unique way to look at that dynamic, somewhere between freeform and Rule Zero.  If there's any part that deserves highlighting or elaboration, this might be it.  (Or, I might just be biased because I dig flow over form.)<br/><br/>On that topic, I'd just like to throw out one way I look at it; compare and contrast as you see fit.  <i>The rules are there to help get you <b>into</b> the state of flow/immersion/total engagement with the fiction.  Once you're in, then you don't need the game's formal structures (rules); use them only insofar as it seems natural and doesn't distract.  At some point, the flow will wane -- at that point, go back to the rules again to fuel your next journey.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445731/#Comment_445731" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-20T04:07:28+00:00" title="June 20, 2015  4:07AM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a good perspective, David.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445732/#Comment_445732" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-06-20T12:51:29+00:00" title="June 20, 2015 12:51PM">June 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the feedback, guys.<br/><br/>Rickard: thanks for all the details. I will include your feedback in revisions.<br/>For what I have in mind, the guiding principles need only answer the "<i>how</i>" to interact and play with each other. Thus, some things you address are covered in the <i>rules</i> of the game as well as setting development. The rest will be covered later.<br/><br/>ArtPatient: thanks for returning to my game play example. I have completely changed/refined quite a bit of the mechanics since then. Now, it has a better flow, focus on roleplaying (less "play before play"). <br/>"Inviting the unexpected" is covered with specific mechanics using a designated "surprise meter" as well as game-specific random tables. (I'll post a draft some later time).<br/><br/>David/Asif: Spot on. That's what I had in mind with "flow over form"! The <i>Directions Storyplaying System</i> use the rules as flexible building blocks or training wheels. You are free to modify/drop them as seem fit for your game/story.<br/>This is a much different attitude than i.e. Luke Crane's designs that seem to go "flow follows form", meaning: "stick exactly to the rules and you'll have a terrific Burning Wheel/Mouse Guard experience".<br/><br/>And yes, brevity helpful, especially in the introductary sections. So, it's interesting what is redundant or can be left out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
