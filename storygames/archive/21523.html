However, surely once that environment is set, the setting becomes more granular and less spontaneous. There are only so many deserted graveyards, abandoned churches and patches of forbidding woodland that can logically be squeezed into an area, and unless the school has a real retention issue, the defined staff and pupils are very soon going to reach the point where there is no more room for another Goth Weirdo Loner or Rich Slutty Champion Cheerleader.<br/><br/>Do long-term players find this to be the case? Has it caused problems, or do they see it potentially being an issue? How would you deal with it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470673/#Comment_470673" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T14:40:53+00:00" title="March 15, 2018  2:40PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I understand you correctly, you are quite right.

Now this is obviously true to a large extent, they create and alter things to provide entertaining dialogue and situations. A (fairly tired) example might be a vampire who describes at the start how the popular school quarterback is a fabulously handsome athlete who is desperately in love with her but she keeps teasing and shunning him.<br/><br/>Once the game is underway, however, the opportunity to alter things becomes more limited. That quarterback is set within the story and that means that the werewolf can't suddenly make the school quarterback into a 'never been in love' troglodyte-like slob who barely made the team and only has the position because he's the coach's nephew.<br/><br/>Yeah, there are certainly ways that the story could twist to create the situation, but the point is that, once created and set into the story, it is harder to use that freedom established at the start to pick setting components out of thin air to suit the story you have in mind for your own character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470684">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470684/#Comment_470684" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T20:19:55+00:00" title="March 15, 2018  8:19PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2018 8:50PM by DeReel.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not specifically about Monsterheart, with which I have no play experience. The general idea in manipulating the setting is not that it's satisfying per se. Players like it because it is perfectly fitting with their characters and they are emotionally invested in it.<br/>I'd redefine the problem like this : if a group of players has already been playing, and their characters are tightly adjusted to each other, there will be less and less room for a new player, with a new character (issues / etc.). Characters orthogonal to each other is easy for 2 or 3. 4 to 5 requires thinking, but not too much. Past 6, I have a problem with information management. A character needs "readability", just like siblings in a family.<br/>A solution : retcon, not the hard facts, but the consensual interpretation of them. Redefine the Vampire's ground and herd to maximize the interest of their interactions with the Werewolf. The game is for the players, not some kind of cult.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470685">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470685/#Comment_470685" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-15T20:19:59+00:00" title="March 15, 2018  8:19PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2018 8:20PM by DannyK.">edited March 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At least the way I\u2019ve played Monsterhearts, the players don\u2019t create places and NPCs unless invited to do so by the MC. The MC invites that a lot, especially at the beginning, but over time you build up a cast. Then it\u2019s preferable to re-use established locations and NPCs that have some history. <br/>I guess if a player asked about a big nerdy guy who\u2019s on the football team I\u2019d allow it, as long as it didn\u2019t conflict with established fact or we could retcon it. (Steve the boring quarterback broke his leg, so now we have Franz the existential quarterback). One of the 11 players in the team suddenly became more interesting so now he has a name and personality. But if big nerdy guy is now the focus of the session, that means a bunch of other NPCs are in the background.<br/>You\u2019re underestimating how easy it is to let NPCs and locations fade into the background if nobody is actively engaging them. My secluded spot in the woods might or might be your secluded spot in the woods, but who cares if both aren\u2019t being actively used in the game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" title="Sadurian"><img alt="Sadurian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sadurian">Sadurian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470697/#Comment_470697" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-16T10:21:59+00:00" title="March 16, 2018 10:21AM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what's coming across is that people don't find players have a problem with changing setting elements (and I include NPCs in that), so long as that setting element isn't important to any one of them.<br/><br/>DeReel's point about information overload is another issue, of course - just how many of these NPCs are you going to have to fill in detail and keep track of? I guess that comes down to the players and play style - in my experience (of other RPGs) some groups are happy to remember the mayor as 'that fat guy with the speech impediment' whereas others like to use more background detail in their plans ('the mayor has a daughter who likes the doctor's son, so we can use that to our advantage').<br/><br/>I appreciate the feedback and now have a better idea of what the game might throw at me. I am one of those wierdos who like run running or playing a game through in my head in order to examine it for potholes and weak spots. I imagine situations and see how the mechanics or ethos would deal with it. Sort of meta-RPG playing, I suppose - role-playing role-playing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_470699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470699/#Comment_470699" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-16T12:38:26+00:00" title="March 16, 2018 12:38PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Sadurian" rel="nofollow">Sadurian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I think what's coming across is that people don't find players have a problem with changing setting elements (and I include NPCs in that), so long as that setting element isn't important to any one of them.</p></div></blockquote>\nI do think "changing setting elements" is going to be a problem in the vast majority of RPGs. However, there's no "change" when the element had not been set in the first place.<br/>What I recommend, then, is that you don't over-define. Specifically, only detail setting elements and NPCs <i>as they become important</i>.<br/><br/>Even with Monsterhearts' "small town" setting, there's still a whole town in the background, with thousands of inhabitants (at least) and probably hundreds of high school students. Even for the smallest viable location, where it <i>would</i> be feasible (if a lot of work) to name every single human in advance, why do that? <br/>There's this faceless crowd to draw from and have individualized NPCs shape up at needed. As someone else pointed up above, there's a minimum of 11 players on a football team - except perhaps if you have a very football-centered game, with multiple PCs on the team, you aren't going to detail or even name them all in advance. When a football player with so-and-so personality is needed, you just "zoom in" on a previously unacknowledged character, or perhaps one you just name-dropped once as an afterthought - you flesh them out as you give them screen time. Same for locations, really: no matter how small the town is, you're probably never going to run out of backdrops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_470794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti" title="lorenzogatti"><img alt="lorenzogatti" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lorenzogatti">lorenzogatti</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/470794/#Comment_470794" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-03-19T12:43:00+00:00" title="March 19, 2018 12:43PM">March 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Undeveloped setting details as a limited resource can be considered from the opposite perspective: once developed, you don't need to develop more, only to develop the same ones deeper and deeper. <br/>What could be really exhausted are NPCs, locations etc. that all players have had enough of and cannot stand any more, but even these can be altered and become new and interesting again (as the rules for successive "seasons" already suggest).<br/><br/>For example, after the football team quarterback has been <i>shaped</i> (from clay, so to speak, by adding details to an implicit social position, not <i>changed</i> from a preexisting proper character) to serve as the Vampire's love interest there's an interesting NPC on the stage, who is going to offer a lot of opportunity for adventure to all characters: following quarterback tradition, he might be someone else's love interest, he could be involved in plots about the football team, about his friends or relatives, about his secrets and other facets of his personality, or even as a random passerby. The MH manual itself recommends complicating existing characters with novel, conflicting roles and relationships over introducing throwaway single-purpose characters.<br/><br/>Similarly, who needs more than one deserted graveyard? Having multiple sinister parties meet on the same moonless night because they have no choice of graveyard is an opportunity! Moreover, in a game with many graveyard amateurs multiple graveyards would probably be silly.<br/>Even if the only location of a certain class is destroyed, exploring how PCs and NPCs carry on without it is a potentially important campaign development, not a problem that needs to be solved with a replacement location.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
