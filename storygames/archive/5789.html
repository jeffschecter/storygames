The "dream ticket" in hobby games is to have your IP recognized in a larger market and licensed or sold. Mechwarrior/battletech being an example of old.<br/><br/>I find Ken Hite's statement interesting... but not unsurprising. It seems to me that GURPS' shelf space share has been shrinking for a while, and more and more backstock is on sale at the SJ Games boot every gencon... and fewer and fewer GURPS books are published that are making the rounds as "the book to buy on the subject regardless of which system you are using."<br/><br/>On the other hand, I wandered across 2 threads in SG this morning that lament SotC's size... but it's one of the ones getting more play and with the mass market appeal. (It's also pretty much the reason I found my way to SG.)<br/><br/>Dogs in the Vinyard vs. Vampire does surprise me a little. It did acheive RPGnet darling status, but that rarely translates directly into play time. Though I had heard nWoD isn't as popular with its fanbase as oWoD though, they still seem to pull in relatively strong sales numbers from what few sources I have seen, whereas DitV seems a popular indie choice, I still wouldn't have suspected that it would compete with a big mainstream player like vampire when it comes to filling out tables at a con. Which makes me suspect something I'm not seeing is going on here.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_129780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129780/#Comment_129780" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-23T12:56:51+00:00" title="February 23, 2008 12:56PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It should be noted that GURPS is definitely a second-place concern for SJG these days.

The 4e offerings have been more compelling to me, at least. I like the slower release schedule, and the nifty niche PDF products they've been doing (like the "dungeon-crawling with GURPS" series) sound pretty fun.

But for the next few years, no.  "Footprint" yes.  And I gathered this from the DundraCon State of the Industry panel.  The brick and mortar shops are the life blood of the industry. They've adapted in a very important way, to survive with discounts you can get from online purchases, or the feel-good direct-buy from the publisher, and that's having demo space.  Places for people to play games, and most importantly, show off the stock they're selling. Many, if not most, game stores that are still around have shifted to this model. Places like Endgame in the Bay Area use it to help stock and sell their indie games, and make a big production out of it.<br/><br/>Now, in the further future, I can see things like MapTools but more useful for general online play, so people can easily hop on to try out a game, so they can get sold on it and then they could play online or at the table. But in order for there to be an audience, there has to be a way for the audience to be created and grow, and currently, online isn't close to being able to do that. The best its been able to do is raise awareness and inform people of where they can go in the real world to try out a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_130771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130771/#Comment_130771" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T05:53:15+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  5:53AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, the question is which is the cause, and which is the effect? That is, do they do well with Munchkin, which causes them to ignore GURPS, which causes the lack of play? Or do they find people not playing GURPS, and so move into doing more Munchkin? Is the producer driving the market here? No, that's just not how it works. Why, if GURPS was still potentially profitable, would they scale it back? Because they can't hire any more people to manage their lines? <br/>\n<br/>\nNo, I'm afraid that it's because GURPs has a dwindling audience. Note that it's still a huge audience, and in some ways bigger than the DitV audience, and most others. It's just that said audience pretty much has purchased all they want from the line. I know that I have. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I'm indicative of a large segment of their profitability: people who purchase GURPS books, but do not play much, if any, GURPS. <br/>\n<br/>\nPut another way, I happen to know quite a few of the "Men in Black" (MiBs), who are the SJG demo team. And from what I understand from those I've talked to (mostly at Origins), they've scaled back demos of the game, because people weren't attending them. Is the scaled back production cycle that they have giving off a perception that the line is "dead?" No, it's still very much alive. So you can't argue that people are fleeing the system as some irrationally do, because of some lack of support from SJG. No, the company is simply responding to the turn in the market. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know that this has anything to do with indie games taking market-share, by the way. I think it simply has to do with the fact that GURPs has somewhat "run it's course." Meaning that the fourth edition isn't really any better than previous editions of the game, and people are starting to really get tired of the problems that the system has. It's generic nature, and many plug-ins no longer are benefits that they can't get elsewhere with possibly more useable products like Savage Worlds. Or tri-stat. Or... well I could go on and on. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your point, JD, was simply that SJG won't be hurt by this, I'd agree. Steve Jackson, out of all producers of games, knows how to weather the times. But that's not to say that it isn't indicative of a market shift away from playing GURPS. People want something else. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat goes double, by the way, for Hero Games, which despite being arguably a more mechanically well-balanced game (GURPS does actually catch up in some supplements, but only at the expense of making their game even less palatable than Hero makes itself), suffers from a perception that it is very difficult to use. It's probably well-nigh impossible to get folks to play champions these days, for any extended play. I, myself, occasionally go through bouts of character generation, even with new folks, but nothing ever comes of it in terms of actual play. <br/>\n<br/>\nHero system is, to me, a treatise on how abilities balance mechanically. Which means that it's really best theoretically, and not in practice. Interestingly, the fact that a computer can handle all of the complexities of play instantly means that I have *always* thought that the Hero System should be the engine for an online game. Even before there were online games. I think this is where it's strengths will shine through. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's because...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130780/#Comment_130780" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T06:18:07+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  6:18AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Continued from above)<br/>\n<br/>\n...it has always tended to play like a computer game anyhow. So does D&amp;D. And, lo, D&amp;D's most powerful incarnation to date is the World of Warcraft, with far more people playing it than ever before. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, one could argue that WOW is not D&amp;D. And to be sure, there are folks who put elements into play in D&amp;D that make it very different than WOW. But there have always been a strong contingent of D&amp;D players - perhaps even the majority - who, if you'll pardon the zen shorthand, "rollplay" only. At Origins last year, I was roped into playing a very short and enjoyable session of D&amp;D by some folks from the RPGA who we got to know. As I've commented about that session, it had one of the clearest statements of Creative Agenda intents I have ever heard right up front. The GM said, "There will be no roleplaying." We all got what he meant. It was a tactical exercise, and we were to treat it so. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, one could consider this an exception, but I, for one, have been part of groups where, if not quite this level of specificity of rejection of character identification existed, it was darn close. Like the one game I participated in where people were shocked that my character didn't want to kill the kobolds we came across, but instead wanted to trap them to sell as slaves. It was quite as though I had proposed the same thing in WOW. Except that in WOW it simply can't be done. The GM in the tabletop game adapted, and ran OK. But it was clear that this wasn't how they normally played. Monsters were there to extract EXP from by killing them. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, lo, all of these same players now play WOW, and don't play D&amp;D. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not the first person to note this (I can't recall who I'm paraphrasing, however), but no amount of half-way move to the internet is going to save D&amp;D. Rather, what will be left in terms of D&amp;D players, are those who really do want what is unique to tabletop RPGs (which is a whole 'nother thread). <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, for them, why not provide whatever tools you can in order to enhance play: Sure. But the fact is that for people who are obsessed with things like tactical maps, WOW will not only suffice for these people, but do it better than any such implementation. WOW is, in fact, the evolution of D&amp;D to what these people want. So anything short of it will not do anything. It'll just seem like half an attempt. <br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D will also be saved by simple inertia, of course, but that's missing the point about where the designers need to go. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nParty finders? Chat play clients? How are these new? The fact is that these tools have existed now for over a decade, and are as successful as they're going to get at getting people together to play. WotC putting out a new site that does these things won't change this much at all. "Campaign organizers?" Again, not new. even full clients? Neverwinter nights, anyone? <br/>\n<br/>\nTabletop RPGs need to "move" to the online environment? They already have. As much as they're going to. Yeah, somebody will do a better implementation than the last guy, and his game might sell better because of it. But it's going to be precisely as important as other support to whether or not the game plays well. <br/>\n<br/>\nMeaning that for TTRPGs, the numero uno question of which game will be played will continue to be the quality of the rules and how fun the play is. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a real question as to whether or not we TTRPGers are simply luddites, refusing to move on to MMORPGS. But we know that the reason for this is that no MMORPG has been created that can handle most of the creative agendas that are employed in TTRPG play. Only one, "pawn-stance gamism" is supported well by MMORPGs at this point. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if somebody ever figures out how to actually port the flexibility of a TTRPG to on online engine? Then the real question will be asked as to why anyone would play a non-online RPG. We'll have to wait and see if that ever emerges. But simply having tools online to facilitate Tabletop play? That's not it, no. It's sorta headed in that direction, but there's still a quantum leap that nobody has made yet.

This was fine in HEROs case, as Hero Designer is, afaict, the best piece of chargen software yet made. D&amp;D 3.5's products less so. I went the route of PCGen, which while one of the better D&amp;D products, is clunky and only has so many data set available. I honestly avoided using any supplements that didn't have PCGen support, as it was too labor-intensive to go manual or create my own data sets.<br/><br/>If the chargen app that will be part of D&amp;D Interactive gets regularly updated with supplements and does all the basic math, I'll be happy to fork over my money to WotC. And, really, isn't that a win for them? They got my money.<br/><br/>Not to mention, I use www.d20srd.org all the time. I'll probably miss than more than anything once I start playing 4e.

Having been involved with Virtual Tabletops, we call 'em VTs ;-), for about 3 years now, I have really seen the online gaming aspect increasing and growing in strength. The recent announcement by WotC moving to a online game table has only increased the awareness of the many applications out there today to facilitate online gaming. Software such as Maptool, Battlegrounds, Fantasy Grounds, and ViewingDale are very capable systems that can enable many players to game who are unable to get around a table every week. Sure there will always be those of us who are able to get together with friends locally, but for many of us with busy lives, families, hectic schedules, or who travel for their jobs, sometimes the only way to get a game going is via one of these applications. Frankly, some of the most interesting games I have participated in were ones with a GM in the UK, players in the US, Germany, Australia and Japan!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe ability for VTs to reach truly large audiences, larger than most conventions could hope to reach, I think will sell it in the end. If it comes down to traveling about North America to 10+ conventions to promote your game, or pushing it out digitally....it really is a matter of economics and numbers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_131318">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/131318/#Comment_131318" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-28T13:38:30+00:00" title="February 28, 2008  1:38PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 28, 2008 1:40PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You were missing the nature of my dismissal, Mark.

The only "innovation" that I can see with what might be coming out with D&amp;D4e (note the "might"), is the integration of the functions listed. Like... here's a flow I could envision:<br/>\n - A GM sets up a game account, that includes details on where the game is going to happen, level of roleplaying focus, etc. <br/>\n - players read about the games that have been set up, and apply to play in whichever looks to meet their criteria. <br/>\n - The GM accepts or rejects players.<br/>\n - Accepted players would then be able to move into the character generation module, which would give limited options based on what's appropriate to the GM's set up. If it's in the world of Greyhawk, you have to specify which Greyhawk homeland your character is from, etc. It then suggests religion for the character based on race and/or homeland. Weapon options presented are appropriate to the world in question. You get the idea. Basically it gives the player guidance on the GM's requirements, even without communication between those two parties. <br/>\n - Optimally discussion would be facilitiated here between accepted players. Maybe you can't move into chargen until a quorum is met. Maybe even a meta-point system for players to bid on certain roles? Or maybe if you want to play a mage, you just join into a game with your criteria where nobody yet has taken that concept. Maybe you propose a character concept in your application to play the game? Lots of ways to do this. <br/>\n - Chargen is finished up. Including leveling up characters to a certain point for groups that want to begin at higher than first level. Including modeling tools to show damage output expectation with the combination of feats selected, and other such tools. <br/>\n - Then the system would look at the GM's selected starting point, and present him with adventures to run for the characters. The GM selects one.<br/>\n - The adventure opens, and delivers flava text and intro to the players. <br/>\n - Once players have read the text, their characters are placed on the game-map, and play of the adventure begins. <br/>\n - The GM uses integrated tools to create task resolution requirements for players, or the adventure prompts the GM to ask for them at the right points on the map.<br/>\n - The character accounts are automatically updated to record status changes such as damage, or poison, or spell-effects. As well as calculating encumberance for loot carried, etc (the choice to play with this option is a toggle that the GM sets). <br/>\n - leveling up is triggered when enough EXP are available, and the GM allows it. At which point the player is put back into the character generation system to level up  the character. <br/>\n - If/when the GM wants the characters to go off and do other things, he has tools to create maps and adventures of his own. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm probably missing a lot here. But if you had all of this like I'm explaining it, each with labor-saving synergies, then you have something that improves on the current tools available. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut the issue is that, the more features you put in, the more restrictive the game engine has to become... or the less efficient it is if open. Like, let's say you can put in your own monster descriptions (or download them from other people). That takes work, and makes the game more like it was when it was just tabletop. The system just facilitiates the handling of the object once entered. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can automate all of this by having a single restricted environment where everything works by mechanism. At which point, however, you have WOW. <br/>\n<br/>\nDo you see my point? If they're simply travelling along the same spectrum of functionality, then WOW is the complete evolution. What they have to do to innovate is figure out how to empower the flexibility of tabletop into that environment. And simply allowing for MUD-like object creation isn't quite it. In fact I'm not sure what is. Or if there's really anything that *can* be done here. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
