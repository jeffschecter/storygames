Back to this topic again.<br/><br/>This time, however, hopefully it's simple question that we don't need to argue over.<br/><br/>* Some games have you "set stakes", so you know what sort of danger you're facing, before you roll. Often, this is negotiated.<br/>* In a Wicked Age... lets you roll first, find out who the winner is, <i>then</i> negotiate the outcome.<br/><br/>My question is: how do these feel different, for you, in play? What kind of behaviour do they bring out:<br/><br/>* Do they create different fiction?<br/>* Do they create a different social dynamic?<br/><br/>For instance, I could see how negotiating beforehand might lead people to go into "riskier" situations. Maybe I would be more likely to say "yes" to the outcome "you lose your leg" if I had a feeling I could trust my luck for the next roll. Because it's not for sure; only a risk. Perhaps, in "afterwards" negotiation, I would never have agree to lose my leg.<br/><br/>Or is it the other way around? Maybe I'm more likely to accept the loss of my leg once I know for sure that I've been defeated, whereas it would be too scary to risk that upfront.<br/><br/>In theory, given robots that are not moved by emotion instead of human players, it seems like it would be the same: they decide what they want to risk, and deny anything greater. Mechanically, those two subject the opponents to exactly the same level of risk. But we're not robots. <br/><br/>So, how does it feel, to you, at the table? Is one "safer" than the other? More or less predictable?<br/><br/>And how does it influence the fiction? Does it create different types of stories? Again, more or less predictable in terms of outcomes?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177297/#Comment_177297" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T12:36:59+00:00" title="November  4, 2008 12:36PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I enjoy resolution systems where I roll first, look at my options, and then make decisions. It lets me buy in quickly which builds patience for more handling time after the roll. I'm not sure how it affects the fiction.

Outcome is realization of intention behind action.  Consequences are the results of the realization of that intention.  For example, I attack someone in Primetime Adventures with a sword swinging at his legs.  I make it clear that I'm not trying to kill him so I set the Stakes at "Do I injure him?"  We play cards.  I win.  High Card player says, "You bring the sword down and cut off his leg."<br/><br/>No negotiation.  I got my intention.  High Card tells me the Consequences.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177302/#Comment_177302" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T13:00:13+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  1:00PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>Good clarification.

So in that regard I don't really see any difference between Primetime Adventures and In A Wicked Age except that in Primetime Adventures there's an explicit step for clarifying intention behind your action.  That's something I usually do in In A Wicked Age or Sorcerer anyway because it means I'm confused about the fiction rather than as an opportunity to safe-guard, control or hedge the consequences.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177360/#Comment_177360" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-05T07:48:40+00:00" title="November  5, 2008  7:48AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, so I'll bite. Tell me if you've seen this in play or not:<br/><br/>If we're negotiating _afterwards_, based on a default injury/effect, we might be inclined to be less creative, but more coherent. We might be less likely to come up with interesting twists and events, rather defaulting to mechanical injury/effect or the straight-out consequences of the actions narrated.<br/><br/>If we're negotiating _before_, we might be more likely to come up with more creative twists and events, since we're presented with a creative challenge--"how could things get worse for this character than simply losing?" On the other hand, the consequence isn't flowing directly from the narrated actions of the next round, so it could, at times, seem less organic or coherent (in terms of the fiction).<br/><br/>So, that's a hypothetical. Has anyone seen this in play? Or the opposite? (I could particularly see the opposite effect in terms of coherent fiction, for instance, depending on how the players take it.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
