In the game Cosmic Encounter, getting compensated when the other side attacks your negotiators can sometimes be well worth it. You are trading ships for cards.<br/><br/>Contrasted, in Fate and in D&amp;D 5e, getting a fate point / inspiration when you put your PC in serious risk isn't <i>really</i> commensurate with the risk you take on. You have an aspect "fight poachers", you hear about poachers, and you get compelled to get into a dangerous fight with them. You might take serious losses in that fight, much more that the puny reward of one fate token was worth. However\u2026 that reward is still an affordance marker -- the game's way of telling you "hey! Starting fights with poachers is <i>legit and allowed gameplay</i>!"<br/><br/>Part of the infamous Taschenlampenfallerlasser (flashlight dropper) argument was that the PC hadn't failed a will check, hadn't any mechanical reason to drop the flashlight. Well, that's what affordance markers are there to solve. Affordance markers are like the satisfying click to a good button. They're just a "yes, you can do this, you'll even be rewarded".<br/><br/>That said, insp saved a PCs life last session. They're <i>usually</i> not commensurate but can <i>sometimes</i> really turn the tide.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475103/#Comment_475103" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-30T06:39:50+00:00" title="June 30, 2018  6:39AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's insightful.

Which, yes, some do anyway. Our group does. I remember once we had a new player, we were playing WFRP 3, and he was, hmm, he used an ablist expression but to the extent of expressing surprise over how we were harming ourselves. Having affordance markers could've helped in that situation, helped legitimize our playstyle in his eyes.<br/><br/>And, in Hillfolk specifically, it's also a surrender-distribution mechanism that's very interesting. The status tables will turn.<br/><br/>Many years ago, <a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> wrote a very compelling argument against these mechanics, using a metaphor from dog training that made these rewards almost feel gross. He influenced many designers and games. Me too, for a while. However, I'm glad to see these mechanics get a new chance. This comes back to the idea of subtractive vs additive models for portraying a character less capable than your ideal story-version of yourself. Sure, you <i>could</i> wrap yourself in will-saves and subject yourself to persuasion rolls. Or, you could <b>decide</b> to give in, and in those designs, keeping track of 'surrenders' via a marker is interesting design space.

The very absolutely worst that can happen because you roleplay your character well (that is, follow your cues) is that the character gets in trouble, as planned by the GM, and then gets out of trouble, as planned by the GM. This is a desirable course of events, so you're actually rewarded twice when you follow your cues: you get a Fate point, <i>and</i> you get to actually participate in an adventure story.<br/><br/>To clarify the point, consider the hypothetical character who turtles successfully by refusing to bite on any compels. The GM "rewards" them by letting them not participate in the story, because they apparently do not have a motivation to engage with it. Maybe the player decides to go along after all so he has something to do in the game session, except now he doesn't get the Fate point for it. Mission successful? Not so, because the point of playing Fate is to fight those poachers.<br/><br/>Translating the same mechanic to even slightly challenge-full D&amp;D will indeed come face to face with the fact that a hero point here or there is no match for actually making smart choices. In certain sorts of D&amp;D this matters, as you're not expected to character act so much as play the right moves so your character doesn't get killed. This of course means that roleplaying bennies are probably not a smart thing to add to D&amp;D: precisely as you say, the game mechanic legitimizes a player's choice to drop the flashlight, but it doesn't actually do anything to protect the player from the consequences of that action. The overt reward mechanic should be supported by a game structure that does not entrap the player who trusts the game and does what it tells them to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475110/#Comment_475110" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-30T07:27:34+00:00" title="June 30, 2018  7:27AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fate also has the concession rule to mitigate serious losses.<br/><br/>However, Fate points are easily quantifiable as +2, reroll, invocation, or compel-other. Getting one Fate point (instead of having to pay one for a compel refuse, so a delta of two) for getting into a side-quest fight that costs you three Fate points (or equivalent, in terms of track stress and consequences) is not commensurate.<br/><br/>Yeah, it's an order of magnitude of difference compared to a super lethal game like Tomb of Annihilation.<br/><br/>And that's why (the lethal version of) D&amp;D makes a <i>better</i> example for this. The case that the reward isn't a commensurate compensation, much <i>less</i> than in Fate, is exactly what I'm talking about. It's <i>just</i> an affordance marker. It's a clicky button that communicates "yes, this is pushable", not that it promises ice cream and morphine for hitting it.<br/><br/>If you jump over the flagpole in Super Mario Bros, the game kinda glitches out. And the debate when we were girls was always "is that intended? Have you seen it?" etc.<br/><br/>If someone drops the flashlight, they get the affordance marker, signalling "hey, you did something that's OK to do". Allowed isn't the same as optimal. It's part of the UX, it's a working, installed, connected, intended button but you can use your own judgment on when to push it or not, depending on which gameplay experience you desire. Horrible choices and horrible failure is, as many story games show, sometimes compelling af. (Similar to my grief and tears over the BRD, having a game experience stick in your mind for a week is awesome!

The system doesn't directly reward an action because it's geared towards creating an entirely different experience, so we're going to bolt on this other thing to try and redirect those incoherent choices back into the primary CA somehow. "You're not <i>really</i> breaking with our calculated, challenge-based play if you're gambling that the benefit you get for dropping the flashlight might help you later."<br/><br/>At least with Fate, the whole point of the game (to me at least, I seem to have a hard time finding people who agree) is creating these kinds of memorable character-cliches built around their aspects and a story arc that builds to a climax that the fate points help you overcome. It's a productive cycle there.<br/><br/>I don't really think that that's the point of inspiration in 5E, to be the primary driving force of the game, but I likewise have never really desired that sort of play from D&amp;D, so I may just not be able to look past my own blinders. It could explain why I don't particularly care for the edition, I suppose, but I've seen enough people talk about playing satisfying games without Insp that I don't think the game hinges on it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475122">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb" title="hamnacb"><img alt="hamnacb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hamnacb">hamnacb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475122/#Comment_475122" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-30T13:23:50+00:00" title="June 30, 2018  1:23PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Fate points are easily quantifiable as +2, reroll, invocation, or compel-other.

Handing them out, similarly, gives us a way to acknowledge what other players are doing. ("Yes, I recognize what you did there.")<br/><br/>However, I also agree that, in D&amp;D5, the way Inspiration works blurs some lines in uncomfortable ways. The whole "I was afraid of the spiders, so I dropped the flashlight, which led to the whole party dying" situation.... is rife for problems and needs some discussion for it to work without a hitch. The game doesn't really help you handle that at all, without bringing in skills and techniques and attitudes from other games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475135">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475135/#Comment_475135" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-01T04:55:42+00:00" title="July  1, 2018  4:55AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, great post.<br/><br/>Acknowledging that there can be in-game legal actions that will still lead to group problems but (like hamnacb) getting the point that affordance markers <i>are not meant to be commensurate</i>.

A friend of mine, his PC was a hobbit rogue named Joanne that had\u2026 some flaws that caused her to often act poorly and get insp. And he's a reader of Eero's posts. So I was talking to him, asking him "what's your take on the whole challenge game thing? About wanting to win?". This was maybe almost four years ago. Feb 2015 or fall 2014 (one of those two cons). And he answered, without a second of hesitation: "I want to win <i>as Joanne</i>".<br/><br/>If your character legitimately <i>is</i> a Taschenlampenfallerlasser, then figuring out a way for <i>that PC</i> to 'win', in spite of their cowardice, is part of the game. This isn't for everyone; Gygax said "If I want to do that, I'll join an amateur theater group".<br/><br/>I've told you before about the player in a Fate game that bought off every compel, leaving him dry of fate points. Years later I realized that he had put those aspects on there because he wanted to play the story of a character <i>overcoming</i> addiction, not succumbing to it. Of course.<br/><br/>So I'm happy that affordance markers support <i>voluntarily</i> giving in. (Unlike "will saving".) It's up to you to determine how to be "true to Joanne" -- and to what degree you want to try to be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475137">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johann" title="Johann"><img alt="Johann" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johann">Johann</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475137/#Comment_475137" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-01T06:21:50+00:00" title="July  1, 2018  6:21AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And he answered, without a second of hesitation: "I want to win <i>as Joanne</i>".</p></div></blockquote>\nI can relate to that!<br/><br/>I retrospect, I think I failed to look for context.

While they can point out that "X is a thing you can do", an affordance marker, by itself, does not answer the question "Why would I want to do that?" which is likely to be the actual problem - people who want to do that thing already will probably try to do that thing without needing a blinking arrow in the form of an affordance marker, and people who don't already want to do the thing will look at the marker, judge it suboptimal/a bad play/not worth the reward and still not do it.<br/><br/>So unless what you are dealing with is a group of players who don't realize what it is they want to do (Which does exist, but isn't by any means typical) the affordance markers don't really do anything.<br/><br/>Also this...\n<blockquote>As DM, I don't feel any agenda clash or coherence problems with flashlight dropping.

The DM probably isn't going to be the one who gets upset when someone drops the flashlight and the party gets eaten.  Heck, a lot of GMs with no interest in flashlight dropping as its own thing would still be pleased to get a chance to eat some/all the PCs.  At worst, the GM is likely to look at the players and go, "Uh, what the heck, folks, why did you do that?" It's the other players who are going to be angry because someone has decided to play with a different creative agenda and has just killed their five session old level 3 character because they wanted to roleplay a moment of panic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475261/#Comment_475261" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-08T20:45:43+00:00" title="July  8, 2018  8:45PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Airk, great point about the DM\u2019s love for flashlight dropping doesn\u2019t rule out any agenda clashes / coherence problems between <i>the players</i>.

If I can give someone the shortcut-to-awesomeness I wish I had\u2026</p><p>As for your first point; affordance markers don\u2019t answer why. That\u2019s the point of the thread, to discuss how they\u2019re different from more substantial rewards or compensation. 5e\u2019s insp isn\u2019t the only affordance marker. GURPS quirks are another. A measly five points? But it allows you to get silly [or to get serious, which can be just as an exposed position] with your character.</p><p>Affordance markers are a good tool. Most good games have some affordance markers. Fiasco: getting a black die affords surrendering/failing, and getting a white dice affords succeeding. Sorcerer: the way you are encouraged to describe your stats and not just leave them at numbers.</p><p>Sometimes the affordance marker is integral to the design, a tight chekhov-gun clockwork like Fiasco. And sometimes it\u2019s just\u2026 nice. Like flaubert\u2019s soap. It tells you something about where you are and why you\u2019re doing it. It makes you play differently or\u2026 <i>allows</i> you to play differently.</p><p>I think there are some different reactions to this thread, this idea.</p><p>One is if you already are familiar with them and you\u2019re like \u201cwhat is she trying to tell me?\u201d, and you can\u2019t find it, because I\u2019m not saying anything <em>new</em>.</p><p>Another if you keep getting them confused with substancial/commensurate rewards. They\u2019re not. I don\u2019t think Airk falls into this category because the big blinking arrow seems to me that they do see it as separate from rewards/compensation. They\u2019re not necessarily \u201c<strong>do</strong> this\u201d, though, unlike a blinking arrow. They\u2019re just \u201cyou\u2019re still within charted territory\u201d. A game that would\u2019ve been improved by affordance markers is original 2008 version of Stone Age. In that game, you can deliberately refrain from feeding your family and letting them starve, taking a punishment in the form of negative victory points. And the intent of the design was that that strategy were balanced with other strategies \u2013 counterable by some strategies, and a counter to some. The victory point hit was set to roughly match what you\u2019d gain in not having to get food. However, when that strategy started winning (at a rate intended by the designer, i.e. not a dominating strategy by any means), people thought it was a bug in the game. Nothing in the game made it look like \u201cyes, this is allowed\u201d. The reaction was rather \u201cwtf, this can\u2019t be right?!\u201d It was a bit of an easter egg but\u2026 the best easter eggs make you aware that you didn\u2019t just break the game, you <em>found</em> a new way to play. The game winks at you.</p><p>Upthread, I used this metaphor: \u201cYep\u2026 this button is also connected\u201d. Not necessarily a flashy or indicated or guided-to button, but\u2026 a <em>working</em> button.</p><p>A third is if you hate the examples. It becomes a bit of a chicken-egg problem, I\u2019ve used affordance markers in the past to argue for insp, and insp now to argue for affordance markers. And that\u2019s on me, I need more examples. 5e is just my favorite game though.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475262/#Comment_475262" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-08T22:28:31+00:00" title="July  8, 2018 10:28PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Partly I was a little sour that the old GNS / Big Model ghosts reared their heads once more.</p></div></blockquote>\nI'm sorry, it wasn't my intent to invoke the vengeful spirit of Ron Edwards; I was only using the term creative agenda as an easy shorthand (even your RISS has theoretical mutually exclusive combinations, IIRC), I guess I should have been more careful. <br/><br/>Discord over "But it's what my character would do!" long predates the Big Model, though, particularly in the historical corpus of "things going wrong in D&amp;D games" (and at least in some theoretical paradigms, as a result of the illusion that the game can simultaneously satisfy multiple and conflicting creative impulses).

Most people will instead just react with "I don't understand why I would want to do that."  To be fair, this is me carrying experiences from other game mediums into the RPG space here -- because I've been immersed in this hobby for so long that even when I play with new players, I don't see many/any "oh! I didn't realize I could do that in this game!" moments, so I'm more or less forced to extrapolate.  (The closest I've ever come is a game with relatively shared authorship that it took people used to more traditional GM'd games a while to grasp.)<br/><br/>This leads me to believe that the biggest value of affordance markers is for people who either are almost completely ignorant of RPGs, having not even heard friends talk about them or watched them on Youtube or whatever -- though I'm not sure how many of these people find their way into RPGs in the first place, and I expect the number who find their way to RPGs without being invited by someone else is even smaller.(1) Or for people who are trying out an entirely new "style" of game (e.g. moving from "Modern D&amp;D to OSR" or "Modern D&amp;D to Storygames"), once again, without really having read anything much about it. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>They\u2019re not necessarily \u201c<strong>do</strong> this\u201d, though, unlike a blinking arrow. They\u2019re just \u201cyou\u2019re still within charted territory\u201d.</p></div></blockquote>\nI think what I'm driving at is that in most cases, if you want a game to include a certain behavior, you're better off with a stronger incentive that providers a "why" even/especially if it's not a "why" you'd want all the time.  I'm hard pressed to think of places where this wouldn't be an improvement.  Though note that a "why" is context dependent.  If you're walking down the street, and someone tells you, "Hey! Did you know it's possible to give yourself an injection?"  the standard reaction would be "Uh....great, but why would I want to do that?"  But if you're deathly ill, and your doctor tells you "You can inject yourself with this once a day, and you should pull through" now there is a "why".  Reversely, and possibly more relevantly, if the cost of an action is low, it doesn't need to be a big "why" for people to do it, but if the cost is higher, you're back to "Why would I do that?"<br/><br/>For example, your GURPS quirks example has a "why" which makes it stronger than an affordance marker.  An affordance marker in this case would be more like "write down five quirks about your character".   Since GURPS also gives you character points for them, there is a pretty strong "why" here because the cost of doing this is zero.  This is even better than "commensurate reward" because it is essentially getting something for nothing. <br/><br/>Inspiration is arguably a weaker reward than those 5 character points, and many of the situations in which it could be granted are not "freebies" so classifying it as an affordance marker seems accurate.<br/><br/>(1) I also think that in general, the social pressure/support from other players will far outweigh the value of affordance markers, especially with newer players, but that this is not necessarily true with more powerful rewards.   A new player in a group that Does Not RP who gets weird looks and an "Okay, moving right along" when they play their trait for the first time is unlikely to repeat it for inspiration, especially since now they've GOT inspiration for the time being and it doesn't stack, but on the flipside, a new player surrounded by a bunch of people talking in funny accents and doing all kinds of RP things probably doesn't need an affordance to start Thee-ing and Thou-ing.  Meanwhile, a player in a Fate (or, haha, Tenra Bansho Zero) game, on the other hand, is unlikely to ever receive those funny looks, because A: The game doesn't have the underlying pushback that D&amp;D does by making the game about Getting XP and Levelling Up and B: C'mon, Fate Point (Or Aiki! Aiki!) -- the game is practically ABOUT getting these things.<br/><br/>So I think I agree with you that Inspiration points out that "hey, you can play these things" but I think it provides insufficient reward to counter the pushback from all the other mechanisms in the game.  In all seriousness, if someone dropped the torch and ran because their character was Afraid Of Spiders and my character died as a result, I would, at the very least, have to sit down with them afterwards and say "Maybe we shouldn't be playing D&amp;D, because I'm not interested in starting over from scratch because of your Roleplaying Moments."<br/><br/>tldr; Giving someone an affordance flag when the whole rest of the game says "This is probably a terrible idea" isn't going to do much to influence play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475273/#Comment_475273" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-09T18:00:21+00:00" title="July  9, 2018  6:00PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>only people who\u2019ve either been \u201ctaught wrong\u201d (i.e.\xa0people whose first experience was with a group that Did Not RP) or people who are 100% clueless about how these games work</p></div></blockquote><p>I wish I could reach them <img alt=":bawling:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/bawling.png" title=":bawling:"/></p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>This is clarifying, though I suspect that there aren\u2019t too many people in the same position as 1992 you floating around this forum.</p></div></blockquote><p>Yeah\u2026 there might be more over on TPB but\u2026 I can\u2019t handle that place anymore.<br/>I guess I prefer smaller communities<br/>My hope is that my writing here will trickle out to those who can be influenced by it</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>It doesn\u2019t bother me inherently, it\u2019s just that the posts always seem to praise the thing when viewed through an extremely specific lens, yet present this a sort of universal truth that everyone should like the thing.</p></div></blockquote><p>That\u2019s part of the writing schtick; to counter-act the old RGFA posts I grew up with saying that \u201cD&amp;D is absolute rubbish because X, Y and Z\u201d, I now write \u201cX, Y and Z is absolutely awesome\u201d.

My home game uses insp when they are really really afraid. Death saves, navigation rolls after being lost for a while, disease saves, very dangerous attacks\u2026 The con group used insp all the time in order to free it up to get new soon.

He is a treasure to our group.</p><p>We have plenty of selfish and cowardly PCs at our table.

That\u2019s another affordance marker btw.

That's the point. Dropping the flashlight isn't <b><i>about</i></b> "do I get that insp that I really desperately truly need, or do I hold on to the flashlight?". It's about just saying "hey, in this game, being fearful, being incompetent\u2026 is allowed.

To me that's interesting. Do they take the opportunity to play weak? Fearful? Obsessed? Orderly? Lawful? Do they leave it, in favor of competence? <b>It's not because of the reward,</b> that's for sure.<br/><br/>It's because they want to. They drop the flashlight because they want to drop the flashlight. They portray fear because they want to portray fear. The game allows them, but doesn't trick them or bribe them or encourage them.

But sadly, I don't think your experience was that atypical.  90s RPG writing was pretty awful.   Whether it's AD&amp;D2 selling itself as a game of heroic adventure when it was still basically an Oldschool deathtrap, or Vampire The Masquerade and all its "okay Mr. GM, you come up with a Chronicle, and it's your job to make sure the PCs stay on track" advice.<br/><br/>I think I've discovered some crossed wires here though.  Most of your posts don't feel like they are "aimed at the GM" particularly.   They don't feel like advice on or even particularly encouraging of location-based play.  They seem to focus on a lot of peripheral stuff that is PART of location based play but not necessarily tied to it -- for example, this whole discussion of affordance markers and inspiration isn't really tied to Location Based Play at all.  It's like giving someone advice on how to drive by teaching them how to use a radio or something.  Yes, there's a radio, and yes, it can improve your experience, but it's neither core to nor unique to driving.  <br/><br/>So I need to step back and view your writing more from a GM perspective rather than a player/playstyle perspective, and you may need to make sure you are tying your stuff back to your "core thesis" if you want your love for Location Based Play to inform your writing. (Or rather, to inform us irregular readers who can't keep it in mind when reading your writing.)\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>What I was going for was that the affordance marker part of the action was \u201cwrite down five quirks and get five points\u201d and the conveyed part of the action was \u201cplay out your quirks\u201d, which is does have a social cost and sometimes a diegetic cost if it affects reaction rolls etc.<br/></p></div></blockquote>\nI don't remember the rules calling out any actual obligation to play out your quirks once you've written them down, but it's been a Really Long Time since I played GURPS because my experience with it was heavily negative.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>Hopefully the non-RP-ing players would see that the RP-ing player got \u201crewarded\u201d with the useless ribbon that insp is and thus back off.

Imagine if D&amp;D said "At the end of any session where you played any three of your Trait/Ideal/Bond/Flaw, you gain enough XP to reach the start of your next level."  No one (Pretty much, anyway) would ever look at someone funny for playing a trait under those circumstances, because everyone knows that getting levels is a large part of what the game is about, so what you are doing is clearly "playing the game right". Inspiration has low impact and is non-stacking, so the circumstances in which it feels "acceptable" to try to earn it are limited.<br/><br/>I recognize that at this point, it just becomes "my table experience vs yours" -- somehow, Inspiration has worked wonders at your table.  At mine, it might as well have not existed. We really TRIED to use it, but it was hard to remember, ineffective when used (My "fondest" memory is from Lost Mines of Phandelver where my dwarven cleric finally found his missing family member in the clutches of the orc(?) chief, yelled his battle cry, cast his one offensive spell, spend inspiration, and rolled a 4 and a 9. RIP inspiration.) and generally disappointing.<br/><br/>Though reading what you write now, I think I have a guess about what's going on.   Your first experience with this was with a con group.  It is SO, SO MUCH easier to commit to "living dangerously" at a con, because NO MATTER WHAT, you are not coming back to that character.  You don't have five sessions of scraping and struggling to reach level 3 and scribe that scroll/buy that full plate armor/whatever.  Your character has no history with you and has no future with you, so there's almost no reason NOT to go all-in on roleplaying for inspiration.   There's no expectation that you're all coming back next week to continue the campaign. You're not.  This is IT, so you might as well burn fast and bright. <br/><br/>Have you gotten this "singing inspiration" effect happening with your home group?  Humorously, as I was typing this, I finally figured out what the advantage of your house rule is -- namely, being told "You would've gotten inspiration for that" has the effect of making me think "Damnit, I should've spent it" and therefore theoretically encouraging people to use it.  Is this working for your home group? I had thought from your earlier posts that it was, but this one sortof didn't sound like it?<br/><br/>With regard to the whole "do you trust this person with the lantern" thing, I don't really want to play that game.  If my character had doubts about this person's ability to hold onto the lantern, I wouldn't be here in the dungeon with them, but we all signed up to play a game where we go to the dungeon.  I don't want to be the "F- no, I am not going to the dungeon with YOU" guy.   And even if I did, I'd certainly never do it AGAIN after they did, and that's just as bad as killing my character, frankly.  I'm glad you find it fun, but to me it's a horrible, horrible conflict between "behaving in a manner that makes sense for my character" (Never again going to a dungeon with Sir Lantern Dropper of Rothmont) and "playing the game in good faith" (Wherein we agree to play adventurers who go into a dungeon together.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475278/#Comment_475278" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-09T21:46:50+00:00" title="July  9, 2018  9:46PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Most of your posts don\u2019t feel like they are \u201caimed at the GM\u201d particularly.

Both elements are present, they're both valuable, and they're both allowed, but Fate sees the need and the virtue in encouraging more of the latter one.<br/><br/>If the payout were so obviously trivial as to be an ineffective bribe, serving merely as a formalized reminder of how the game wants you to play, I don't know if that balance would tilt.  To the extent that it <i>does</i> tilt because the payout <i>isn't</i> obviously trivial... well, I think we <i>are</i> talking about a bribe.<br/><br/>I agree with Rickard's oft-made points about extrinsic bribes being underwhelming, but I think there are two ameliorating circumstances here:<br/><br/>1) The player <i>does</i> assign <i>some</i> intrinsic value to character actions that cause trouble and drama.<br/><br/>2) Each use of the mechanic is an opportunity to make the reward of using the mechanic more intrinsic in future repetitions if the game delivers the <i>real</i> reward, which is <i>fun play</i>.  Fate doesn't want players to get their characters in trouble for no reason; it presumes that getting characters in trouble <i>helps the fun</i>.  <br/><br/>I would say that if a group really does <i>not</i> enjoy trouble of the characters' own making, then Fate Compels are purely extrinsic for them and they shouldn't use them (or they shouldn't play Fate).<br/><br/>On top of all this, I think the rule in the book regarding "opt into trouble" does <i>also</i> function as a signal that opting into trouble is legit and allowed.  But I think that's true of <i>all</i> game rules which invoke formal procedures, not just those which give you Points (risk-commensurate or otherwise).<br/><br/>If I write a rule that says, "When your character gets in trouble, roll on this table of cool environmental details and then pick a player to narrate the results into the fiction," I think it's pretty clear to everyone that getting your character in trouble is legit and allowed.  (On top of which, I like those intrinsic rewards of attention, interaction, and fictional color more than any Fate Point.  Take that, Fate!)<br/><br/>So I'd say that the examples in your opening post are each part affordance marker and part bribe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475281/#Comment_475281" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-09T22:10:12+00:00" title="July  9, 2018 10:10PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" rel="nofollow">David_Berg</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><ol><li><p>The player <i>does</i> assign <i>some</i> intrinsic value to character actions that cause trouble and drama.</p></li><li>Each use of the mechanic is an opportunity to make the reward of using the mechanic more intrinsic in future repetitions if the game delivers the <i>real</i> reward, which is <i>fun play</i>.

I guess I don't see the game -- or at least all campaigns -- as goal-directed, and not all dungeons to be mandatorily completed or cleared. In the con game where insp sang, the party briefly entered a dungeon, grabbed some resources, food and info, and then left for a nearby village. They left the largest part of the dungeon unexplored,and I never prompted them to explore it fully. The dungeon is a dangerous, living location. A backdrop, a mileu for play that is partially interparty. A part of the world, not an obstacle course with a goalpost at the end.<br/><br/>That's different for every campaign. But that's the sort of attitude that allows flashlight dropping.<br/><br/>Extrinsic: We meant <i>in</i>trinsic. But, to the degree that a reward is truly insintric is a matter of semantics. Whether or not a supposedly inherently joyful or pleasant activity truly is <i>inherently</i> so is contingent on to what extent you consider various sensations to be inherent parts of the activity, vs caused by externalities -- memory, connotation, pride, satisfaction all could carry or create baggage affecting this or future instanses of the activity.

I think you're getting hung up on the word "dungeon" here. Everything is a dungeon.  The deadly wilderness is a dungeon.  The Earl's dinner party is a dungeon.  What if I say it like this:<br/><br/>If I make a character who is going to go on adventures, and those adventures are dangerous, then my character is probably not going to want to go on said adventures with people who make the danger worse through their behavior.   But at the same time, we are playing a group game, and the expectation is that I won't say "To Hades with you, DropsTorchAlot! I'm going to go on adventures without you!" <br/><br/>So when DropsTorchALot has a freak out and drops the torch because SPIDERS! my character isn't going to say "Okaaay, well, DropsTorchALot is fine, as long as we keep them clear of spiders." they're going to say "What am I doing putting this person in a situation where they have my life in their hands?" <br/><br/>Or is your D&amp;D game not actually about going on adventures? Because it sounds like it is, and honestly I can't imagine D&amp;D being someone's favorite game for something other than going on adventures. That seems like pretty much what the game is for.  I understand that you like the party interactions, and so do I, but I also need to be able to reconcile them with the fact that the game is deadly, which means the world is deadly, which means my character isn't going to want to trust their life to someone who freaked out and ran away without warning.<br/><br/>Are you setting the world up in a way that these people's choices are "Adventure together or adventure with no one (aka "die")"?  A fictional solution is perfectly fine here most of the time, because what's killing me is the friction between the fictional reasoning and the out of game reasoning, so if you can change the fictional side of the equation, then it all balances out.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475290/#Comment_475290" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-10T06:20:32+00:00" title="July 10, 2018  6:20AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 10, 2018 6:21AM by 2097.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the Brutal Raptor Death situation some weeks ago\u2026 I gave one player a choice. There are twelve raptors approaching, how many of them do you engage with and how many do you let through to your friend?<br/>Thinking it'd be interesting. He had higher AC, and wasn't surprised. Was he going to take on seven? Eight? Proportionate to the AC. Or take on three? Increasing the chance that he'd survive, letting his friend take the hit.<br/>He chose to let all twelve raptors attack his friend. Who then died.<br/>Isn't that a little fucked up? Isn't that a bit of a flashlight drop?<br/>I don't know how those are going to live with that. How is his new char going to trust the old char, even? <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23bleed&amp;Mode=like">#bleed</a> This goes over to the player level, too.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that if everything's a dungeon, everything's a flashlight drop too. Someone playing suboptimally is someone endangering my PC. "Why did you roll for HP instead of taking the average? You know it's 5% worse to roll, right?" It's a matter of degree, sure. But that's hov I think. The cowardly PC is the BRD scenario doesn't have any cowardly diegetical traits such as "fearful", "selfish". He's supposed to be good aligned. He blamed his low HP but\u2026 that's a bed <i>he</i> made.<br/><br/><small>This is an area where the new TOR-derived monster selection rules have made the game less agential and interesting, compared to the 13A-like interception rules I was using in the BRD sitch.</small><br/><br/>If you're thinking it'd be frustrating playing D&amp;D with such a guy, I agree. But\u2026 <i>every</i> player is a slippery slope away from being him.\n<blockquote>Pulling together is the aim of despotism and tyranny.

It's clear to me and I think to everyone that decisions a character makes while under the effect of a cursed cloak or whatever are not the decisions that either the player or the character would want to make.  Their hand is forced.  This causes no issues for either the "my character doesn't trust you anymore" angle OR the "Why did you just screw me over OOCly?" angle.  So set that aside.<br/><br/>So to try to disconnect the two types of problems:<br/><br/>The first of these is that the social contract to play the game, as a group, requires the party to stay together, so other characters taking actions that would drive that apart ("My character doesn't trust you anymore.") create friction with it, because what my character wants is to NOT have to deal with these people who are clearly not trustworthy, and what _I_ want is to keep playing with my friends.  So friction between fiction elements and social contract.<br/><br/>The second of these is the "To me, D&amp;D is a bad game to experiment with trust and betrayal in, because the in game consequences of such things break the fundamental D&amp;D game engine of 'go on adventures, gain levels, go on cooler adventures'."   David's solution sortof helps with this one, because it shifts some of the "blame" onto the system, but the consequences are still there.  If I've spent six months playing a character every week and he gets killed because someone decided that now was the time to throw away the lantern, and I lose all that investment, I'm probably done with that game, because it's not going to be a lot of fun for me to start over with a new character at level 1 at that point.  This one is friction between game systems and social contract.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_475301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475301/#Comment_475301" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-10T19:00:42+00:00" title="July 10, 2018  7:00PM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Airk" rel="nofollow">Airk</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>If I\u2019ve spent six months playing a character every week and he gets killed because someone decided that now was the time to throw away the lantern, and I lose all that investment, I\u2019m probably done with that game, because it\u2019s not going to be a lot of fun for me to start over with a new character at level 1 at that point.</p></div></blockquote><p>Well, the reason the mind control example was there (and the NPC lantern dropper example) is because the danger to your PC is the same, and, the ways you\u2019d prepare for the danger is similar (or even a subset, since the \u201ctalk to them OOC\u201d solution isn\u2019t there).
