Since the characters are merchant-adventurers, it mostly focuses on how much crazy crap they can afford at different scales, but it also tied the trade into the gaming. Basically the group has a "profit" rating which is rolled like a skill. You modify the roll based on the scale of purchase (a personal weapon/enough weapons for an army and steps in between), quality of product, and rarity/availability. The GM provides "ventures" (adventure hooks) the successful completion of which adds to your profit (and messing certain stuff up subtracts). Unfortunately, it doesn't give any crunch to the wheelings and dealings, if that's what you're looking for, but it's a pretty straightforward way to integrate business into an otherwise adventure/mission focused game n                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296822">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296822/#Comment_296822" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T06:35:48+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  6:35AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great ideas all.

In the real world, this isn't really what is going on. More important than both of these is <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk" rel="nofollow">risk</a></i>. Most trading that happens, especially these days, is more properly viewed as the trading of risk. And there are all kinds of risk. The important question is not so much "will this trade be profitable?" but "will this trade be worth the risk?". A system based around answering that question would probably go a lot further than others I've seen.<br/><br/>One market that is almost purely about risk is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract" rel="nofollow">futures</a> market. Managing risk is the whole reason it exists. In this market, the "goods" that are being bought and sold are non-tangible. They are, in effect, <i>promises</i>. It's an entire market of tracking and trading nothing but obligation, yet if it didn't exist, the modern world would slow dramatically. The risk that it allows companies to manage would have to be managed in some other way, and that would likely require higher prices, lower production or both. I don't think a gaming system needs to deal with the futures market, necessarily, but if the system can be easily used to do so, it is on the right track.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_296832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296832/#Comment_296832" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T07:38:57+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  7:38AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Another thing about rules for markets: avoid the mistake of a lot of trading games (particularly computer games, like <a href="http://www.ambrosiasw.com/games/evn/" rel="nofollow">Escape Velocity</a>) where there are known "profitable routes" that people can use over and over to generate essentially infinite wealth. The problem with such systems isn't that profitable routes exist. They should (and, historically, did) exist. The problem is that traffic on these routes typically has no effect on the prices found on the route. Instead, the more a route gets used, the less profitable it should become over time.<br/><br/>This "degrading prices" solution also works to avoid things like the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php?topic=27582.0" rel="nofollow">Wall of Iron trick</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/akooser" title="akooser"><img alt="akooser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/392/nA03PVHI22NBX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/akooser">akooser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296842/#Comment_296842" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T08:20:16+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  8:20AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya Wordman,<br/><br/>  So what would this look like in an RPG system?

Have a mechanic that randomly, but within limit, changes the availability:price distribution of goods. This should mainly be used to establish the initial situation on the market. If I roll 3d6 for Grain and get Availability 3: Price 1 for that market, and my merchant buys a shitton of Grain, then the situation should become Availability 1: Price 3. This is still fairly predictable, so insert another degree of randomisation. (and possibly a degree of influences on the markets of the whole country) So, you can't buy Grain cheap forever.<br/>2. Use abstract measures of wealth, to avoid tracking individual coins and the impossible inflation that usually comes from such "systems" (ie. see the absurdities of the common D&amp;D market).<br/><br/>Freemarket might also hold something for you. It's a post-scarcity society, but I think certain things about Flow and stuff could be reskinned to model a more traditional economy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_296855">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/296855/#Comment_296855" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-10-14T09:49:19+00:00" title="October 14, 2010  9:49AM">October 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2011 9:31AM by DanielSolis.">edited January 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>Someone smart on Story Games proposed a thing where you roll a number of d6 depending on the size of the market, say, 4-8 or so.
