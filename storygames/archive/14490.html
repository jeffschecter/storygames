I was sick and not really able to talk, I had a bit part.<br/><br/>Teaching the game<br/>Super easy, we just passed the book around and took turns reading it picture book style. Then I put the character cards out and everyone picked one. <br/><br/>Introductions<br/>The game tells you to stand up and introduce yourself. So thats what we did.<br/><br/>Momoko: Hi, I..I'm Momoko, and ..I just want people to like me.<br/>Risa: Hi, I'm Risa, the class president and I'd love to show you around the school!<br/>Takamichi: Hello, I'm Takamichi, and there's a 98.7333 repeating percent chance that I'm the smartest boy in the school!<br/>Ichigo: (looking sullen) ... Hi ... this is stupid.<br/><br/>Then you ask Momoko out on a date... again you stand up when you do this.<br/>Ichigo: (looking sullen) ... Hey ... <br/>Momoko: Oh Hi!<br/>Ichigo: ... I've seen you around.... I'm Ichigo.<br/>Momoko: Oh, h...hi Ichigo, I'm Momoko.<br/><br/>so much fun.<br/><br/>The dates were great, Momoko went to get noodles, to the arcade, rode on the subway, went on a tandem bike ride to the zoo, and got attacked by a monkey. <br/><br/>One thing not in the book that really pulled it together for me was to keep weaving elements from the dates back into the story. We had a couple reoccurring characters. <br/><br/>Harry played Momoko's jealous friend who worked at the noodle shop (where he "accidentally" dosed Risa with some extra spice!), later he showed up as a janitor at the zoo "Oh Hi Momoko, yeah this is my other job" where he snuck  Momoko and Takamichi in past the crowded lines. <br/><br/>I played Sato Sensei, their math teacher, who kept showing up once on each date. It was a nice opportunity to contrast the protagonists through their different relationships w/ Sato Sensei. It was also a good opportunity for me to bust out my high school level japanese.<br/><br/>Personally, I would pull the challenge mechanics from the game. I had a great time, but I was done when we figured out who had the most hearts. I don't think a player should be able to mechanically force a replay the entire game. <br/><br/>Also I love standing up, don't skip this part. It really help people get into the game.<br/>sweet times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care" title="Emily_Care"><img alt="Emily_Care" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/967/n3JC7BBWHMD0R.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Emily_Care">Emily_Care</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329945/#Comment_329945" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T10:59:06+00:00" title="June 15, 2011 10:59AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2011 10:59AM by Emily_Care.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds lovely!

Dammit, I played with the <i>designer</i>, and he didn't tell us to do this! I feel robbed. Richmoooond!!!<br/><br/>So yeah, I played a game. It was lots of fun. We were:<br/><br/>Momoko: Me!<br/><br/>Suitors:<br/>Ichigo: Tracy<br/>Takemichi: Jake<br/>Risa: Ben<br/><br/>We played the dates in that order. <b>Ichigo </b>took me to the treehouse that was his only childhood refuge, then a tart shop where he's a regular, then to this pool hall that lets him in even though he's a minor. Tracy played Ichigo all sullen and aloof, so while he made some gains in occasional displays of tenderness, like sharing his wistful sentiments of childhood, or defending my honor from gangbangers, the way he flinched away and blew it off as no big deal meant not too many cards. In the end (for each date, the other players offer Momoko an embarrassing choice in exchange for increased affection), I just couldn't bear to stand by Ichigo and see him get hurt by the sexually harassing gang, so he sent me home by myself on his moped while he faced off with them.<br/><br/><b>Takemichi</b> took me to the zoo, then a picnic in the park, then a karaoke parlor. Jake played Takemichi as a nerdy, oblivious goof, for instance continuing to text me after we'd found each other at the train station (last text: "And now I'm greeting you."). He was so awkward, and the zoo trip so disastrous, that I was feeling like he wouldn't be the one, but at karaoke we both loosened up a little (complete with alcoholic drinks mistakenly sent to our room), and he ended up being quite endearing. I DID assent to the embarrassment of passing out drunk in the room and letting Takemichi see me onto a cab home. Good times!<br/><br/><b>Risa </b>took me to all the main hangouts of the neighborhood, since I'd just transferred schools, culminating in the Cherry Blossom Festival fair. Ben played Risa all pert and businesslike with passion smoldering unspoken underneath, all under the plausible-deniability cover of "As class president it's my duty to show the new student around town!" I found the whole date really fun and sweet, and Risa very likeable and relaxing to be around. the end of the evening watching fireworks in solitude on a hilltop was so enthralling. However I just couldn't bring myself to accept a kiss from Risa--my shyness and the weight of taboo was too great! So in the end the affection was only so-so.<br/><br/>And so it turned out that Takemichi was the one for me, with the highest affection total! Of course, Risa and Ichigo didn't take this lying down, forming an unlikely alliance to sully Take-kun with a nasty rumor! But My faith in Takemichi gave me the understanding to love him in spite of his terrible secret, and now we're going steady!<br/><br/><br/><br/>A couple of techniques we used:<br/><br/>We did have recurring characters though all the scenes. the family that runs the tart shop treats Ichigo as an honorary son, and they were all obtrusively encouraging of our romantic date the whole time we were in there. Then Ichigo's surrogate big-sister showed up on the other dates, appearing to subtly sabotage Takemichi, and just providing friendly banter for me and Risa. It was a fun bit of continuity and an added twist to the hijinks.<br/><br/>The other thing we did was, tie the three dates together through the "ask Momoko out" scenes, so that there was some continuity, and in the process we highlighted the potentially problematic nature of going on three dates one after the other with different people. So for instance, Takemichi asked Momoko out while she was waiting outside school to give Ichigo back his moped. When Take turned to leave, Momoko saw Ichigo, battered from his gang fight, standing there watching the proceedings, and giving her a glare of bitter understanding. It heightened the drama just ever so slightly, so that the feelings of these teenagers felt really <i>at stake</i>, without making it all weepy.<br/><br/>Great game. I'd play it again! Next time, I wanna be a suitor!<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330128/#Comment_330128" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T20:00:28+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  8:00PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i saw Jole's game while it was being played, looked like the group was having a good time. glad to finally know the details.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330150/#Comment_330150" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-16T00:25:49+00:00" title="June 16, 2011 12:25AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really glad you guys have enjoyed the game.
