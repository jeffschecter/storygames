Andy Kitkowski thought this was cool and that we should have a forum that was like that all the time. Around roughly the same time, certain indie games such as My Life With Master were getting some flack for not being "real RPGs" (whatever that means), so Clinton R. Nixons suggested that we call all vaguely RPG-inspired games "story games" as a way of being more inclusive and rejecting a narrow definition of what roleplaying was. These two streams came together when Andy created Story-Games.com as a place to talk about all sorts of games, from D&amp;D to jeepform. Over time, lots of people have starting using the term "story games" to refer to all sorts of things, not all of which overlap exactly. Sometimes it's code for "indie games," or "strange indie games," or "GM-less RPGs," or "RPGs that require more creative input from their players," or "cooperative RPGs," or something like that. Sometimes people still use it in Clinton's sense of "a broader category of narrative games that includes traditional RPGs but also other things" but I think that's more and more rare these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404665/#Comment_404665" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T10:45:28+00:00" title="January 26, 2013 10:45AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, to build on what JDCorley said, even if you agree that there's some sort of clear distinction between mainstream roleplaying and weird indie games (and I'm not sure there really is), there's always been a lot of strange ducks out their in RPGland and many of them were directly inspirational to the recent post-2000 indie-RPG movement led by the Forge. Folks like Greg Costikyan, Greg Stolze, Robin Laws, Kenneth Hite, Steffan O'Sullivan, John Tynes, Jonathan Tweet, Greg Stafford, James Wallis, John Wick, and Eric Wujcik were the intellectual ancestors of what came later. So I think any history has to start with them.<br/><br/>In the presentation on the history of indie RPGs that I made with Jackson last year at Gamestorm, I argued that indie games came from:<br/><br/>1. Dissatisfaction with existing RPG publishing options<br/>2. Dissatisfaction with late-1980s and 1990s RPG writing/design (specifically freelancing as a model of production)<br/>3. Our Intellectual Ancestors (mentioned above)<br/>4. The Internet (which made everything else possible)<br/><br/>But for it to really come together, that involved a specific group of people: Ron Edwards, Clinton R. Nixon, Mike Holmes, Emily Care Boss,  Luke Crane, Jared Sorensen, Paul Czege, Vincent Baker, Ben Lehman, Tim Kleinart, etc. actually building a community around possible new methods of doing things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404670">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404670/#Comment_404670" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T11:38:47+00:00" title="January 26, 2013 11:38AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, are you talking about the website? <a href="http://gfbrobot.com/2012/06/05/games-community-andy-k-on-story-games-com/" rel="nofollow">Andy can tell you</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404679/#Comment_404679" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T13:27:05+00:00" title="January 26, 2013  1:27PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2013 1:30PM by Graham.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan's got it.

Is this because you all have lost your faith in actual experiences you lived through, or are all the people here at the forum so fresh that they didn't live through the formative years in the early 2000s? Perplexing. I remember Jonathan from the Forge, at least. Or maybe it's just come into fashion to humour people like JD, who like to pretend that other people's histories are somehow not real.<br/><br/>And yes, all terms are arbitrary and so on, blah blah. Assuming a constructive reading, I'm still pretty sure that we are capable of transmitting models of cultural history from within one person's brain into anothers. Just takes some care and good-will from both parties.<br/><br/>So, the real history in a very high birds-eye perspective follows. "Real" in the sense that what I'm going to say should pretty much accord with how many people experienced these events personally. The following is not "real" in the sense Jason always insists on, as some sort of universal claim that would hold for him as well even if he never experienced any of this. Basically, as is often the case with history, you should not read the following with an implicit universal quantor in front of each sentence; rather, take it as one of the many things that were happening through these years, a single trend that has great explanatory power for the world we find ourselves in today. If somebody disagrees and tells you that they got into story games in 2010 and never mind the Forge and anyway they'd been playing the exact same kind of games since 1982, well, perhaps they're not the best reporter on the cultural history of the phenomenon.<br/><br/><b>The late '90s</b> found the rpg culture in an established apex of what might be termed the <b>traditional school</b> of roleplaying: the kind of roleplaying that strived for all sorts of artistic expression and ambitious genre work, all without thoroughly revising the basics that had developed during the first decade of rpg history (I'm counting the beginning of the era from -74 or so). Many people, myself included, had come into the hobby around the beginning of the '90s, and there were many of us who had been very thoroughly immersed in the traditional school: we believed that roleplaying was about GM artistry, deep game worlds, thorough emulation of source literature, expensive commercial gaming brands, and the other things you know from that era.<br/><br/>In hindsight we can say that the traditional school of roleplaying culture had <b>some problems</b>. Some of these are as follows: game texts that rely on existing expertise instead of game design; dishonest creative set-ups that attempt to entertain everybody's disparate interests all at once; failure to recognize and verbalize that different creative agendas exist within the rpg scene; huge buy-in for the commercial myth, including things like the supplement treadmill. Some people were more affected than others; many seem to deny that any problems exist, perhaps because these things are not problems for them.<br/><br/>In the <b>early '00s</b> various counter-movements in rpg culture gained in strength, as more people grew disillusioned with the kind of roleplaying that was being offered within the tradition. The one that grew fastest and strongest at the time was the <b>indie trend</b>. As often happens in different cultural fields, the term "indie", while technically meaning independent publishing, came to imply a specific kind of aesthetic and creative goals in roleplaying. This meaning was provided by the spearheading cadre of the indie movement, <b>the Forge</b>. (You can and should read more about the Forge if you want to understand Story Games, I should say.)<br/><br/>As Andy describes here and there, he basically started Story Games the forum as a place for Forge-heads and like-minded people to interact in a less work-like environment - the Forge never was an uncomplicated place for just chatting about games. The specific term "story game" was adopted as an experiment in terminology; its meaning has been ranging all over the place, just like "roleplaying", but for the most part people seem to use it to either mean "a game designed by the structuralist precepts of the Forge", or "a game that is particularly about stories, particularly storytelling". Often it's easiest to just understand "story game" as a local synonym for "roleplaying game", in many communication situations that's much more constructive than trying to pretend that they are different things.<br/><br/>All that in a nutshell: Story Games is a forum that was started by Andy because he was inspired by the Forgean indie rpg scene, which in turn was all about reforming roleplaying and fixing problems that the participants saw in traditional roleplaying. Since SG was started, I don't think that the forum has had any birds-eye history worth a mention, really: it's just been trucking along happily. Perhaps it's worthwhile to mention that SG has been much more popular than the Forge was: this is a more welcoming place, and over the years it's attracted many people without the Forge background that was the practical default early on. It would be entirely fair to say that SG has been in the process of evolving into more than a continuation of the Forge; I'm specifically thinking of a few prominent Nordic-style posters who've had a lot of influence here in rounding out the local modes of thought.<br/><br/>Now, was that so hard? More specifically, does somebody actually disagree with this simple outline of where Story Games comes from? Of course a specific history of games (instead of the forum) would probably get more argumentative, but that maybe was not quite what was asked, or was it?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404697/#Comment_404697" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T16:41:41+00:00" title="January 26, 2013  4:41PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2013 4:48PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't pretend other people's histories don't exist!

I mean, you, Jason, have been arguing for years that a specific traditional style of roleplaying does not exist, and a recognizable Forgean subculture does not either, all apparently because you yourself lack the personal history to appreciate these differences. I've yet to hear an explanation for how and why these cultural phenomena like say a Story Games forum exists. Apparently it's either a collective insanity where people imagine that they're a community based on specific gaming styles when they're "really" not (quotes because I don't personally understand how subjective impression of gaming style could be wrong - it's an aesthetic matter, it exists if a person says it does!), or it's a random process - web forums occur spontaneously and people congregate there, all without there actually being an ideological historical current drawing them together.<br/><br/>Would you also say that impressionism does not exist? I mean the stylistical trend in the visual arts. I mean, it seems to exist about as much or as little as a separate Forgean subculture of roleplaying does: for example, we could say that because there have been similar ideas earlier in art history, that proves that impressionism was not anything new, and therefore it does not exist. Or we could say that because similar things have been done by people with no overt connection, it's not a recognizable single style. Or we could say that because it's possible to create works that are only weakly impressionistic, it's not a style. Does that convince you in art history? If it does, then I suppose you just don't believe in explaining cultural history via named currents of thought at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404702/#Comment_404702" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-26T17:05:48+00:00" title="January 26, 2013  5:05PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started gaming around 79-80, bailed in the nineties because I didn't find any if the mainstream games interesting, missed the forge and everything until about 6 years ago when I went to a convention on a lark and discovered Dogs in the Vineyard and Fate.

Like, in the very paragraph where you talk about it, you even say "different creative agendas exist(ed) within the rpg scene" (though you apparently didn't notice the texts of the day ot only admitted that this was true but put it front in center in discussions of what actual play was supposed to be like), and that it already encompassed essentially everything in "Forgean subculture" (just using your own definition of what it was concerned with above) up to <i>and including</i> insulting competitive playstyles! \n<blockquote> I've yet to hear an explanation for how and why these cultural phenomena like say a Story Games forum exists.

There's a huge factor of luck in what makes a "successful" forum versus one that isn't successful.  There's a shitload of post-Forge sites that didn't make it.  But it's possible there is an ideology and I'm (one of) the outlier(s). Maybe that's what all that GNS argument every year is about!\n<blockquote>Would you also say that impressionism does not exist?

If you made me use it, I would say that roleplaying games would be "the visual arts", impressionism might map to "games with die pools" or "games with Keys" or "games with exit points for characters other than death or campaign collapse" or "games where a GM pursues a theme, in the 8th grade English sense" or "games where play expresses a moral premise  in the Lajos Egri sense of 'premise'". It's just a type of regular old (only 40 years) boring (exciting!) normal roleplaying games.  <br/><br/>There can of course be new developments - almost all new games bring them! - but it's already hugely encompassing and has always been thoroughly chock-full of healthy variety.

Believing even for a split second that there is a "subculture" in gaming that can be identified as containing play of Universalis, Don't Rest Your Head, and Capes but excluding a great deal of play of GURPS, Vampire and Cartoon Action Hour, seems unbelievably crazy in every possible way.<br/><br/>Now if you're saying there are "Forgean endeavours" like new approaches to game production, distribution and sales, I know nothing of business, I am a pure being of spiritual energy unsullied by such matters, so I will have to acknowledge my lack of insight there. So if what you're really talking about is a subculture of business-people and creators (as opposed to a subculture of <i>play</i>), you may very well be right. \n<blockquote>Also, continuing in that vein, I do not understand how somebody would find it credible to interpret that Story Games was formed and shaped into what it became over the last few years accidentally, without having a strong unifying backbone in the form of a Forgean gaming ideology.

How is it not just a kind of Abrahamic religion that some crazy people arbitrarily distinguish from Judaism?

(Goes without saying that if you don't believe in the paradigm shift, then you don't need to believe in story games, either.) The kind of roleplaying games we mostly knew before then were textually ambivalent, GM-dominated and commercial in concern. The kind of games that came out of the fulcrum were independently published, analytically designed (that is, the game designer doubted everything and redescribed the process of roleplaying from the ground up for his purposes) and focused on their topic and creative agenda. A historically dominant focus due to the specific interests of the people at the Forge was in narrativism or Story Now, a specific creative agenda; when we talk of "story games", we are often talking about specifically narrativist games.<br/><br/>(Other people like to emphasize different things in the history of story games, and they're rarely entirely wrong. For example, a series of experimental story games were published in the late '90s by Hogshead Publishing, including such as <i>Baron von Munchausen</i>, <i>De Profundis</i>, <i>Pantheon</i> - was that Hogshead? - and <i>Puppetland</i>, so some people trace the substantial beginnings of this subculture there. I don't, because I don't see a continuous practice, a publishing history of logical influence, nor self-identification of a peer group revolving around this era of games. All of the above are of course important influences, but they are not the core cultural trend we're perceiving when we look at story games today.)<br/><br/>As has been discussed before, we can use the term "story game" to mean any games about story, or even any and all roleplaying games, but when used in both those ways the history is much more vague and perhaps not as relevant to us here, today. This is why I choose to discuss the history of this specific kind of game that came out of the Forge instead of say pass-the-conch storytelling games in 19th century saloon culture. This is the history of how <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i> or almost any of the other Story Games favourites came to be, nothing more.<br/><br/>Now that we know what we're talking about, the history: Ron Edwards developed <i>Sorcerer</i> in the late '90s and published it in early '00s. Greg Stafford's <i>Hero Wars</i> is from about the same time-frame. <i>The Riddle of Steel</i>, the first edition of <i>Burning Wheel</i>, <i>InSpectres</i>, <i>Puppetland</i>, <i>Pool</i> and I'm sure other games I forget are from this era as well. These games were the landscape against which the discussion and game development at the Forge happened early on. They shared things that made them relevant to the new kind of approach that was being developed: they often had focus, analytic design, or they attempted to grasp at the creative ideal of Story Now in different ways. Sorcerer was of particular importance, as Ron himself was an active participant in theory and design, encouraging others into discovering their own roleplaying.<br/><br/>Next new games started to appear "from the Forge" - meaning from designers associated with the Forge to different degrees. It is important to acknowledge that none of the terms we commonly use to understand this history are Forge-specific: the Forge did not have a monopoly on being indie, or being narrativist, or being story game: all of these things were developing in independent currents as well through these years. The Forge was just the mainstream of this process. (I feel comfortable saying this due to the richness of publication and creative concord; the Forge was an artistic school or movement, while other people might have been doing similar things alone and independently.)<br/><br/>Important games in terms of artistic success and influence that came from the Forge include designs from Ron Edwards, Clinton R. Nixon, Vincent Baker, Ben Lehman, Matt Snyder, Paul Czege, Seth Ben-Ezra, Tim Kleinert, Matt Wilson, Emily Care Boss, Nathan Paoletta, Jason Morningstar, Michael Miller, Ralph Mazza, Mike Holmes,  Tony Lower-Basch, Raven Daegmorgan, Tim Koppang and myself, perhaps. (I mention designers instead of games because usually the entire oeuvre of the designer has significance if one of his games does.)  Jared Sorensen should also be mentioned - his design is picture-perfect Forge in terms of cultural history, and he's been an extremely important influence, even if he's kept his distance socially. There are others also, definitely, but I tried to stop the list somewhere, and I'm not going to spend hours sorting out whom to mention.<br/><br/>A nimbus of games from those designers came out in roughly 2002-2006 (petering out until ~2008 or so), which might be considered the core period of the Forge. During this time the action and attention was mostly focused on the Forge. Later on these designers and others continued working on their projects, but the social contact has been more occasional, and the influence has widened - there are now many designers who create "story games" in this tradition, or for an audience consisting primarily of this tradition, who never had much of a direct relationship to the Forge.<br/><br/>The recognizable traits of games in the Forge tradition you probably know: conflict resolution, explicit narration-sharing, resource mechanics, explicit game-end conditions, narrow and replicable game experience and so on. Not quite everything that we see in story games of 2013 was in there, and some things that were are less popular now, but I take this mostly as a continuous evolution - the core is the same. Most significant is that these trends in what kind of games were made were caused by active communication and excitement towards similar goals in gaming; the activity was that of an artistic school, which explains how come these designers created games that share important similarities with each other.<br/><br/>This following era we're in now is commonly called the Forge "diaspora" because of the way people have gone on their own ways. The culture of story games has been enriched by e.g. Nordic freeform influences and the OSR movement (both of which are other examples of artistic schools of thought in roleplaying, if you ask me). If I had to list important games of the diaspora era, I'd mostly have to list popular titles; it's too recent to know which will have long-term influence, and as the social aspect is more diverse, there's no convenient forum-membership label to use in judging who is particularly "story games" and who's just dipping their toe into it. All the people from the Forge are still important in their more recent work, of course, they mostly haven't died or anything.<br/><br/>That's the nutshell version. Of course we could go into past antecedents (all these designers take influence from the earlier decades of gaming, obviously), individual games and how they've shaped thinking, and what kind of transmittal of influences has happened between designers within this tradition, but that's all a very detailed topic, and if you just wanted to know where Fiasco or Dogs in the Vineyard come from, that's probably the most of it. Individual commentators will also naturally disagree on personal experiental details, such as which games were important (the ones I read and played) and which were not (the ones that I passed on). I recommend reading and playing the games of the aforementioned designers, and reading what they themselves state about their influences in their game texts.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404750/#Comment_404750" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-27T12:59:17+00:00" title="January 27, 2013 12:59PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2013 1:02PM by Graham.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I will clarify that I'm interested in the history of story-games, the things, not (primarily) the history of this site, though I realize that they are tied to each other.</blockquote>\nFor me, it goes something like this: <br/><br/>Ron set up The Forge, which encouraged people to publish their games themselves. At the time, these were called indie games.<br/><br/>This website, which started as an offshoot of the Forge (near enough), was called Story Games, a jokey term invented by Clinton R Nixon. Naturally, that term has become its own thing. <br/><br/>So indie games were the games associated with the Forge. And story games, the things, are the games associated with Story Games, the website. The history of the games is the history of those websites. (The games have some characteristics in common! We can talk about those, too, but the games aren't <i>defined</i> by those characteristics.)<br/><br/>That's the whole history, for me. It's basically about The Forge. And then there are other self-published games: we can argue whether they belong within that tradition or outside it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander" title="Rob_Alexander"><img alt="Rob_Alexander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/638/nM7WEDAVEW1RY.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rob_Alexander">Rob_Alexander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404804/#Comment_404804" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T01:55:19+00:00" title="January 28, 2013  1:55AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason - Eero's right, what you're saying is nuts.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JamesWallis" title="JamesWallis"><img alt="JamesWallis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/784/nRE4NE8PE1IZX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JamesWallis">JamesWallis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404825/#Comment_404825" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T08:36:17+00:00" title="January 28, 2013  8:36AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2013 8:44AM by JamesWallis.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>a series of experimental story games were published in the late '90s by Hogshead Publishing, including such as <i>Baron von Munchausen</i>,</blockquote>\n<i>The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen</i>\n<blockquote><i>De Profundis</i>, <i>Pantheon</i> - was that Hogshead? - </blockquote>\nYes, Pantheon was Hogshead.

I'm thinking of games like Fudge, Risus, and the Window. Larger game companies jumped on this bandwagon by producing simplified versions of their rules and making them available for free (e.g. GURPS Lite, Savage Worlds).<br/><br/>This is somewhat interesting because many of these designers were active on Usenet (the first significant RPG theory community on the internet, as far as I know), and some of them became Forge "regulars" later on.<br/><br/>These games were designed to be free (e.g. FUDGE originally stood for "Free Universal Donated Game Engine"), distributed online, and tried to appeal to people interested in a "focus on story" by cutting out rules which supported mechanical challenge/character optimization or detailed simulation.<br/><br/>I think these ideas influenced the Forge, although the later games produced during the early Forge period evolved significantly from this movement by deconstructing the GM-player relationship (or narrative authority) as well as by attempting "focused design" (in Forge terms, building the game to support a coherent Creative Agenda).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404828/#Comment_404828" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T09:13:32+00:00" title="January 28, 2013  9:13AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2013 9:14AM by J_Walton.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>If you don't see "a continuous practice" or "a publishing history of logical influence", perhaps you should look harder.</blockquote>\nQFT. What James was doing with the New Style line (Hi, James!) was the closest to what the Forge was doing, before the Forge ever existed. It's hugely important, I would argue. There may not be directly links, in terms of the people specifically working on various projects, but it was very much a thing that was happening. The Forge might have still come into being without folks like James and Robin Laws and Steffan O'Sullivan and Greg Costikyan and John Tynes etc. (I don't know, we'd have to ask Ron + Clinton), but for it to have the impact it did (both in terms of finding an audience and connecting with other would-be indie designers)... that part rests on the critical work that was happening before and alongside it. The intellectual/design tradition there is a key part of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404831/#Comment_404831" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T09:56:17+00:00" title="January 28, 2013  9:56AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Before it gets to abstract, what did for example Robin D Laws and Greg Costikyan (two of my favourite designers) have in common that made them important enough to be name dropped in a thread like this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JamesWallis" title="JamesWallis"><img alt="JamesWallis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/784/nRE4NE8PE1IZX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JamesWallis">JamesWallis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404832/#Comment_404832" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T09:58:33+00:00" title="January 28, 2013  9:58AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Costikyan and Laws both wrote articles for <i>Interactive Fantasy</i> and had titles published in Hogshead's New Style line.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404834/#Comment_404834" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T10:02:49+00:00" title="January 28, 2013 10:02AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that as far as continuous practice and community go, it's important to recognize the continuity of the 1990s with The Forge.  <br/><br/>Fudge was designed by Steffan O'Sullivan with active input from the community on the rec.games.design newsgroup in the early 1990s.  In the sister newsgroup rec.games.frp.advocacy, there were developing discussions of diverse styles of play including the Threefold Model of Gamist, Simulationist, and Dramatist - coming out of discussions of contrasting styles notably including the diceless, rotating-GM, explicit-drama-mechanics RPG Theatrix (1993).  Discussion of this spread out to other gaming discussion forums including The Gaming Outpost, the website where Ron Edwards picked up this model and discussed it with others like Scarlet Jester who formulated Exploration as a core concept.  This was then steadily modified into GNS with the founding of The Forge.  There was also some cross-over into the short-lived Interactive Fantasy and the Hogshead "New Style" RPGs, which fed back into rec.games.frp - but newsgroups were in the process of dying out. Many people came to The Forge in the early 2000s unaware of the predecessors - just as there are people coming in now who aren't aware of The Forge as a predecessor of Story Games.  <br/><br/>The Forge and ENWorld both became centers for large number of self-publishers for several years (roughly 2001 - 2006), riding on the new trend of web-based publishing.  The theory forum was closed down in 2005, I think, and the Story Games forum was started soon after (early 2006 ?).  <br/><br/>On another note, I would agree that "games with dice pools" isn't a good parallel to Impressionism, but I also don't think that either of "traditional" or "indie trend" are good parallels to Impressionism.  I think a closer parallel to schools like Impressionism is my own breakdown of fashions in RPG design:  <br/><br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/fashions.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/theory/fashions.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404835/#Comment_404835" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T10:08:58+00:00" title="January 28, 2013 10:08AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2013 10:13AM by Rickard.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Costikyan and Laws both wrote articles for <i>Interactive Fantasy</i> and had titles published in Hogshead's New Style line.</blockquote>\nYeah, I know what they did, but I was more interesting in general design ideas than the actual work.

What I should have said is that I don't see a continuous practice and a chain of influence from this era of experimental design on to the Forge, and then on to Story Games, socially speaking. Clearly you guys had your own scene in the late '90s, but I don't see a direct social link to the Forge. When I'm asked where story games as a gaming style comes from, I stand with what I said before: the Forge collected together a lot of people interested in this sort of design, they brought their influences (including experimental game design from earlier years), and that pretty much defines the story games scene, until in the last few years we've seen mix-ups of non-Forgean cultural subject matter.<br/><br/>Being a respected model and antecedent of the Forge is nothing to scoff at, but it is not the same thing as being an active participant and personal influence. I'm cool with starting a history of story games by tracing pre-Forge influence, but then it's a good idea to differentiate between text-transmitted influences and direct social contact between peers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_404842">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404842/#Comment_404842" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T11:03:02+00:00" title="January 28, 2013 11:03AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Clearly you guys had your own scene in the late '90s, but I don't see a direct social link to the Forge.

For example, Ron Edwards explicitly cited my influence via my Threefold Model FAQ in the first formulation of GNS in Sorcerer, even though I had never written directly to him at that point.  Robin Laws' Hero Wars was also an explicit influence at the Forge even though Robin never participated in discussion there.  There was a "Hero Wars" subforum on The Forge where the game was discussed, one of the earliest created (in June 2001).  It seems odd to draw the line at "text-transmitted influence" since The Forge itself was primarily a repository for articles and posts - i.e. <i>text</i>.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404845/#Comment_404845" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T11:15:09+00:00" title="January 28, 2013 11:15AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 28, 2013 11:20AM by J_Walton.">edited January 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, look at the games Ron reviewed early on in the Forge's history (before I ever joined): <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/reviews/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/reviews/</a><br/><br/>- Puppetland (by John Tynes)<br/>- Hero Wars (by Stafford/Laws)<br/><br/>The connection between the 1990s folks and the Forge is pretty strong.<br/><br/>P.S.

For example, Sorcerer was originally written and released online prior to the founding of The Forge, but I would still call it part of story games.  I'm pretty sure that the original Riddle of Steel and Burning Wheel were also created without any Forge influence, along with FATE.  <br/><br/>I think John Tynes' Puppetland, Jonathan Tweet's Everway, and Robin Laws' Hero Wars were all key influences on the Forge-related games of the 2000s.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_404852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/404852/#Comment_404852" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-28T11:44:51+00:00" title="January 28, 2013 11:44AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The original versions of Sorcerer, TROS, BW, and FATE all pre-dated the Forge, yes.
