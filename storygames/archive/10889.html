I'm not really sure what to say about it, other than it's kind of like the card game war (random and pointless) but I thought I might as well put it up here to be viewed. Also, I may have been more than a little bit inspired by 3:16, so I have noticed the similarity, yes.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Space War</b></span><br/><br/>It is a time of intergalactic war. Millions of space troopers are deployed on hundreds of worlds, fighting for something or other. It doesn\u2019t matter. There are heroes out there somewhere, but they aren\u2019t here to save you. You\u2019re here to die.<br/><br/>You play a <b>Space Trooper</b>: All troopers have the same stats and equipment, and names are irrelevant. <br/><br/>You have Three <b>Health</b>: When this hits zero, you\u2019re down. If it goes negative, you die.<br/><br/><b>Armor</b>: This stops two damage per attack on you. It\u2019s not much, but it helps.<br/><br/><b>Weapons</b>: 1d4- energy pistol or melee, 1d6- rail rifle, 1d8- heavy gun or grenade, 1d10 energy cannon<br/><br/>You have a blade for melee, a rail rifle, and two grenades.<br/><br/><b>Skills</b>: Roll three or better on a d6: Shoot, hide, run. Roll five or better on a d6: anything else <br/><br/><b>Scenario</b>: You and a huge group of other space troopers are on some planet. It\u2019s full of ruined buildings and stretches of open ruined plaza, obviously having once been a major population center of some sort. <br/><br/>The sky is full of laser blasts and dueling ships, fire and bombs rain down at regular intervals, and the sounds of explosions and gunfire are muffled only by constant screams and chatter. <br/><br/>You\u2019ve been told via holo-com by your superiors that you need to take a building the enemy is hiding in. It\u2019s across a huge plaza from the ruined multi-level structure your team is in, which looks like an abandoned parking garage. In the way are hundreds of aliens and other troopers battling it out, as well as many enemy tanks. <br/><br/>As you make your way across you\u2019d be wise to skirt buildings, which requires hide and run rolls interspersed with your shooting. Alternatively, you can run across the plaza. If you skirt the edge, you get to the building after ten run rolls succeed for each player. If you run across you need just five run rolls. <br/><br/>Every time you fail a hide roll, or every roll if you take the plaza, enemies spot you. Roll to see which:<br/><br/>On a d6: <br/>1-3: 1d10 aliens (same as you in every way)<br/> 4-5: 1d6 aliens and 1d6 alien elites with heavy guns and five health<br/> 6: a tank with ten health and five armor and three energy cannons (that need a 5 or better to hit)<br/><br/>Add one to the roll if you ran through the plaza. <br/><br/>The amount of foes is merely the amount that you have to deal with- if someone gets mouthy and asks how many there actually are roll the same die again and add that many more for them to deal with. Any ones described but not fought are killed by NPCs or escape. That or you leave the engagement prematurely (aka flee- possible via a run or hide roll). <br/><br/>If you die, take over control of another space trooper in your group, who jumps in immediately. There\u2019s always more, you\u2019re not keeping a tally but a bunch die in every conflict. <br/><br/>Once you get to the building it\u2019s bombed and everyone dies, but the battle is won. Game over.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mordheim" title="mordheim"><img alt="mordheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.darkreign40k.com/drjoomla/images/comprofiler/tn62_47cea863027df.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mordheim">mordheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241555/#Comment_241555" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-11T22:46:48+00:00" title="November 11, 2009 10:46PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you read 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars by Gregor Hutton?<br/>\n<br/>\nI advise you to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241650/#Comment_241650" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T10:35:53+00:00" title="November 12, 2009 10:35AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: whiteknife</cite>Also, I may have been more than a little bit inspired by 3:16, so I have noticed the similarity, yes.</blockquote>\nI rest my case. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241705">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241705/#Comment_241705" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-12T13:01:45+00:00" title="November 12, 2009  1:01PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's veeeery similar.
