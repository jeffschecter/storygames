My villain was a little too obvious. I was doing all right masking the villain until in one scene where I slipped on my words a bit and it became very obvious that he was the bad guy here, and it was in a talking encounter between him and one Dog. This Dog happened to be played by  player who has, for his whole RPG career, played Barbarian types. He went straight for the attack, as I figured was going to happen once I slipped up. Now, he had ended up soloing something pretty nasty and my dice were on fire, so I bruised him up pretty bad before he gave, so hopefully he won't just jump into flat-out combat again, but the root of the problem lies with me here. My villain was, well, a villain.<br/><br/>How do you better create moral greys for the Dogs to struggle with? One thing I saw in the players was that we all had a bit of an issue remembering to separate our own beliefs from the ones of the Faith, so we either could see that someone is doing bad by our standards or it had to be pointed out that some activity was NOT normal, giving away that something was suspicious. Help on how to do this in general would be awesome, especially if I can apply the idea to other games with moral greys as well. Thanks in advance!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355931/#Comment_355931" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T12:33:29+00:00" title="January 25, 2012 12:33PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: horn_head_o</cite>I was doing all right masking the villain</blockquote>\nI don't think you should be "masking" things in DITV, you're supposed to be actively revealing the town in play. As you say, I think your bigger problem is that you had a "villain". One rule of thumb I started using when creating towns is that a single NPC shouldn't be the linchpin of all of the tension in the town, since killing a person in a single conflict is possible, and a town that can be "fixed" in a single conflict isn't meaty enough for a full session. If you go through the town creation process by just making one bad person keep escalating through the stages I find they tend to create that "villain" scenario. It tends to get more interesting when you have the <i>victim</i> of one stage escalate to another stage. So someone who is sinned against adopts false doctrine, things like that. It tends to make for more sympathetic NPCs. The other thing to do is to get relationships that the Dogs already care about (or kin, if they don't have anything else you can use) mixed up in the situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355932">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355932/#Comment_355932" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T12:35:14+00:00" title="January 25, 2012 12:35PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you follow the Town Creation rules? It might be easier to figure out how you ended up with such an obvious villain if we knew more about the town you created.<br/><br/>But also, your repeated mentions of 'slip ups' and making something too obviously 'suspicious' are already solid clues that you may have ended up with an untenable/unworkable town. Suspicious things are supposed to be obvious in Dogs -- your job when playing the town is to get everything out in the open as quickly as possible, including the fact that so-and-so is obviously hiding something, and so-and-so is lying to you about X. If you are trying to hide the fact that someone has done something, or if players jumping on some action or another as suspicious is a problem, then you're already in trouble.<br/><br/>Like for example, it is really not a problem if players have trouble separating their own beliefs from the ones of the Faith, or if they immediately jump on someone for 'doing bad by our standards', or that you have to hang a big obvious Sin sign on things that are sinful in the eyes of the Faithful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues" title="entropyblues"><img alt="entropyblues" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thejosefkstories.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/cropped-josefkbridge.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/entropyblues">entropyblues</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355933/#Comment_355933" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T12:37:47+00:00" title="January 25, 2012 12:37PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in the process of getting ready for my first session, so take this with a ton of salt, but...<br/><br/>There's a part of the commentary track on the Firefly episode "Out of Gas" where Joss Whedon tosses of this point about how he writes, and I'm paraphrasing here: "Every character, no matter how small, believes they are the main character of the story, and that they are ultimately in the right." <br/><br/>That kind of blew my mind when I first heard it, and pretty well changed the way I wrote. I think that meshes really well with the advice on pg 138 of Dogs: "You can't have a hero or a villain among your NPC's. It's the PC's choices that make them so."<br/><br/>Of course, looking back at my own DitV thread here, I flubbed both points to a certain degree and am in the process of cleaning that up, but I think you can create moral greys by knowing how and why each character thinks they are doing the right thing, and bringing them into opposition with each other. Good vs Good is the most interesting conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355936/#Comment_355936" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T13:17:27+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  1:17PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you want moral ambiguity, just have people doing their best in a bad situation.

Always keep in mind what your players are comfortable with and try not to cross any of their lines or touch on any topics that they are sensitive to.<br/><br/><br/><b>- It starts with you.</b> Don't think of the villain as a villain. Maybe they're the "bad guy" because they are misunderstood, misled, desperate, panicking, selfish or cowardly but don't want to hurt anyone, a victim lashing out, confused, someone who was bullied and has now become the bully (but doesn't know it), an outcast, or just the wrong person at the wrong time.<br/><br/><b>- In their mind, the villain is the hero or victim.</b> Their actions are justified. Maybe that's just cognitive dissonance talking, but they honestly think they are right. The trick here is to not make them crazy. Make it so that if the situation was a little different\u2026 they could actually, without making it a stretch, be right! Their justifications should be reasonable and based on something. If you squint, you might even be able to convince yourself that they are indeed justified. <br/><br/><b>- They tried your way first.</b> First give the villain a clear goal. Then make sure the villain's reasons for needing this goal make sense. Finally, make it so that the villain tried other ways to accomplish their goals (playing nice or doing what the dogs would do) but failed and they now feel this is the only way.<br/><br/><b>- Faceless people are easy to judge.</b> So give them a face. Grab a photo from IMDB and tell the players, "this is who you see." Better yet, make it someone they like in real life. Or someone they would be attracted to or feel sorry for. Don't choose someone who looks like a villain, that they hate, or are jealous of.<br/><br/><b>- Good people do bad things for good reasons.</b> Bad people do good things for bad reasons. The bad people think they are the good people. The victims justifiably become the bullies. The bad people want to repent but the good people want revenge. The bad people are surrounded by people who love them and have good reasons for loving them. There are no bad people.<br/><br/><b>- Give them a family.</b> Surround them with NPCs who love or depend on the villain. <br/><br/><b>- The town needs them.</b> Make the town's survival tied directly to the villain.<br/><br/><b>- Make the villain a former Dog.</b> A sign of what the player characters might become.<br/><br/><b>- The Dogs know the villain.</b> Have the players related to the villain or to the people who love or depend on the villain. Make these relationships mechanical. Have the players say how they are related. Maybe they're blood relations. Maybe the villain saved their life, trained them, helped their family, made love to them, made them a Dog, lent them money, knows their secrets, looks up to them, trust them, loves them, saved them from sin. This works just as well when players have these types of relationships with NPCs who think the villain is in the right.<br/><br/><b>- Make the villain's personality relatable.</b> Look at the Dogs Traits, especially the Traits with the most dice, and give that same Trait to the villain! Say a Dog has the Trait, "good with animals", then make the villain great with animals! Surround the villain with animals. If you know the players well, take one of the player's real life Traits and give them to the villain. Say your friend hates adulterers; make the villain hate them to. Warning: go easy on this and don't do anything that would upset your friends or make them uncomfortable. <br/><br/><b>- Roleplay the villain as if they are real.</b> Write down the name of someone you know personally or a character you enjoy from film/tv/books next to the villain's name in your notes. Use this as a guideline for how to roleplay them. If the villain feels like a real person in your mind, or is based on a real person, then it will show in your roleplaying.<br/><br/><b>- Make the villain hard to hate.</b> Give the villain an adorable pet that loves the villain or an elderly family member that the villain takes care of. Make the villain pregnant or a single parent taking care of young children. Make the villain an outsider that the majority treated poorly. Give the villain a disability that they've worked hard to overcome. Make the villain an underdog. Warning: go easy on these, they are cheap tricks and sometimes in bad taste. <br/><br/><b>- Make sure the villain is never alone.</b> If the Dogs accuse the villain or yell at them\u2026 don't have the villain respond, instead have an on looking NPC react with disgust at the Dogs while the villain sits back, calm,<br/><br/><b>- Split the Dogs up!</b> Have their loved ones ask to speak to them privately. Have NPCs try to convince the Dogs that the villain isn't the person they should be worried about. <br/><br/><b>- Give the villain a name that's easy to remember.</b> Have the NPCs say their name multiple times till it sticks in the players' minds. <br/><br/><b>- Have the Dogs encounter the villain in their home.</b> Surrounded by all their stuff that makes them feel more human. For some reason, encountering a villain while they are eating food or cooking makes them feel especially human.<br/><br/><b>- Fill the town with sins the characters hate but the players don't! </b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355943">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355943/#Comment_355943" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T13:54:50+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  1:54PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>If you want moral ambiguity, just have people doing their best in a bad situation.

I love it when someone I thought was a nice person is someone that most of the players decide is a problem before the game even starts. And even better, I love how that can change again once they encounter the actual NPC in the town, trying to do their best in terrible situations. Sometimes they change their mind, sometimes they are convinced the NPC is hiding something, sometimes... actually... usually I have no idea what will happen and it makes running Dogs exciting for me because I don't know how any of it will turn out but I'll know soon enough!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355944/#Comment_355944" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T13:56:43+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  1:56PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, all I can say is "don't skip Town Creation and just make a town you think is interesting".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o" title="horn_head_o"><img alt="horn_head_o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/horn_head_o">horn_head_o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355952/#Comment_355952" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-25T14:31:09+00:00" title="January 25, 2012  2:31PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm understanding this better now.
