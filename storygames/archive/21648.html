And now this method is super board game like/inspired. But hey hobgoblins of consistency and what not\u2026</small></p><p>The examples are going to be very specific for 5e\u2019s foraging rules, and the specific condition of the water of the particular module we\u2019re running. But you can use similar ideas for anything: rocket fuel in Stars Without Number, w/e.</p><p>I got out some wooden disks in four colors. Yellow is food, blue is pure water, black is risky water, and gray is for \u201ccompromised\u201d water \u2013 a house rule one of my players proposed, that if you don\u2019t have Brewer\u2019s proficiency you can still TRY to boil it and it\u2019s still risky but you have advantage on your con saves. One yellow disk one day\u2019s eating of food, two water disks one day\u2019s drinking of water.</p><p>The player\u2019s don\u2019t know yet the risk of the water here but they know they need to make con saves if they drink it.</p><p>There are different DCs, and different consequences, for drinking risky water and for drinking half water. (And drinking no water at all is auto exaustion level.)</p><p><small>ugh my keyboard just broke halfway through this post and my spare one sucks, I miss my topre switches T_T <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23iwritealot&amp;Mode=like">#iwritealot</a></small></p><p>I made five cards. One for each of the four raincatchers they carry, and one for foraging.</p><p>If they spend time being still with the raincatchers up, they will get pure water that way. The rate they fill up in different weathers (we do random weathers \u2013 they have Druidcraft to predict weather so we roll one day in advance) is written on the raincatchers themselves. So we put blue disks on those cards in that rate. Those rates I decided early on together with some help from a stack exchange post but I adapted it to the weather table we use (they had two rain levels, we have three (well, five if you add \u201cnone\u201d and \u201ctropical storm\u201d, the raincatchers wo\u2019t work then).</p><p>If they forage (survival vs DC depending on terrain, 10 for chultan jungle), they find food and risky water. If they succeed, they get 1d6+wis food (yellow disks) and a separate 1d6+wis risky water (black disks). (DMG p 111 \u2013 sometimes we do this as actually a little fishing scene or hunting, usually we just mechanics over it). So they have disks on their character sheets, in the raincatchers, and in the \u201cthis is what we foraged today\u201d pile. Some have negative wis and so don\u2019t find anything if the d6 is low.</p><p>Purifying is done at a rate of one disk in one hour but in eight hours you only do six disks. House rule that you can do this even without the proficiency in brewer\u2019s, but you get compromised water.</p><p>And then people can eat, stash food, refill their waterskins etc etc. If there is enough.<br/>The yellow disks weigh half as much as normal rations (a \u201csmall item slot\u201d instead of a \u201cration slot\u201d on our inventory sheets) but spoil after one day. (House rule\u2026 we tried a more realistic amount of days in our last campaign and it became a bit much to track.)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_473613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473613/#Comment_473613" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T07:19:38+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  7:19AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2018 7:29AM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<h2 id="bonus-ot-a-cheat">Bonus, OT: A cheat</h2><p>This is OT to the wooden disks thing but relevant to 5e\u2019s foraging rules.</p><p>This is a bit of illusion/force:</p><p>I thought that if someone wanted to play out a hunt, I could create an animal (land or fish) that had 2 HP, whose movement, perception etc I could cheat with so that the hunter could follow them for a while (maybe skip that part, that\u2019s too cheaty even for being with this cheat) and then the AC of the animal would be\u2026 and this is so dirty\u2026 but: 10 (for abundant terrain, 15 or 20 for harsher), minus the hunter\u2019s Survival, plus the hunter\u2019s attack bonus. (That would make the die roll equivalent to the hunter making a survival check.) Iow if River Mist, survival +6 to hit +5, wants to hunt they\u2019ll find an animal with 2 HP and AC 10.)</p><p>I.o.w. make it equivalent to making a normal foraging check.</p><p>And if they missed once the animal would scurry away. (And then if they had fictional positioned themselves so that the animal COULDN\u2019T scurry away, well, then they can have it. That\u2019s a just reward.)</p><p>Ooooor if the player is more about showing off their sneaking prowess than their shooting prowess, it\u2019s the stealth/perception roll that\u2019s adjusted in this way and then the AC is five or so. (They\u2019ll still miss on a 1, but\u2026 that can be cool too.) The animal\u2019s perception is 10 (or 15/20 if you\u2019re on Athas or something), + the hunter\u2019s stealth, minus the hunter\u2019s survival. Or if they want to show off their animal FINDING prowess\u2026 etc etc. You get it.</p><p>I don\u2019t have to feel guilty because I haven\u2019t used this trick yet because my players are aware of the foraging rule as it is, and they know that it represents hunting, fishing, finding berries and roots or w/e. The amount of food you get from the days catch is the usual 1d6+wis.</p><p>(Why even guilty? Because it invalidates a player choice (\u201cI want to use attack bonus\u201d) and instead makes it equivalent to another choice (\u201cI want to use Survival to forage\u201d). However\u2026 the rationale is this: the fact that they even CAN find an animal there, track it down etc etc, all that is Survival in the first place. If they were eating something from a random encounter, I wouldn\u2019t even think of using this cheat. This cheat is for when you need to create an animal wholecloth because they decided to go hunting/fishing.)</p><p>Again, haven\u2019t used it. Also because I just thought of it the other day. But I\u2019ve never done anything similar either.</p><p>PS: No need to keep this a secret from them that it works like this. You could start by saying something like \u201cOK your survival skill influences how good you are at finding easy prey\u201d or something.</p><p>Ugh this goes against how I use the rules sooo much. I never really \u201ccater to players\u201d (I mean, to the detriment of the game sometimes but it\u2019s just so hard to do the sandbox thing that\u2019s its also hard to customize things for them).</p><p>PPS what if multiple people hunt the same animal? I dunno it\u2019s up to you. take highest attack bonus and highest survival. or highest generated AC. or average of the generated ACs. and for the meat on the animal then xd6+y where x is number of hunters and y is total wis. I dunno. The foraging rule is a good guideline.</p><p>PPPS (and this is relevant to both this post and to my OP above):</p><p>Outlander ability is equivalent to finding 6 yellow food disks and 12 water disks, without making foraging rolls. Decide at your own table whether or not it stacks with making foraging rolls (at my table it doesn\u2019t) and what the risk level of the water disks are (at my table they\u2019re risky black and need to be purified, or drunk with con saves).</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_473614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/473614/#Comment_473614" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-09T07:27:32+00:00" title="May  9, 2018  7:27AM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 9, 2018 7:29AM by 2097.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Decide at your own table whether or not Outlander ability stacks with making foraging rolls (at my table it doesn\u2019t)</p></div></blockquote>\nAnd you can do you find 6 automatically <b>and</b> you can roll-forage, or you could do you find at <b>least</b> 6 and you can roll-forage for <b>possible</b> more, or you can do they choose every day whether to auto-forage or roll-forage.

Dice complement player choices well in this regard: "I try to do the smart things as regard my food and water.

Someone sees "Brewing" on the skill list and goes "Yeah! Brewing! Gotta have brewing! My character is totally a brewer!" and they take the skill, even though I, the GM, am quietly facepalming at its presence and wondering why the damn skill even exists in an adventuring game.  So "You can purify water with this!" helps give it a purpose.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>"Getting out from an icy lake after dropping through the ice", now that's a survival skill with justification.
