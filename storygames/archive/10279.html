She's has a traditional board game perspective, having played games with kids and her family all through childhood.<br/><br/>One of the first things she asked was how to win, which up til now I've not even addressed. I think hippie indie gamers might take it for granted that the story is the goal itself, without any sense of competition. So, I started thinking about ways to surreptitiously phrase the rules so that there is indeed a "winner," but not change the game at all.<br/><br/>In one sense, you could say the player with the <i>most</i> coins at the end of the game wins, but then that discourages people from sharing their coins. I had this experience playing with Megan. I asked if I could have some coins and she denied my request, kind of like if we were negotiating an exchange of resources in Settlers of Catan.<br/><br/>You could say the player with the <i>fewest</i> coins at the end of the game wins, which might encourage players to share their coins. The other benefit of having the fewest coins is that you get the last line in the story. Then again, that might just encourage players to just say fewer words so that they don't get any coins in the first place.<br/><br/>There might be a roundabout way of doing this, but it would introduce a new rule. You could say that players get one point for each coin they give to another player and the winner is whoever was the <i>most generous</i> at the end of the game.<br/><br/>But, with all these solutions I worry that introducing the word "win" might touch on Dan Pink's assertion that extrinsic rewards (victory) undermine intrinsic rewards (creating a story with your friends).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bevedog" title="bevedog"><img alt="bevedog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stevelawson.name/icons/steve-in-3D-32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bevedog">bevedog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228690/#Comment_228690" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-30T06:58:13+00:00" title="August 30, 2009  6:58AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I mostly think that playing this game to "beat" the other players would ruin it.<br/><br/>OTOH, I could see having different rewards or goals you could shoot for: longest word used, best plot twist, best use of a foreign phrase, silliest player, etc. <br/><br/>I could also see variations on the game where you have a group goal, and could win or lose as a team. Create a story without using the letter "e." Recapitulate the entire plot of a movie/play/novel with Robot as the protagonist. Make a story in terza rima.

Luckily as we've seen from the board games thread 90% of story gamers do not play <i>any</i> game to beat the other players. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> But still group victory seems way better. Even including an optional "if you like you can beat the other players by achieving x and y!" means that some personality types (who me?? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>) will feel they've lost if they do not use the optional win conditions, because "surely the author wouldn't have included them unless they were legitimately a good idea for those who enjoy <a href="http://www.sirlin.net/articles/playing-to-win-part-1.html" rel="nofollow">playing to win</a>". Yes, I've thought exactly that.<br/><br/>So, group victory... include the results of a sample game in the instructions. To win you must read your Robot storypoem and the sample one to someone who does not know what the hell you're doing, and make her choose which she liked better. If it's yours, you all win! Otherwise you have failed, do better. Once you win, for further play use your previous nonlosing story for comparison. And a new unsuspecting judge each time!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_228845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228845/#Comment_228845" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-31T04:25:21+00:00" title="August 31, 2009  4:25AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: bevedog</cite>The possibilities for group victory conditions are endless.</blockquote>\nIf you can think of a few more, I'll totally work those into the final game. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> That's one thing I liked while playing Cranium Wow!, that it's a family game where you're all trying to beat the clock together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229466">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/bevedog" title="bevedog"><img alt="bevedog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stevelawson.name/icons/steve-in-3D-32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/bevedog">bevedog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229466/#Comment_229466" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T22:14:14+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:14PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 10:16PM by bevedog.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>One of my friends who played our test round pointed out that my examples aren't exactly "group victory conditions" as much as they are another rule constraining the story.
