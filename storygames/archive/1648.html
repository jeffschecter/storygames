                    I'm going back to Japan in November for the first time in 3 years, and will be hooking up with my old gaming group and showing them some of the games we talk about here.  In the meantime, Andy Kitkowski's Japanese blog has inspired me to try writing a series of articles showcasing some of the more interesting parts of story games.  These are by no means complete translations (for a number of reasons).  If people over there read these and are interested, they can buy a copy of the game in question.  Consider these to be extended reviews.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you can read my broken Japanese you're welcome to check them out.  Constructive criticism is welcome.  I'm trying really hard to be neutral and not push a particular gaming philosophy on people, just show what's out there. (Hence the first article being titled "What Indie Games are to Me" not "THIS IS INDIE GAMING").<br/><br/><a href="http://blog.shadowcabinet.org/index.php/2006/10/19/%e7%a7%81%e3%81%ab%e3%81%a8%e3%81%a3%e3%81%a6%e3%81%ae%e3%82%a4%e3%83%b3%e3%83%87%e3%82%a3%e3%82%b2%e3%83%bc%e3%83%a0" rel="nofollow">Preface</a><br/><a href="http://blog.shadowcabinet.org/index.php/2006/10/22/the-shadow-of-yesterday-part-1" rel="nofollow">Part 1: The Shadow of Yesterday - Keys and Key Scenes</a> </div>

                            Awesome, dude!  This is actually something that I've wanted to do for a while but haven't had the time.  Keep rocking it hard.<br/><br/>Two things that I would suggest, though, if you want a Japanese audience:<br/><br/>1) Use d.hatena.ne.jp for your diary. It's pretty much the largest blogging site in Japan, and does native tagging and cross-linking for you. So if you post about TRPGs, åŒäººTRPG, or the specific names of games and the like, thos words will get aggregated into the DB: So if you click on them, you can find other people who used the same terms.  So you can easily find the blogs of people with similar interests, but more importantly, they can find yours.<br/><br/>My attempt (not updated in almost a year) is at d.hatena.ne.jp/ziggurat<br/><br/>There are other blogging sites in Japan, but they just aren't as popular or useful as hatena.  Ex: I also have a mixi journal, but that's more of a social networking blog than a "to be read by all" blog.<br/><br/>2) When you have like 1-2 more posts, feel free to contact the admin of www.trpg.net , he's a fan of English sites and cross-cultural communication, and will gladly post a link to your blog where appropriate. Just make sure you use a subject line like "TRPG.NET" or something CLEAR in Japanese, as he gets tons of spam and discards a lot of email that doesn't stick out.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Thanks for the advice.  I will do both of these things if it looks like I will be able to keep it going for a while.
<blockquote>BTW, when you mention your old gaming group, is it foreigners in Japan, or mostly Japanese natives? Just curious there.</blockquote>
All Japanese natives (except myself of course).  Now they are mostly doing D&amp;D3E, but they were much more eclectic when I first gamed with them.<br/><br/>There was an all-foreigners group in Sapporo when I went to college there, but I wasn't really into what they were playing (Skyrealms of Jorune run with Chaosium Runequest rules???).                        </div>
