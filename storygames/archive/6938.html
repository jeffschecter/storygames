But that seems to really miss out on the potential. If you are running a game where there's a person called something like a GM with narrative authority, I think we are falling short if that authority is essentially just used to describe the world. Director's have their vision. And yet, like RPGs, they aren't the sole creators (usually), in fact most often they didn't even write the thing, much less act it out. So, if authors and directors can bring in a style and voice, why not GMs? To stick to one method would be like having every novelist write like Stephen King and every director work like Steven Speilburg.<br/><br/>Some ideas for styles:\n<ul>\n<li>Arrested Narration - unreliable and contradictory to actions and dialog, turning dramatic irony up to 11.<br/></li><li>How Fred Savage Met Your Mother - a character narrates from a point of view of experience, long after the events are over, with ample nostalgia, regret, and sentimentality.<br/></li><li>Historical Professor (inspired by World War Z) - events are presented as interpretations of uncovered artifacts, documents, or other evidence (academic or theory based bias optional).<br/></li><li>Epic Veda - inspired by John Wick talking about the primary sources for the ven in Houses of the Blooded. Homer, Beowolf, Middle English poetry, whatever your style of preference. Lofty language, repeated phrases, and if your good enough a particular cadence or even rhyming.<br/></li><li>The Stan Lee Cameo - Describing scenes only as still panels, anything not visual is said as if it were written in a box on the panel.<br/></li><li>The Tarantino Method - Scenes and events structured to build to a climax, regardless of the chronology (this is sort of an ur-style that could be combined with another, I think).<br/></li><li>Hard Boiled - That well known Chandler style of narration now required for every Private Investigator license. Although like any first person narrative, this would be tricky with a PC as the narrator, and might need to be an observing NPC (but who? That's the tricky part).<br/></li><li>The Faulkner-Joyce Gambit - Stream of consciousness, poetic, but PCs speak and act concretely. Would this even work? I'd love to try.</li>\n</ul>\nWhat else might work?   Or better yet, have you tried something like this and how did it go?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154519/#Comment_154519" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T15:15:25+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  3:15PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oy.

The epic, and stream of consciousness ones are the only ones that seem really tricky, and only because those are really trickly styles to do right. Hard Boiled is tricky, like any 1st person one would be, if the "1st person" is a PC anyway (but solutions can be worked out with the group). But the others are really just sticking to a particular style. I've done the comic book one running With Great Power... (and that's inspired partly from the use of thought bubbles and discussion of painting panels from the book). The rest seem pretty easy.<br/><br/>Confessionals is a good one.  Does it do it in a Reality TV show emulation?  Something where the characters talk directly to the audience about what they are thinking is a great one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154535">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog" title="Z-Dog"><img alt="Z-Dog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Z-Dog">Z-Dog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154535/#Comment_154535" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T16:27:49+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  4:27PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            unreliable narrator sounds like wicked fun                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154543">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154543/#Comment_154543" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-02T17:21:32+00:00" title="July  2, 2008  5:21PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My comment comes mainly from the structural problem that retrospective or omniscient narration relies on a knowledge of the story-as-a-whole.

I didn't use it all the time. Sometimes the purpose of narration is to get some facts across.  The players have to be able to accept the facts I'm giving them at least for the reality of the story.  If I say in a non-narrator voice that there are 3 stormtroopers in the room, it's not a dead lock guarantee that there are 3 stormtroopers in the room, but it means that the players can count on my narrator <i>believing</i> that there are 3 stormtroopers in the room and telling the story as if there were.<br/><br/>Another tactic I used was to murder the entire party in the first session, and then amend it.  "And so it was they were all blown to smithereens. Or so we were led to believe. However, I actually think that they survived. Certain evidence has come to my attention that things went very differently. For you see, there was a third ship in the system.  Recall their arrival in the system..." and replaying the whole scene. <br/><br/>I also did a "cut scene" session in which the narrator was describing a formative episode in the career of two of the villains - passed out NPC sheets and treated them the same way as I did the regular player characters.<br/><br/>I had the narrator (in his own voice) make exaggerated conclusions from the facts which we had just played through. That way the players could grin and laugh at him, and know not everything he said was completely true.<br/><br/>I had him comment disparagingly about some of the conversations people were having.  "She said this, perhaps forgetting that blah blah blah blah." I did this to show that the player characters were separate from him, he didn't have control over what they "had done" in any way, they were independent actors.<br/><br/>*ponder*<br/><br/>The only thing that was maybe a bit too ambitious for this project was that I used flashbacks. Now, I've used flashbacks for many years. It's no big deal.  However, when you have a narrator who is describing the events of the game as if they've already happened, you have an inherent flashback (flash forward?) already built into the structure of the game.<br/><br/>So the "real" timeline of the game might be:<br/><br/>1. Characters join Rebel Alliance<br/>2. Characters have dashing adventures.<br/>3. Characters are ambushed after Empire falls.<br/>4.  Narrator researches ambush of characters, adventures.<br/>5. Characters have exciting adventures.<br/>6.  Narrator tells a New Republic committee about his findings.<br/><br/>A "normal" game with your standard omniscient, non-character narrator would go:<br/><br/>1, 2, 3, 5<br/><br/>A game with flashbacks might go:<br/><br/>3, 1, 2, 5<br/><br/>But because I used "flashbacks" in the telling of the story, and didn't tell the players how the narrator knew what he know, it went like this:<br/><br/>6, 3, 6, 1, 6, 2, 6, 5<br/><br/>For example, at one point in the game, a player pointed out that:<br/><br/>In the "flashbacks", the characters were on Hoth just before the events of Empire Strikes Back<br/>In the "present day", they were plotting to get out of a Hutt-run private prison<br/>And in the narrator's timeline, not only was he talking to the committee, but "something else was happening too", in other words, in the narrators remarks, he was describing things that had not yet happened in the PCs "present day"<br/><br/>This was three timelines and very hard to keep track of.<br/><br/>If I had gone straight through on the PC's timeline I think it might have been better.<br/><br/>Still, as it was, I had a whole hell of a lot of fun with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154682/#Comment_154682" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T11:13:19+00:00" title="July  3, 2008 11:13AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2008 11:46AM by Jogesh EZ.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>This is one of the areas where GM-runs-the-world excels - you may not know the story as a whole, but you can hit within the second ring around the bullseye pretty reasonably if you keep your eyes open.</blockquote>\nYes, exactly. It's precisely because the GM-runs-the-world that I started brainstorming more ways to do it (although Paul T's idea sounds awesome, it does give two players very non-traditional roles, which may or may not work for them in games where the GM holds the primary authority - though it actually sounds like a good idea for a Polaris mod).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Shaggy Dog story - Keep exaggerating until someone calls bullshit.

Wikipedia saved me from that mistake. Risky (don't want to defuse the climax), but sounds like a fun style to try. <br/><br/>Actually, it makes me think combining the two might be good. If someone calls bullshit in the Folksy Shaggy Dog, switch narrators. Turns out, it's a story being recounted around the camp fire. "Naw, that ain't how it went at all...."<br/><br/>Which makes me think of broad ways of telling stories. Who's telling the story, and why? Each answer seems to produce its own style.<br/><br/>Princess Bride, anyone? We have a parent (or other respected relative) reading a bedtime story. The kid could be the players collectively. <br/>Big Lebowski was a good call from Joe. A cowboy (or other sterotypical storytelling type) in the characters' hang out place who knows them personally.<br/>There's also: <br/>Scarey After S'mores - Campfire ghost story<br/>This is my Homework - A kid reading a story in front of class (or even doing a book report)<br/>Courtly Presentation - A bard before royalty<br/>Rock Opera - Only if you are musically inclined, or perhaps if your players will put up with bad ad-libbed lyrics (I think mine would).<br/>Under your Window, telling a Tale - A man impressing a woman (or vice versa) with a story<br/>Verbal Recount - A witness (or even series of witnesses) reporting events to a police officer.<br/><br/>Also though of:<br/>Welcome to Grover's Corners - A completely self aware narrator who breaks the fourth wall to address the audience (players) directly. Although, it would have to be a "character" otherwise you end up with what the GM does anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154693">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154693/#Comment_154693" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-03T12:20:39+00:00" title="July  3, 2008 12:20PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2008 12:23PM by JDCorley.">edited July 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't believe I forgot to post this earlier thread:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3005" rel="nofollow">Fiction of Objectivity</a>, includes the story of my first ever unreliable narrator, in a Gotham City game.

In 2003 I made a RPG-tournament on witches called <i>Eburanja </i>(named after a living castle). In that tournament we used something called "the impressionistic method". It was fairly simple: we the GMs would set a scene and play it as normal, but at some point before the conclusion of any conflict we would cut to a new scene, at a inn or back home, the same night or the day after. The characters where gathered in safe surroundings, discussing the "outcome" of the conflict (the players had to imagine an outcome and make it up during the conversation).<br/><br/>This method made for some very strange and sometimes beautiful scenes. The players (once more strangers at a convention) were baffled and confused at first, but they grew into it quite fast. Some of them had the game of their life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_154845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154845/#Comment_154845" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-04T10:07:06+00:00" title="July  4, 2008 10:07AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3005" rel="nofollow">Fiction of Objectivity</a>, includes the story of my first ever unreliable narrator, in a Gotham City game.

The Gotham one reminds me of general propaganda. From a bragging thug to the inspirational speech that comprises 300.  Also the inexplicable first person of Christmas Carol. Thanks for linking that!  The quote that starts it from Joshua really opens up a cool way of think about it, and part of what I want to do. Running games in the "this is how we say it happened" style instead of "this is really how it happened".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>How about this one: the player roll the die; a 6, and smiles. The narrator looks at the die, and dryly tells him: "Ah, you rolled a 2. You miss the target"!</blockquote>\nThere's potential there for narration styles. Could you do Calvanist, or other philosophical driven narratives, as Deliverator suggests?  What uses might this have besides alienation? \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tomas HVM</cite>The characters where gathered in safe surroundings, discussing the "outcome" of the conflict (the players had to imagine an outcome and make it up during the conversation).</blockquote>\nVery cool.  Very cinematic. How often has we seen an action movie, where after its been established that our hero is a bad ass, but facing the bad guy is still far away (narratively speaking) that we just see the beginning or part of the fight, or one that's presented without any tension for the outcome but to show us cool stuff? My answer: often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_154848">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/154848/#Comment_154848" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-04T10:31:03+00:00" title="July  4, 2008 10:31AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/><br/>Thanks for the description and links!
