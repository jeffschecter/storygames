Here's how that went:<br/><br/><b>The Good</b><br/>I got to meet a lot of new people, like Marhault/Jamey, Bill, and others (lots of putting faces to names)<br/>I got to run some really good sessions.<br/>Columbus has lots of excellent food and entertainment. Near our place was a Tea House, and it was incredible. Northern Market, with its collection of about every ethnic food out there (save African), was awesome as well: I had many "fast meals" which were healthy and not shitty-tasting.<br/>Bought lots of cool, unexpected shit like the board/debate game "Who Would Win?", and the RPG "Vox" (which I knew was coming, but it totally caught me off-guard with how awesomely it is put together. Mike doesn't do enough promo for his shit).<br/>Lots of cool small-press gaming events going down, a lot being run by people I'd never heard of/met.<br/>Relaxing time: A good vacation-oid.<br/><br/><b>The Bad</b><br/>ORIGINS was the worst-organized con of any con that I can recall, even local cons run by college kids. Now, I realize that others had no problem, but:<br/><br/>* Every single event I listed ended up listed online correctly, but incorrectly in the Con Book. Which led to two of my games getting canceled due to no-shows. <br/>(later, I was able to put together some great pick-up games instead, but I feel sorry for the folks who came expecting a game but got a canceled event due to no-shows)<br/>* Every single event that Jerry G listed ended up having problems except for one: Two events got listed in the same time slot, another event was listed 2 weeks before the con was supposed to begin!  In the end, "the computers" had the info listed correctly, but the guidebooks were fucked.<br/>* The guides didn't have maps of the gaming areas. They printed out some later, but no one could have one because they only had about 6 copies. So you had to go to the info booth, look at the map, and "remember it" all the way to your event. Wasn't a huge deal once we got used to the con, but for newcomers this was fucking annoying.<br/>* RPG/LARP information booth had no information. "Sorry, they were supposed to give us a laptop, but there's no wireless, so we can't actually help you with any questions about scheduled events".<br/>* Far less attendees than last year. Some of it I'd put on "The Economy", which is true. <br/><br/>I've heard awesome stories, like from Bill from The Escapist, who ran extremely successful kids-oriented sessions. About half the stories I've heard have been "The con was organized great and my events were cool" and the other half "All my events had problems/were listed wrong/gave the wrong info leading to cancellations and confusion."<br/><br/>Dunno if I'll be back. I think it'll need to improve for a few years (attendance, organization) before I'll give it my time again. I loved meeting folks, but local cons do what Origins did, but better. Still, Columbus is a far more awesome city than I first thought.<br/><br/>Anyone else? Chime on in.<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216027/#Comment_216027" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T12:00:14+00:00" title="July  2, 2009 12:00PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote about <a href="http://mrteapot.livejournal.com/77031.html" rel="nofollow">my con experience over on my livejournal</a>.

Sorry I didn't make it back around to chat at you some more, but every time I came by your table, you were talking with one or more people and I didn't want to interrupt. Also, I am working my way through Maid RPG with a mixture of laughter and shock. Can't wait to bring it to the table.<br/><br/>This was definitely a transition year for the con, as there were a lot of mistakes which shouldn't have been made, but also a lot of new people in the drivers seat. We the press had a conference on Friday with the new PR person and it turned into a gripe session because there were absolutely no resources for the press. No computers, no press releases, nothing. I know a lot of stuff got omitted from the on-site booklet as well. Monte Cook was left out entirely and had to twitter the times and locations of his different seminars, which means all the people sitting at home following him on twitter knew where he was and when, but the people at the convention had to search, and many never found him at all.<br/><br/>This was the most frustrating Origins I've been to in the last several years that I've gone, but the saving grace was getting to shake a lot of hands and hook up with a lot of cool people. I am hoping GAMA can get their act together for next year, and I actually say that in a positive tone, because I think they will improve.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216057/#Comment_216057" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T14:10:58+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  2:10PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 2, 2009 2:12PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Did you guys hear about the "rent-a-girl" thing in the vendor area?

Cue jaw dropping in the same way as when I first saw those Avelanche Press "Chick from Culture X Squatting on the cover in barely held-together clothing looking like she's going to fuck or kill you" d20 supplements. Baaaah.<br/><br/>Then, I met the d20babes 'pimp'. Nice enough guy, runs some Ohio gaming league or something. Still, though, "d20babes"? Fuck.<br/><br/>But THEN, as I was complaining about this to another girl about "booth babes" (specifically, the difference between "booth babes", who actually play the game being pimped, and the less classy term "floor whore", which refers to someone pretty who is there to sell something they couldn't care less about, for money), she mentioned that she went over there to talk to the d20babes, they were all totally cool, and ALL of them were gamers.<br/><br/>So, I had to respect that. They're kinda like the Suicide Girls of gaming: They're into their games, will presumably bone up and play your game you're pimping, and so on. They seem to do it *because* it's about gaming; like, they wouldn't do the same thing for Car Shows or whatever: This is an important distinction IMO, as the girls they have at E3 and other electronic game shows are there because they were paid from their modeling agency, not because they Really Like the Conan MMO etc.<br/><br/><i>So that made me go <b>thumbs up</b> to the whole d20babes thing</i>. <br/><br/>Especially since this year Khepera had a booth babe as well, Tobi, who is a regular in Jerry's Hellas and Star Wars games. She's actually writing her own RPG which we might see in the next year or so: Called "Karma Police", <b>it's about people who shoot evil in the face</b>.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.aeforge.com/~aeon/images/origins/Images/20.jpg"/><br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_216068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/216068/#Comment_216068" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-02T14:34:59+00:00" title="July  2, 2009  2:34PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Did you guys hear about the "rent-a-girl" thing?</blockquote>\nThere is another word for this.

She was as nice and smart a player as any GM could ask for. I'm not a fan of selling from your booth with sex. But I certainly understand it's appeal. And the D20 Babes certainly are a tamer, nicer, more involved version of the standard trade show booth babes. I distinctly remember chatting with a girl at comicon and then feeling suckered when I realized that she was NOT ONE OF US. I didn't have that feeling with Danielle at all. <br/><br/>Jared, Thor and I hung out with Chris and Dan from 9th Level Games. They know how to run con events.

Significantly less RPG's to sign up for this year as well. Slightly worried about that, as there seem to be less and less representation of games I actually want to play vs. 4E. Where are all these neat new games that I want to play being run that utilize an online registration that actually functions? Gencon. I think for the first time in many many years, I'm headin there next year.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor all that bitchin though, I had a rockin time for the games I did get into and the awesome people I got to meet and game with.

No table(s), chair(s), or trash can. Everything else was there for an incredibly inflated cost. An 8ft table cost $140 to rent or only $70 if you didn\u2019t want the table skirt.

Just curious. I bet you'd get a LOT more attention for anime-inspired games, down in Hotlanta (I see an equal number of anime costumes as all other [non-Star Wars] costumes combined).<br/>----------<br/>As for booth babes, I wonder if anyone would have been offended if they wore full Victorian or Renaissance gowns, for (say) Cthulhu by Gaslight or similar game booths? What if they were in standard-issue military uniforms for a war game booth? What if in full plate mail for a Joan of Arc thing? What if in voluminous robes and cloaks, their hair in clumps and dreadlocks, portraying the three witches of MacBeth: the Bloodbath (new from White Wolf in 2010).<br/><br/>[Wow, I just wrote 2010 and I meant NEXT YEAR! Woah.]<br/><br/>The point I'm trying to make is that the "chain mail bikini" booth babe is a product of... well, the product being sold. Don't hate the player, hate the game. Don't put D20Babes out of business; ignore the games that objectify women as chain mail bikini models and thigh-clutching damsel's in distress, and patronize games with historically realistic, empowering, or just-plain-androgynous depictions? D20Babes would happily costume up as any of those listed above, I  bet; and all the ire about attractive saleswomen can just wash away.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah... and then don't buy any single clothing, cosmetic, alcoholic, automotive, appliance, etc, etc product, 'cause they all have sexy women and men pitching their shit. It's business, and it has worked in the US for a century. Don't like it? Vote with your dollar.<br/><br/>As an exotic dancer friend of mine once said, "Dude, the only ones being exploited in there are the men."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_216951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jerry%20D.%20Grayson" title="Jerry D.

I think that the economy was most noticeable at Origins.<br>\n<br>\nHighlights: Gaming with Morgan in his Swords of Mars game: finally playing 7th sea after a decade of promises; and having debates on gaming with knowledgeable folks.<br>\n<br>\nDownsides: Not managing to find Luke running anything the entire time I was there; missing out on Warhamster; and totally failing to get anyone interested enough to play Lady Blackbird with me.

It wasn't even a demo. It was a guy explaining world and system, which I already knew. But, it did two good things: a) I could nap guilt free (we caught a 6:40 am flight) and b) it clued me into the latest supplement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSpecial Vampire Unit -- totally tasteless and tons of fun<br/>\n<br/>\nLots of Call of Cthulhu, from the (almost) straightforward to the tongue thrust firmly through cheek to the romantic to the historical to the Not for the Easily Offended to the game where I will only send the quotes to them what were there because, um... We were doing our level best to be offensive.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Call of Cthulhu larp with a guillotine (cardboard blade)<br/>\n<br/>\nHollow Earth -- we were a bit, ah, opportunistic, but basically good at heart.<br/>\n<br/>\nPanty Explosion. Jury is still out on which was nastier -- the CoC game set at a prison where things went Very Wrong in all senses or the PE game where nice little Japanese girls formed a nice little band.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnknown Armies. Todd Furler just rocks, even if my neurons misfired.<br/>\n<br/>\nSotC Swords of Mars, which was an absolutely delightful game to end on on Sunday morning.<br/>\n<br/>\nI was a little better with food. I tend to overeat, which I tried to prevent by keeping my food stash off the table. I did find the ice cream place at North Market, and found three flavors that worked really well together -- spicey Thai ice cream, pistachio and honey, and dark chocolate.<br/>\n<br/>\nI bought a lot of stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI am worried that there seem to be fewer dealers selling less stuff. I am worried about fewer rpgs, particularly CoC and the interesting Indie games. It seems odd saying this, because I played in 12 events, the worst of which was merely good, and attended a 13th. I even got in a game or two of some card game or other, and we played Dominion in the airport while waiting for our plane.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had a wonderful, jam packed, fun filled Origins, at the end of which my luggage was full to capacity with plunder.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, I am still concerned about the shrinking attendance.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe con staff, I was told, was mostly new, and learning the ropes. If so, I hope next year is smoother.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh yes -- my domestic partner, Josh, took the medal for the Ice Towers competition and was a finalist in Ice House, losing by a hair to the guy generally recognized as Best Ice House Player in the World. And he told me about a 4.0 D&amp;D scenario that I think even I would have enjoyed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218357">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stigg" title="Stigg"><img alt="Stigg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stigg">Stigg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218357/#Comment_218357" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-14T20:43:59+00:00" title="July 14, 2009  8:43PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2009 6:50AM by Stigg.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't believe I forgot about SHOCK!
