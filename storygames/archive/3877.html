If you're not with me on those examples it's because you don't share my headspace. The idea is to consolidate and rewrite Attributes that are useless left overs from oWoD dogma into Attributes that may have an actual bearing on a Wraith story.<br/><br/>Secondly, if we're going with a Task based resolution system - which wouldn't bother me too much - start by dumping all Abilities and classifications and tell players to define Abilities as they wish, to fit with what their idea of their ghostly presence is. Ideally, dump Arcanoi while you're at it and make the ability to do ghostie things part of your Abilities. Instead of the "I have this-and-this Arcana (?) so I can inhabit this computer, so I roll Intelligence + Computers" crap, have an ability "Inhabit electronics".<br/><br/><b>Focus</b><br/><br/>You don't need all of Nature, Demeanor, Life, Death, Regret, Backgrounds, Passions and Fetters. You need a couple of things you can focus on. Passions and Fetters often overlap considerably - consolidate them or separate them entirely, and make the separation mean something tangible. Nature and Demeanor is a feature I really like about the ST system - the ones you pick and their interrelation say a lot about a character. "Regret" should factor into that equation, and not be a separate entity. Yeah, basically get rid of stuff, and pour the energy into Passions and Fetters instead.<br/><br/><b>Flags</b><br/><br/>Dump pre-scripted plots. Realize that everything on the (consolidated, leaner, tighter) character sheet is now a flag. The story is about those flags, and the only real adversarial power comes from the Shadow. A GM (not an ST) sets starting parameters based on the flags on the characters' sheets and then lets go - s/he plays any secondary parts that happen to arise through the story, but provides no further push or guidance other than perhaps occasional scene framing and pacing. Actually, on second thought, it'd be awesome to have the Shadow compete for scene framing rights using Angst points.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87052/#Comment_87052" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T13:46:21+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  1:46PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: AgentFresh</cite>It's shame Wraith doesn't get more love.

But the best session that I ran with it involved just one wraith.  It's the Christmas Eve after she has died, and she's hanging around her house, watching everyone.  The focus of the story:  her son is going to kill himself tonight by throwing himself onto the railroad tracks.  So she is trying to stop him, but her Shadow keeps getting in the way....<br/><br/>On the one hand, it was such a small thing.  But, at that moment, it was everything.<br/><br/>She succeeded, by the way.  And, as her son turned away from the oncoming train to walk home, he whispered, "I love you, Mom."<br/><br/>Powerful stuff.

Instead of attributes and abilities, just use the most relevant Passions or Fetters. If you're not acting on a passion or in the presence of a fetter, your ability to act is pretty much nill, but in the presence of stuff you cared about in life, acting to resolve your unfinished business, you kick ass and take names. To be fair, normal Wraith still works kind of like that, but much less so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87223">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Haakon" title="Haakon"><img alt="Haakon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Haakon">Haakon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87223/#Comment_87223" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T07:16:48+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  7:16AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm I get the idea for a shock:-like *tagonist build for Wraith where the Shadow sets each scene after the first one who establish the characters...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AgentFresh" title="AgentFresh"><img alt="AgentFresh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://jason.houseofsims.com/JM32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AgentFresh">AgentFresh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87237/#Comment_87237" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T08:07:58+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  8:07AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd be all about trying to play some sliced-and-spliced-sheet Wraith as described by 1of3.

In order to strengthen those connections/passions, you have to make contact with the Skinlands, but each time you do, you're putting those things (and your own skin) at risk.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_87247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87247/#Comment_87247" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-10T08:34:58+00:00" title="August 10, 2007  8:34AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: AgentFresh</cite>Speaking of that, have any of these "Awesome-ofy" threads ever resulted in any actual play?</blockquote>\nI don't know about other threads, but I'm watching this one for ideas, either for hacking Wraith or perhaps to be inspired to design.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87275">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Just because one GM represents the "real world" doesn't mean it's really real and just because one represents the "hidden world" doesn't mean the real one is an illusion. I'm reminded of the movie "12 Monkeys" where James Cole isn't sure if the "future" he comes from is real or a product of psychosis. That tension would be part of the fun.<br/><br/>Have we REALLY broken through to the other side or are we just all crazy?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Clyde L. Rhoer</cite>Someone go make that.
