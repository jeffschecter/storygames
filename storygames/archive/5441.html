We're going to have a pickup table with a more-or-less continuous game of In a Wicked Age. We can shuffle players and GMs between chapters, making it easy for people to join in or drop out as other tables get going and end. <br/><br/>Naturally, everybody's invited to come play some Wicked.<br/><br/>Has anyone tried something like this? Do you have any pointers?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
