My girlfriend has kindly put Led Zeppelin on while I write this.<br/><br/><b>Background</b><br/><br/>Centuries ago, the Gods of Music were cast out of Asgard. Weak and feeble, they wandered the Earth.<br/><br/>Then came electricity. Suddenly, the instruments of the Gods were empowered. Now, they're ready to force their way back to Asgard: with the power of Rock.<br/><br/><b>You will need</b><br/><br/>36 six-sided dice<br/>A stereo<br/>Lots of rock music, selected by the players<br/>A map of the world<br/><br/><b>Characters</b><br/><br/>Each player chooses five Muses: people or things which his God has lost and which he must regain to gain his power. These should be related to rock songs.<br/><br/><i>Example: As one of his Things, Blake chooses Silvana, a childhood sweetheart, who has eyes of the bluest sky and hair that reminds him of a warm, soft place, where as a child, he'd hide</i><br/><br/>Give each player a number from 1 to 6. Roll all the dice on the map. You may choose any die with your number on it as the starting location of your character.<br/><br/><b>Reclaiming Muses</b><br/><br/>In some way that I haven't thought through properly, players frame scenes where they're trying to reclaim Muses.<br/><br/><i>Example: Blake decides that his God, Strat, is in a hotel room opposite Silvana's apartment. Her window is opposite his and he watches her in the light</i><br/><br/>To resolve whether they get the Muse back, the player playing the God chooses a rock song. The player opposite him is his Judge: he picks a number, from 1 to 6, based on how difficult the thing is to get back.<br/><br/>During the vocal, the player must sing, as his God. In instrumental breaks, the player must narrate.<br/><br/><i>Example: The guitar solo instrumental starts. Dow-dee-dow-duh-DOW-nah-DOW-nah-dow-dee-dow-duh-DOW-nah-DOW-nah.<br/><br/>BLAKE: Strat stares through the window. He presses his fist against the pane, a tear running down his face, and a crack begins to form in the glass as he says<br/><br/><b>She's got a face, which it seems to me<br/>Reminds me of childhood memories<br/>When everything was as fresh as the bright blue sky</b><br/><br/>And his fist comes back and smashes the glass. As it does, her eyes meet his.<br/><br/><b>Now and then, when I see her face<br/>It takes me away to that special place<br/>And if I stayed too long<br/>I'd probably break down and cry</b><br/><br/>He reaches out his hand to her.<br/><br/><b>Oh, oh, oh, sweet child of mine.</b><br/><br/>And she reaches back.<br/><br/><b>Oh, oh, oh, oh, sweet child of mine</b></i><br/><br/>The judge adds one die to the Rock Pile every time:<br/>- The singer sounds particularly sincere<br/>- The singer sings a verse or chorus<br/>- The narration is particularly good<br/>- Another player joins in on a line of the vocal<br/><br/>He takes one die away whenever:<br/>- The singer gets the words wrong<br/>- The singer narrates when he should be singing<br/>- The singer sings when he should be narrating<br/>- Another player joins in wrongly<br/><br/>He adds three dice whenever another player successfully cuts to a scene involving his God, without changing the song.<br/><br/><i>Example: Blake has just finished the second chorus of Sweet Child Of Mine.<br/><br/>Avon: Cut to Thrash, in an airport, searching a departure board to find where his wife has gone, and he yells...<br/><br/><b>Where do we go?<br/>Where do we go now?<br/>Where do we go?</b></i><br/><br/>Either the singer or the judge may end the song, at any time. The singer gets two extra dice for ending the song early.<br/><br/>When the song ends, or is ended early, the dice in the Rock Pile are rolled. If the number of fives and sixes exceeds the number chosen by the Judge, the Muse is reclaimed.<br/><br/>-----<br/><br/>Now, this isn't quite right, really, but it stems from a desire to have some sort of Guitar Hero-like music-based resolution. Any ideas?<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce" title="MtFierce"><img alt="MtFierce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/5582955/1136400"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MtFierce">MtFierce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58557/#Comment_58557" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T15:01:46+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  3:01PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just a few immediate thoughts -- what about:\n<ul>\n<li>Points against more obscure songs or parodies?<br/></li><li>Mix CD Contributions<br/></li><li>Challenges from other players for a specific band/album/song?<br/></li><li>Points (or dice) if the lyrics are particularly appropriate?<br/></li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58568/#Comment_58568" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-01T15:59:08+00:00" title="March  1, 2007  3:59PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, I am speechless.

I love that you are using a simple mechanic and concentrating on the storytelling (or singing in this case).

If that's even possible.<br/><br/>You could start with the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=1167.15" rel="nofollow">Lesson from Chalk Outlines</a> (or perhaps Czege Principle): when one person is the author of both the character's adversity and its resolution, play isn't fun. That's a major problem. It's no fun to frame your own scene then solve it yourself. It needs someone else to frame the scene.<br/><br/><i>Blake: OK, I'd like a scene about Silvana. <br/><br/>Zen: How about we set you up in a hotel room opposite her apartment?

Very very cool though.<br/><br/>Might I suggest another approach?  Use song lyrics as Loresheet style things from WotG or Keywords from HeroQuest.<br/><br/>So I create a character called Roland, God of Keyboards.  I choose songs to be used during creation, and one of them is Welcome to the Jungle.  I can choose phrases from the song's lyrics as traits for either my character or scenes in the game:<br/><br/>For example, the first verse:<br/><br/>Welcome to the jungle<br/>We've got fun 'n' games<br/>We got everything you want<br/>Honey, we know the names<br/>We are the people that can find<br/>Whatever you may need<br/>If you got the money, honey<br/>We got your disease<br/><br/>I choose some things for the character:<br/><br/>Welcome to the jungle<br/>We've got fun 'n' games<br/>We <span style="text-decoration: underline;">got everything you want</span><br/>Honey, we know the names<br/>We are the people that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can find<br/>Whatever you may need</span><br/>If you got the money, honey<br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">We got your disease</span><br/><br/>We take these as traits and assign point to them (or something):<br/><br/><b>Roland, God Of Keyboards</b><br/><br/>Got everything you want - 2<br/>Can find whatever you may need - 4<br/>We got your disease - 2<br/><br/>We're starting to create a guy who's pretty well connected, and we've established that a disease is likely to feature somewhere in the story.<br/><br/>Another idea: The lyrics can be bought with points of some kind and injected into the story during play.  So you spend 2 points, underline "Can find whatever you may need" and add that to a scene or character or whatever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58659/#Comment_58659" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T05:01:03+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  5:01AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's a mountain of goodness here, Graham, but I agree that you couldn't play this right now.  And I have a deep bias against systems that mechanically reward "being awesome", and systems with arbitrary judging.  Unfortunately there's an obvious performance aspect that is core to this game, so I need to get over myself.  You must strut and preen and sing like a rock star, and your degree of success is inevitably tied to that.  I think I'd prefer to see it toned down to a fanmail-like system where the spotlight player is rewarded whenever the "audience" throws a goat or whoops with delight.  <br/><br/>I love the alternating between singing and narration.  Rock songs are typically built with instrumental breaks, so there's a logical space for a few choice lines every so often, which is handy.  Of course my first thought was that if the Durham3 played this, we'd need to use Neutral Milk Hotel and would thus utterly fail.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58662/#Comment_58662" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T05:36:36+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  5:36AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 2, 2007 5:36AM by Graham.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's useful stuff.

I know people have talked about them on the Forge a bit recently, particularly those two aspects, so you may want to take a quick look there to see whether they have any comments other than the kinda kneejerk "Don't do it!" you're going to get from some folks (me included, I think: I'm not sure what purpose having another player set the difficulty really has).<br/><br/>I agree with all the folks who say that it's a bit boring to frame and narrate your own story and just have everyone else act as judge as audience. I think the combination of playing to an audience and having a timer on me would drive me to plan out my scene during other players' goes, so that I wouldn't lose the narration halfway through or botch the lyrics -- there's definitely gotta be some kind of big change somewhere to get rid of some of that pressure to block your scene out in your head instead of paying attention to someone else's. I think something along the lines of Rich's idea would make this more manageable, since there'd be less mental choreography to do in your head between scenes.<br/><br/><br/>I think the coolest individual mechanic you've got going right now is the way you can pick up another player's song. Right now, that's the main way to bring people together in the game. And it feels all cinematic, too, if you cut just right. But it's also... tricky. It's a really nice payoff moment, but it seems like it's going to be quite rare in play. Any ideas on how to achieve it more often, either through the rules or player techniques?<br/><br/>Also, storming Asgard and ruling the world with Rock should definitely be cooperative somehow. Because I think that's the big capstone of the whole thing. In an idealized I-have-no-idea-what-mechanics-I-would-use-to-make-this-happen scene I have in my head, all the Gods are ascending and each is doing a short little song-monologue, but then there's a big group piece that brings it together: either this big high-energy axe-grinding rock battle in which they reclaim their thrones or a soft, loving rock ballad that tells of a reunion with their lost loves and old friends. A big, flashy, group moment, where you get to celebrate the thing that brings you all together at the table (i.e. Rock). Unfortunately, I have no idea how I'd make that happen with rules.<br/><br/><br/>Also, I'm a bit concerned about time. This seems like a sweet game for a pretty big group, and I really feel like it works best if it can be completed in one session. Say, shoot for 5-6 people being able to play it out in three hours? (This translates to about two hours for 3-4 people, I think, which is still respectable.)<br/><br/>Based on that playtime goal, five Muses per person seems a bit much. Though maybe I'm mistaken... while I think an actual song would tend to be about 3-4 minutes, there's also some scene-framing to do. I think there's going to be a lot of cheerful conversation between scenes, though, if the game is doing its job, so I figure you can say that each scene is around 10 minutes long if you count all those extra bits.<br/><br/><br/>Okay, here's an actual mechanical observation: you're doing a lot to add dice, but the success/failure check is very simple. I think here we've got some room to spice things up. I'm thinking back to, say, <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>... what if the basic success rules are the same, but you can succeed even more if you roll high enough? I don't know what those successes would represent, exactly.<br/><br/><br/>Since this is a game that engages your real-person powers but is mostly about having fun with your friends (this is how I've observed people playing <i>Guitar Hero</i>: the goal is very much to ROCK OUT rather than compete), some kind of "handicapping" is in order: the most obvious thing being, of course, would be to make lyrics sheet available, but I think you could figure out something else, too. If there's a final product, it should definitely include tips about how to choose songs if you're a beginner.<br/><br/>-- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58702/#Comment_58702" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T08:55:07+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  8:55AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>the most obvious thing being, of course, would be to make lyrics sheet available, but I think you could figure out something else, too.</blockquote>\nJust as...erm...research for Graham's idea, I was listening to 'The Immigrant Song' this morning.  From the first section alone my character had:<br/><br/>I come from the land of the ice and snow: 2<br/>Hammer of the Gods: 4<br/>Valhalla, I am coming!: 3<br/><br/>While a lyrics sheet might be useful, even better is what players <b>think</b> they heard in the song.  Because someone's going to end up with the trait:<br/><br/>S'cuze me while I kiss this guy: 4<br/><br/>Graham, I agree that trying to sing along with the song and also trying to narrate during the instrumental parts is a bit ambitious and stressful for this game.  So here's an idea:<br/><br/>What if all of the players listened to the song together and took notes.  The "lead" player created their character based on the lyrics, and the other players created ideas for a scene and possibly a conflict based on what they heard.  Perhaps the scene is directly related to the song and perhaps it is not.<br/><br/>I'm thinking about these song lyrics more like Aspects in SotC and that is what gets me excited about it.  The song is basically taken apart to use as building blocks for something else.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58708">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58708/#Comment_58708" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T09:03:09+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  9:03AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>While a lyrics sheet might be useful, even better is what players<b>think</b>they heard in the song.</blockquote>\nReminds me of the most awesome metal link I've ever been sent:<br/><br/><a href="http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoID=1168428656" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoID=1168428656</a><br/><br/><b>NSFW</b> (has rude words), needs sound.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_58711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58711/#Comment_58711" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T09:05:00+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  9:05AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, what about <b>The Sultans of Swing</b> <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_58715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/58715/#Comment_58715" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-02T09:22:04+00:00" title="March  2, 2007  9:22AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You see, the thing which fascinates me about this idea is having some sort of <i>musical</i> resolution: a bit like Guitar Hero, Dance Dance Revolution and so on.

Karaoke and Guitar Hero are not fun because they are easy, and you always hit all the notes, and you totally know all the words, and you've memorized Michael Jackson's dance moves from "Billy Jean" -- mastery and even ability are secondary at best. What's fun is you <i>get into it</i>, man -- you rock out, ham it up, start strutting around the room with your plastic guitar. You channel all the little parts of you that want to let go a little and spazz out. And that's what people appreciate, too.<br/><br/>So what if you get the words wrong? You lose a die? All it takes is a friend pitching in on the chorus and you've got that die back. Or maybe you don't, and you fail miserably -- you think being a Rock God is easy? It's based on the blues, y'know -- there's a whole lot of Sabbath between you and the promised land. So you have to cut off your narration halfway through a sentence? That's hilarious! It's called <i>suspense, man</i>. It seems to me that the Czege Principle doesn't apply when the <i>adversity</i> isn't the <i>challenge</i>. The real challenge is turning "Who Wants To Live Forever?" into a story about putting the dog down at the vet, or explaining why exactly Jamie's got a gun.<br/><br/>But I mean, come on, it doesn't take much if you want proper adversity. "Bend before the ways of heavy metal"! All you need is two boomboxes and two singers and two songs and just <i>get it on</i>. Volume up on one side, sing a verse -- volume up on the other side, sing a verse back. Both volumes up -- air guitar solo competition!<br/><br/>Seriously. I'm not saying you can't make it better -- but unplayable?

Loads of stuff to get through. Here we go.<br/><br/>Rich, I like your idea of HeroQuest-style lyric-inspired traits, but I'm really aiming at a musical resolution of some sort. Caesar, likewise: good idea about taking notes, but I really want the music to give the resolution directly.<br/><br/>Jason,\n<blockquote>There's a mountain of goodness here, Graham, but I agree that you couldn't play this right now. And I have a deep bias against systems that mechanically reward "being awesome", and systems with arbitrary judging. Unfortunately there's an obvious performance aspect that is core to this game, so I need to get over myself. You must strut and preen and sing like a rock star, and your degree of success is inevitably tied to that. I think I'd prefer to see it toned down to a fanmail-like system where the spotlight player is rewarded whenever the "audience" throws a goat or whoops with delight.</blockquote>\nHang on, hang on. Where did you get a mechanical reward for being awesome from? You get dice as follows:\n<blockquote>The judge adds one die to the Rock Pile every time:<br/>- The singer sounds particularly sincere<br/>- The singer sings a verse or chorus<br/>- The narration is particularly good<br/>- Another player joins in on a line of the vocal</blockquote>\nThe second and fourth are fairly clearly non-judgement based. The sincerity thing is a judgement, but it's not a die for being awesome. The "narration is particularly good" applies only to narration, not singing, and you'd only get it once for each bit of narration.<br/><br/>I hadn't intended anyone to strut and preen like a rock star: hence the die for sincerity. It's not about strutting, doing air guitar and being awesome: it's about performing the lyrics. Oh, well, sure, lots of the fun is seeing your friends pretend to be rock gods, but there's another level to it too.<br/><br/>Right, lots more comments to deal with shortly.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_59001">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59001/#Comment_59001" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-05T09:44:42+00:00" title="March  5, 2007  9:44AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham, looking back at your initial set of rules, it looks like you have enough material for a quick mechanical playtest or two.

Thank you. I won't have to time to reply to everything, but thanks.<br/><br/>Joshua et al, I like the ball.<br/><br/>Alex, you've got a point about the quasi-arbitary difficulty.I'd be quite happy to have, say, a set threshold of three successes; or an increasing number of successes as the game goes on; or whatever.<br/><br/>I agree that cutting in the middle of the song is to be encouraged and I also like the idea of someone challenging someone else to sing a song. <br/><br/>So how about this? The judge selects a song ("Sweet Child Of Mine"). Then, any of the other players that want to can frame themselves into scenes that'll use that song (Blake frames his character into a scene looking at his muse. Avon frames himself into a scene holding his daughter. And so on.)<br/><br/>Then it carries on as before, but cutting will be much easier, because all the other characters are set up so they can sing that song.<br/><br/>And then the last song, during which Asgard is stormed, is selected communally. I suggest "The Boys Are Back In Town". Or "Paradise City".<br/><br/>I'm rather happy with this. I wonder if it'll actually work? I may inflict it on some of the UK crowd at Spodley Grange.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_59178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon" title="Vaxalon"><img alt="Vaxalon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/42393690/1509967"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Vaxalon">Vaxalon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/59178/#Comment_59178" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-06T06:18:27+00:00" title="March  6, 2007  6:18AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I challenge someone to run this at Camp Nerdly.
