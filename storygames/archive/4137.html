Michael is a great interviewer, and though I pretty much just run off at the mouth for every question, I think there's some interesting stuff! He asked me about carry, TImestream, Game Chef, and the whole publishing thing. And keep an eye on <a href="http://merb101.livejournal.com/" rel="nofollow">Review For Initiative</a>, I'm enjoying Michael's thoughts on pretty much...everything.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
