Figure out the thing that the game does more of.  <br/>2. Think of examples of times when the prospective players already do those things.<br/>3. Bring up those incidents, and what I thought was cool about them.<br/>4. Tell them I have this game that's, like, all about that thing.<br/>5. Pitch them the game, based on that.<br/><br/>And, yeah, sometimes I feel like I'm playing dirty when I do this.  But on the occasions when they really dig the game, it's totally worth it.<br/><br/>Just thought I'd toss that out there.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_73381">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/73381/#Comment_73381" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-02T14:25:52+00:00" title="June  2, 2007  2:25PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, good technique.
