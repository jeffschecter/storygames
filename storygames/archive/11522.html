If you have a prism and a ray of sunlight, you get a rainbow, right? <br/><br/>Magic, otoh, may work only when a specific person does it. One of the requirements is the soul, or other intangible property, of the magician. In magic you don't get a rainbow with a prism and a ray of sunlight, you only get a rainbow with a prism a ray of sunlight and someone whose soul is special in this way at this moment for that reason. <br/><br/>The problem with this, aside from breaking players of the science paradigm thinking that almost all of grew up with (cause and effect and all that), is that any time you start to mechanize this process (by making mechanical rules for it) you start to take out the non-repeatability of it. Like, if you just say that the soul has to have property X and situation Y, then its starting to slide towards there hermetic style "science of the soul" where the primary difference between magic and science is simply their stance on dualism. <br/><br/>OTOH, I've always been rather unhappy with the "just make up magic as you go, its so non-predictable" solution as its... well, less than ideal as well. First, it tends to get bent towards narrative desires and tactical issues, rather than to the aesthetic sense of the magic. Second, vomit, I hate whimsy magic. <br/><br/>Anyway, that's all rambling crap. As far as the three questions, I find it hard to answer them in a generalized way. My answer to them all tends to go towards "it depends..." I mean, what I want magic to be when I'm playing a game that looks like Tolkien is different than a game that looks like Harry Potter, right? However, under all that I think there is something that I want out of magic. <br/><br/>I want magic to be an enabler. Whatever it is I'm wanting to get out of a game, I want magic to be there to smooth away the rough edges of reality that make things like that not happen. If I want an emo-romance game of true love conquering all, then I want magic to allow love to conquer in a way that it hardly ever does in the really real world. If I want a game about super powerful fascist bad-asses with the God-right of kings who shake the world when they walk, then I want magic to be the thing they do that lets them lift giant swords and swat down entire armies. When I want a game about a man dealing with love and mortality, I want magic to be the thing that lets his soul travel between the modern doctor, the futuristic space traveler, and the medieval conquistador who are all facing the same dillema so that different light can be cast on different sides of the issue.*<br/><br/>Dogs magic does this for me. Be it sorcery or priesthood, it casts the light on issues of faith, sin, healing, harm and ultimately on judgement and the things we do with the intents of our souls to other human beings. Exalted does this, where you can just wave your hand and say "I don't have to follow the rules of physics, I have essence and am chosen by god to be a semi-divine douche bag!" D&amp;D does this when I'm playing the game as a tactical combat game where magic puts funky options and allows radical alterations of the battlefield, and doesn't do it when I'm doing much else. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>*Yes, I did just finish watching The Fountain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256688/#Comment_256688" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T19:00:26+00:00" title="February 15, 2010  7:00PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2010 7:16PM by Burr.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've got two intuitions on the subject, but I'm not sure how best to connect them to get juicy implications:<br/><br/>First, magic should make each character's choices significant when the outcomes would otherwise be obscured by the choices of someone else.  It equalizes accountability.<br/><br/>Second, the focus of magic should be concrete.  E.g., how I sew my dead brother's tongue to a tree so I can ask him where my dog went, and what is the first hint of a price (if I'm naive) or expectation of a price (if I'm worldly).  <i>Not</i> how I cast a spell, recite an incantation, or whatever and suddenly I just <i>know</i>.

They're characters. They have wants and needs and don't have your best interests at heart. They might not even have <em>their own</em> best interests at heart. If it rains, it's because Tumukin, the Sky Charioteer, rode the clouds overhead. Sometimes, you can get him to come with offerings of meat and by putting your sword over the door. That usually makes him happy. But sometimes, he's away fighting a war. If you want to get him to come here to water your crops and he doesn't accept the invitation, you might have to <em>insist</em>. And I hope that works out OK for you. I bet Tumukin doesn't take kindly to being ordered around.</p>\n<p>The other way is as Jarod says: correspondence. Tongues say words. My dead brother knew this thing. Therefore his tongue can say it. This is a concrete thing that is <em>very much</em> like your brother, so it more or less acts like your brother (though your brother might be up to some important business in the afterlife, and might not want to come all the way back through the Grey Fields just to tell you about your dog).</p>\n<p>All the stuff with magic circles, words, symbols, sacrifices, that's all trying to communicate with the forces of nature. None of it is "Do X cause to achieve Y effect" any more than that's how law, diplomacy, or business deals are done.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256697">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256697/#Comment_256697" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-15T21:12:04+00:00" title="February 15, 2010  9:12PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 15, 2010 9:13PM by David_Berg.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>1.

Magic should remain a special case, so it never becomes routine.  As such, it shouldn't deform an otherwise non-magical setting except in limited, specific ways.  It might produce the occasional disaster or legendary triumph, but should stay out of daily life enough that some smart people may not believe magic exists.

When you think of "Magic" in roleplaying games in a sort of idealized way, what would it look to you?</blockquote>Magic is how you break the fundamental rules of physical reality.  Depending on what kind of game it shows up in, it might be a power tool, an artistic performance, a set of alternate rules, a homicidal liar posing as your friend, a childish whim we have outgrown, or something else.  Honestly, I don't give a shit about magic; I care about the game and the characters in it, and I'll define magic to serve those needs first and foremost.\n<blockquote>2. What are you looking for in "Magic" when it comes to creating an ambiance during play?</blockquote>\nIt depends.  I will say that I tend to dislike what's referred to above as "whimsy magic" -- if magic is in the hands of a player characters, it should be closer to magic-as-technology.  Players should know or be somehow able to define what their characters can and cannot do with magic, it should not be some artificially mysterious and unknowable quantity.  So that's an ambiance I specifically try to avoid: when I read something that spins magic as something the PCs might have but can't possibly comprehend or predict the results of, I scowl and cross big honkin' black lines through that text.  Fuck that noise.<br/><br/>Beyond that, if I can put some kind of pretty hook on what magic looks like or feels like or how it's done that really fits in with the tone of the game and the characters in it, that's awesome.  I like to be able to spool off authentic-sounding and interesting descriptions of magic off the cuff, but I don't worry too much about building the metaphysics for it behind the scenes.\n<blockquote>3. What affect on the fictional setting would "Magic" have in a perfect world for you?</blockquote>Again, it depends.  Not being all hung up on metaphysics tends to push me away from settings where magic is THE THING that everything revolves around; I'm most comfortable with magic as an alternate technology, I suppose, since it doesn't require much of anyone.  No one cares if the light in the room is from a bulb or a magically glowing orb, they just care that it turns on when you flip the switch or mutter the command word.<br/><br/>If magic's going to be more central to the game than that, then I want it to be something that the characters can push around and something that can push back at the characters.  What that means in practice is...well, it depends.  (It's hard to imagine there being any other answer than "It depends" for a question like this, at least if you're used to playing lots of different games with lots of different settings.  What's ideal for one game/setting is awful in another, and I don't believe in "a perfect world" for a game to begin with, so...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/artexercise" title="artexercise"><img alt="artexercise" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://artexercise.mygamesonline.org/graphics/Dragon_Icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/artexercise">artexercise</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256718/#Comment_256718" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T04:30:54+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  4:30AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>1. When you think of "Magic" in roleplaying games in a sort of idealized way, what would it look to you?</blockquote>\nIt looks like hollywood special effects.  It looks like magic.  Not the cheesy kind, but a combination of effects out of several movies.  A fireball isn't a word a pointy fire a bit of guano and blammo.  I think a fireball should be a loaded weapon.  The hands ignite and everyone knows what is coming.  The caster flings it out like tossing a yo-yo or a frisbee because it is that easy to him.  The hands still blaze but the spell is momentarily spent.  Summoning the dead I want to see wispy ethereal figures preluding the spell and odd symbols and what not.  But this is my idealized world.  I also want magic to fit the setting.  A setting in which circles must be used, I might expect a piece of chalk and a hurried sweating apprentice trying to pause for a second to get the mark on the wall to portal away.  Or an expert to be standing in the middle of the field and take a dancing stance and drop a foot and swirl quickly on the ground causing commotion all around him.  Magic looks like it is out of the ordinary because this is my fantasy world and I want it to stand apart.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>2. What are you looking for in "Magic" when it comes to creating an ambiance during play?</blockquote>\nIn addition to what I've written above, I generally want magic to fit one of two categories in the terms of how it should feel.  The first category is expected, it's there like how you expect that Indiana Jones not only knows how to get that whip to wrap tight around his target but that he also keeps his hat on when he swings across the chasm.  It's there and in your face and everyone has a little and knows what to generally expect.  The second category is pure mystery, when the medium does go to pull the spirits to her those around may or may not have seen it before but it feels like the first time when their skin turns cold and the smoke dances through their skin looking like imps and shadows.  Setting up the system in which runes and symbols mean as much to a spell as the words that focus it can evoke awe, wonder, and anxiety when coming across a small section of a massive spell worked area and the main caster can't place the runes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Troy_Costisick</cite>3. What affect on the fictional setting would "Magic" have in a perfect world for you?</blockquote>\nI think it's part of the puzzle for me.  Magic would be in the hands of those move the world but possibly accessible to those who are incidental via gifts and artifacts.  In a world where magic is available and depending on the cost, it may be either easily obtainable or more rare than the individuals that wield it.  Two examples here are electronics which are magical to me, I can't build a hand held freecell game but I can receive it as a gift.  The other example being more like a charlatan, that I can make a elixir that promises to cure baldness, sooth your pains, and get out your stains to make your whites whiter, but there really is only one of those hidden in a hoard guarded by a mythical beast of power.  So it depends on the game I want to play, the story I want to write.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256723/#Comment_256723" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T05:07:47+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  5:07AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite>I did this with Burning Wheel by saying, "All magic uses Circles."

We get our notions of the wonders of magic from stories; that is, from myths, books, tv shows, and movies. In almost every one of those stories, magic is used by the author as a plot device. It gets the character from A to B. Rarely does the author have the character really continue to use those magical powers to solve every situation, because authors don't have to do that. Magic is a shortcut for authors, but authors usually restrain themselves so that the magic doesn't overshadow the characters.<br/><br/>Players, on the other hand, are trying to solve game problems with the tools they have at their disposal. If those tools include some kind of magical system, they will use the spells or whatever over and over, ad nauseam, as many times as they can. Magic is a shortcut for players, but the players often equate the magic with the characters, so they feel no need to restrain themselves in using it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/No%20Love%20Orchestra" title="No Love Orchestra"><img alt="No Love Orchestra" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/No%20Love%20Orchestra">No Love Orchestra</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256776/#Comment_256776" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T10:09:45+00:00" title="February 16, 2010 10:09AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 16, 2010 10:10AM by No Love Orchestra.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like magic as a metaphor for our feeble attempts to control the unseen forces that shape our lives.

If solving a problem is the person's goal and magic works more often than anything else does, magic will be the first string response.  Two ways - at which this thread seems to be aimed - that might push magic to a second or third string response are: 1) make magic more costly and 2) make other problem solving tools more efficient.<br/><br/>While spell slots and spell points might limit the amount of magic, they still may not discourage the user to smoke 'em while they got 'em.  If you work with a negotiation system described in a few different posts above, the cost can be part of the negotiation, but that negotiation might add an unwanted break in the flow of a game.  If your group prefers a system which allows magic to be used off the cuff but still have a cost, you might use a retribution system, in which the magic user builds up some sort of karmic debt which the character will need to deal with before it becomes insurmountable.  Another thing you might try (this may sound a little gonzo, but I think it can be done sans lightheartedness) is a setting flavored system in which magic is monitored in a realm and then taxed (or ticketed if used improperly) after usage.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256790/#Comment_256790" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T10:58:56+00:00" title="February 16, 2010 10:58AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. When you think of "Magic" in roleplaying games in a sort of idealized way, what would it look to you?<br/>I like magic that's big, flashy, and in your face. I want spells that reshape the battlefield and change the fate of nations. That said, I'm fine with lesser magics too, but there needs to be some big stuff. <br/><br/>2. What are you looking for in "Magic" when it comes to creating an ambiance during play?<br/>I like magic to change the dynamics of play. I want magic to create whole new realms of possibility for a game, not just to add another character type or make some more fortunate coincidences happen.<br/><br/>3. What affect on the fictional setting would "Magic" have in a perfect world for you?<br/>If I have a setting with magic, it's going to entirely shape that setting. I'm not a fan of "like medieval Europe but with wizards". If there's magic, it's going to be central in how the entire world works and operates.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256864">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256864/#Comment_256864" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-16T16:19:38+00:00" title="February 16, 2010  4:19PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite><cite>Posted By: Adam Dray</cite>Players, on the other hand, are trying to solve game problems with the tools they have at their disposal.

Troy, I hope this is not derailing your thread to follow up.<br/><br/><br/><br/>No, of course it isn't!  Adam brings up a very good point.  And I hope we can pursue it further.  For me, FRPG magic is frustrating because it doesn't give me much chance to use my imagination.  Increasingly with DnD type games, there's no real distinction between Magic and Powers and Skills.  They're all just resources of a different sort.  For the last ten years, that's what I wanted in a magic system.  But now, I don't think I do anymore.  I play Magic: The Gathering too.  If I want tactical magic, that game is way more fun.  When it comes to an RPG, I want somehting different.  I want something that is more esoteric and imaginative.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
