I am here to talk about Lacuna. I have run it a few times so far, and I like it a lot.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere is what happened on Mission 1:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Team:<br/>\n<br/>\nAGENT SMITH: Lead agent, 46 yrs old, Force 3, Instinct 4, Access 2, Logistics, Meditation.<br/>\nMentor: Senior Instructor Snyder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAGENT PAGE: 30 yrs old, Force 2, Instinct 3, Access 4, Intuition, Meditation.<br/>\nMentor: Senior Instructor Snyder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAGENT BUTLER: 33 yrs old, Force 3, Instinct 4, Access 2, Aggression, Achievement.<br/>\nMentor: Vice-Director Forester.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Target: The assassin, Ambrose Wilkes James (if that is indeed his real name).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe team started in a hotel lobby, requisitioned equipment, and moved to the revolving restaurant above. There they located James' house.<br/>\n<br/>\nOutside the hotel, they encounter Clarence Boscow. Having no money, they barter an umbrella for a newspaper with pictures of James, his house, and car, which changes after Agent Page is done looking at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen they go to take the tram to James' house, it is full of Japanese people, so Agent Butler carves a space with his claymore. The people are torn apart like dead honeycomb. The others close their eyes and scream quietly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter the team gets off the tram, Agent Page overhears communication between James and an accomplice. They have spotted the Mystery Agents and mention a water tower. The team finds the water tower and a train station easily. Agent Butler climbs the water tower and fights with the accomplice, who bursts into flame and is rendered into ash and books. The books contain pornographic pictures of James and his accomplice.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen the team gets to James' house, they find a crowd gathered at the back of the house. One person is already dead, having been shot in the head. Agent Page requisitions a garage-door opener and finds the car inside. He shoots one of the tires out and goes upstairs. Meanwhile, shots ring out and more members of the crowd fall dead. Agent Smith spots James firing from a corner window, and uses a lasso gun to capture his rifle. Agent Page opens the back door for Agent Butler, and they proceed upstairs. When they find James, his mouth distends and a giant black centipede emerges. It crawls across the ceiling and drops down on top of them. Agent Butler pins it to the wall with his claymore, but it seizes the back of his head in vice-like claws. Agent Page succeeds in using the Lacuna device. Then all three agents eject from Blue City.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83984">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83984/#Comment_83984" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T07:13:52+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  7:13AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Team for Mission 2:<br/>\n<br/>\nAGENT PAGE: Lead agent, 30 yrs old, Force 2, Instinct 3, Access 4, Intuition, Meditation, Judge.<br/>\nMentor: Senior Instructor Snyder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAGENT SMITH: 46 yrs old, Force 3, Instinct 4, Access 2, Logistics, Meditation, Writer.<br/>\nMentor: Senior Instructor Snyder.<br/>\n<br/>\nAGENT TAYLOR: 38 yrs old, Force 3, Instinct 2, Access 4, Meditation.<br/>\nMentor: Senior Instructor Snyder.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe subject: Adam Charles Westcott.<br/>\nPrevious convictions, all between the ages of 15 and 26, for assault, aggravated assault, sexual assault, breaking and entering, and kidnapping. Recently convicted of four brutal sex-murders, resisting arrest, and the murder of one police officer.<br/>\nThe last 5 years, he was employed at a machine shop. Previous employment includes metal shop, slaughterhouse, laborer, roofer, pizza delivery driver.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is rather long:<br/>\n<br/>\nPrior to insertion, Lead Agent Page sought meetings with Vice-director Pope, seeking to clear up some possible informational SNAFUs. Vice-director Pope was unavailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe insertion point, once again, was the lobby of the hotel. The Agents began the mission by requisitioning equipment: cell phones, subway tokens, money, and a handgun. The template for the lasso gun was unavailable.<br/>\n<br/>\nUpon departing the hotel, Lead Agent Page decided to head for the newspaper kiosk, with no luck. The Agents asked a cafe patron for directions, and were directed to the subway station. At Cafe Station, they used the subway tokens to make the train appear. It was empty, and proceeded underground for two stops. At the second stop, numrous people were waiting - men and women who looked like they worked in offices. Many had newspapers. Asking for directions again leads the Agents to Clarence Boscow's newspaper kiosk.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome of these directions resulted in the Agent's divulging personal information to Personalities, which earned the group Static.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the kiosk Lead Agent Page purchases a crime magazine, and passes it to Agent Smith. Agent Smith has the Writer Technique, but no Commendation Points, so he saves the magazine. As soon as Agent Taylor opens his mouth, a nearby government building explodes. People run screaming, and Clarence Boscow packs up his kiosk and leaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt this point, the Agents go back to the subway. Once inside, a subway employee shows up and asks them to leave, as this station is being closed, because of the explosion. Lead Agent Page decides to go into the subway tunnel. The maintenance room is locked, so the Agents proceed along the tracks.<br/>\n<br/>\nA ways down, they come across the rickety shacks of subway people. Agent Smith notices movement, and follows. Inside the shack, all is dark. Agent Smith requisitions a large flashlight, and the Agents proceed down a tunnel, hewn from the earth, and emerge in a slaughterhouse. White tiles cover the floors, and cow carcasses hang from the ceiling on hooks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the corner of the room cowers a homeless man. He pleads with the Agents not to come closer, claiming it is a trap. The agents must be the ones the trap was set for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAround about this time, Agent Smith has been reading the crime magazine, which has an article on Adam Charles Westcott in it. The magazine claims he is a dangerous terrorist, having killed squatters in the subway, at another location, and that he may have an accomplice named Mulligan. Agent Smith questions the homeless man about Mulligan. At this point I passed a note to Agent Taylor's player that read: "You're real name is Mulligan." The homeless man cannot give them any more information, except that the other squatters here were killed by Westcott.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe agents discover there is another door, flanked not by cow carcasses, but the bodies of mutilated women hanging from meathooks. On the other side of the door, is an interrogation room. Only the mirrored glass is transparent, and there are no other doors.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdam Charles Westcott enters the room on the other side of the window. He is wearing a nice black suit. Agent Page orders Agent Taylor to shoot the glass (complete with a Die Hard reference!), but Agent Taylor misses the glass deliberately. Instead, he shoots the wall, which begins to bleed. Westcott acknowledges them, and produces a black file folder. Inside is a thick sheaf of papers. He holds the first page up to the agents: it is Agent Taylor's file.<br/>\n<br/>\nWestcott offers them a deal. He will give them the file, but they must meet him somewhere else - at the Pizzeria in the Factory neighborhood. Agent Page agrees, Westcott leaves, the agents leave. Fortuitously, they decide to exit the subway tunnel at a different station from where they entered (the Cafe station has been closed and locked).<br/>\n<br/>\nControl contacts the team, and notifies them that Special Agent Carter has been attempting to contact them. He wants to meet up with them, but Agent Page decides the team's priority is to meet Westcott at the Pizzeria. When Agent Carter contacts them, he warns them not to proceed. He says that the entire Factory area has been upgraded to Deep Blue, and that the Pizzeria is in fact considered Black territory. Agent Page disregards his warnings and the team proceeds.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like the work day is over as the team wanders the streets. Asking workers for directions, the team gets a rude response before contacting Control for directions. In fact, Agent Taylor requests directions, but Agent Page does not trust him, requesting directions from Control himself. The team's mentor, Senior Agent Snyder, replaces the faceless Control contact, and orders the team to stand down and cease attempting to enter the Black-level area. Agent Page breaks contact, and the team continues.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt the Pizzeria, Agent Smith goes around back, while Agent Page and Agent Taylor enter the front. As they open the door, a black car screeches to a halt, and Agent Carter leaps out, yelling at the team to stop. From the inside of the Pizzeria, no car or agent can be seen through the glass of the door and storefnt windows. The Pizzeria is empty. Until they see Westcott sitting at a table, with the black file folder in front of him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_83985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83985/#Comment_83985" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T07:15:07+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  7:15AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Westcott greets Agent Taylor. He looks at Agent Page, says "I always liked you," and hands the file folder over. The files it contains are readable by all members of the team, unlike other written material in Blue City. The file details Agent Taylor, real name Joseph Mulligan, and his criminal record. He was an accomplice of Westcott's, back in the day, but after a long prison term, he was cured by the Nasrudin Institute, just like the subjects the team deals with. He does not remember any portion of his criminal background.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen Agent Page finds his own file. His real name is Michael Corrigan, and he too was a criminal "cured" by the Lacuna device, and then recruited into the ranks of the Mystery Agents. When he is done reading, Agent Carter finally manages to open the Pizzeria door.<br/>\n<br/>\nWestcott's skin shears away to reveal the Hostile Personality underneath: a giant man with the head of a cow's skull, his body comprised of the mutilated body parts of dead women, all of it topped off with random machine parts and metal pieces. Agent Smith pins his Lacuna device to the HP, and Agent Taylor activates it***, while Agent Page wrestles the HP into submission.<br/>\n<br/>\n***Actually, this is against the rules. Oh well, I learn about a new thing I've been doing wrong each time I play this game.<br/>\n<br/>\nTheir final problem is that they cannot exit Blue City from a Black area, which means they must leave the Pizzeria, possibly even the Factory area. Out front, black cars arrive - enter the Spidermen. The team rushes out the back door. Two Spidermen are already waiting for them, guns drawn, one black car.<br/>\n<br/>\nAgent Carter starts freaking out big time. One Spiderman asks for the team's papers. Agent Page turns over the black file folder. The team notices that Agent Carter is now in the back seat of the car, pounding on the glass. Agent Page tackles the Spiderman, they fall to the ground, splashing around in about six inches of blood. The other Spiderman turns to Agent Smith and Agent Taylor and says "You can go."<br/>\n<br/>\nAgent Page manages to eject from Blue City during the fight with the Spiderman. Agent Taylor ejects after leaving the Factory area. Agent Smith, however, only has an Access of 1 (reduced from 2 due to insubordination), so Agent Taylor must eject him manually, from the real world.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I said that Westcott died on the slab, but maybe not. Agent Carter's status is classified.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll three characters write up reports that pretty much stick to the facts. Agent Page's report actually slams Agent Smith more than Agent Taylor. These reports are then swallowed by the bureaucracy machine and are never heard of again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_83986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/83986/#Comment_83986" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-30T07:17:38+00:00" title="July 30, 2007  7:17AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The actual second game was with Joe McDonald and Jackson Tegu, but they didn't play these other two games, and plus I forgot to write up an AP report afterwards.

I stole that from Judd (Paka) actually, and the text supports it. I didn't have much prepared, so I fell back on that device.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is also a product of something I have noticed so far: Not once have the players asked Control for the subject's location! They begin by investigating Blue City, and looking for stuff relating to the subject. So I decided to use an ambush, and that motif was available.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonestly, I don't think I can bring up the cured criminals situation again - I can expand on what I've got so far, but that's about it. It's also clear from the text that the Agency hires from the general public now, so they can't ALL be cured criminals.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlus, I want to introduce the difference between those cured, and those NOT cured - Agent Smith has never had the Lacuna device used on him.

I think the most interesting thing about this game is running it as <i>you</i> think it should be run: so everyone runs it differently.<br/><br/>So...Ron Edwards (from an Actual Play report) sees this game as a Le Carre-esque cold war thing. I see it as a Paranoia variant (which is a good thing). Johnstone seems to have made it a mystery game. That variation is what I like.<br/><br/>Johnstone, did you use static much? Stuff like James' phone and Taylor's file: was that part of your plan for the adventure or made up on the spur of the moment? What planning did you do before the game?<br/><br/>I'm running this on Sunday, hopefully.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_84550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blake%20T.%20Deakin" title="Blake T.

I should talk about that a little bit.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst off, it was a wee bit hard for me to remember all the things that caused static - because you make up a custom list, and I was improvising almost everything. So it was a liiiitle bit loose - I forgot to add for Techniques, I added a few points a bit late for things, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe best thing about Static was telling the players that there is Static, giving them a one-sentence description, and then tracking it right in front of them, out in the open. This is Awesome! I mark another point of Static, the players start getting paranoid, and try to figure out why they are getting more Static. I used some combination of the example Static chart and my own ideas based on the generic list. Static is the sole reason the Special Agent and the Spidermen showed up in the last adventure, also the explosion.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: planning before the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nI prepared a name a very brief background for the subject. Since the first game was entirely improvised, I just made up a name and a crime, and winged it. For the last game, I prepared a one-page dossier, with a photo, name, list of crimes, employment history, and a few comments by Cursor Mnemonic Engineering, including a disagreement over interpretation. It was pretty loose. And I had the idea of the ambush, and the file, at the back of my head.<br/>\n<br/>\nRe: I turned it into a mystery game!<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah, it IS pretty much a Rorschach test for the GM, although the players have some input too. I introduced the game like this: "It's sort of like The Cell, only instead of playing J-Lo, you play the Men in Black, and instead of going into the mind of a serial killer, you go into the collective unconscious and track his mind down."<br/>\n<br/>\nAll the people I've played with so far have been really focused on "the mission." Any inter-Agent conflict has been about who is compromising the mission, who is screwing up, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_85674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85674/#Comment_85674" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T15:58:06+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  3:58PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 5, 2007 3:58PM by Graham.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>The best thing about Static was telling the players that there is Static, giving them a one-sentence description, and then tracking it right in front of them, out in the open.</blockquote>\nIt's fascinating that you did this. I did it in a similar way: I had a glass and each token in the glass represented a point of static. Every time static went up, I added a token to the glass. Totally in the open. It really ramped up the tension.<br/><br/>The rules, on the other hand, say that the GM should track Static privately. (They don't say it like that. They say: "Control should monitor all Static levels during the mission. These levels...are freely available to all members of Control", i.e. not the players.)<br/><br/>But, I think, it's more fun in the open.<br/><br/>We played this afternoon. It went very well.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_85696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/85696/#Comment_85696" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-05T20:34:46+00:00" title="August  5, 2007  8:34PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Blake T.

My ideal Lacuna session would involve the players in an empty room by themselves, communicating with the GM through headsets. The GM could observe the players with cameras, or through a one-way mirror. As static went up, I would literally increase the amount of static in the microphone and speakers, making it increasingly difficult for the players to tell the GM what they actually want to do.<br/><br/>(Now that I think about it, this would be fairly trivial to set up at my place of work.
