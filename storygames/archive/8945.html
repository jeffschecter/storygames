I've signed up for a free membership, poked around a bit, but so far I'm nonplussed. I already use <a href="www.wikidot.com" rel="nofollow">wikidot</a> for this sort of thing, and I can't find any features particular to Obsidian Portal that distinguishes it from that general wiki site. In fact the Obsidian wiki lacks several useful features, such as being able to change the theme and add forums, which I like in wikidot.<br/><br/>Am I missing something? Anyone here experienced with Obsidian Portal who can talk it up a bit?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197588/#Comment_197588" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T11:03:04+00:00" title="March 18, 2009 11:03AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Its a easy entry wiki farm, I use it because its easy to get to, gives you access to other simular wiki's , and keeps it simple stupid. <br/><br/>If you have a wiki or wiki farm that you already enjoy there is little to no reason to use Obsidian Portal as far as I know as long as you know how to run whatever your using anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
