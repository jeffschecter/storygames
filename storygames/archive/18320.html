It is not the same thing as any and all goal-setting, intentional play; in fact, that advice is usually discussed in the context of making your play more intentioned, more focused, more achieving.<br/><br/>Thus: in most Forgean narrativist games it is definitely a good idea to have clear goals on two levels, while avoiding having goals on one specific level. To wit:<ul><li>It is a good idea to sit down at the table with a clear creative commitment and goal. For example, your shared goal as a group might be to create an unexpected, effortless and delightful tale of derring-do. This goal, by existing and being acknowledged, helps the group coordinate their actions and evaluate how useful their activity is instrumentally.</li><li>In many games of this type it is a fundamental requirement that so-called protagonist characters - often PCs - have clear, sympathetic goals they strive towards. We as players establish these goals in most games. They are not our goals, but they are goals nevertheless.</li><li>What the advice against planning and goal-setting means is that most of these games, and the creative agenda behind them, hurt badly if the players pre-plan the <i>plot</i>, the "what is going to happen" of it. A given character might think or want for a certain set of events, but the players do not - the players are there to find out what happens. By pre-planning a player is effectively plotting against the group's desire for spontaneous excitement. Pre-planning also makes them unable to utilize extremely dynamic response techniques that these games often assume; either you abandon your wrong kind of prep to play the game as intended, or you're tied down by your prep, and thus cause the game to work against its intent.</li></ul>\nHopefully that clarified something. I certainly agree with you that entirely reactive play is often very chaotic, and obtaining complex structural order requires planning at either time of play or in advance. However, it's the type of planning that matters for the purposes of determining whether it's bad planning or good planning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413158/#Comment_413158" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T23:57:30+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 11:57PM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A relevant story:<br/><br/>We are playing a Farscape game.<br/><br/>GM: "The Peacekeeper ships are guarding the area very tightly, surrounded by minefields."<br/><br/>My friend: "We should get them to be blown up by their own mines."<br/>Me: "Yeah!"<br/>My friend (high fives): "At least we have a plan."<br/>My wife (rolling eyes): "That's not a plan, that's a <i>desire.</i>"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413162/#Comment_413162" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T01:19:04+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  1:19AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've been thinking about goals a lot lately (player,group,character,party). But in regards to narrativism:<br/><br/> I was going to say Goal isn't Plot; but JDCorley summed it up nicely with: desire isn't a plan. Goals in a story are rarely achieved according to plan. I will try to be succinct:<br/>Frodo; Goal - destroy the Ring (Failed). he succumbed to the Ring at the last minute BUT if his character's Goal was listed as "bring the Ring to the Fire" then Success.<br/>Sam; Goal - aid and support his master (Success) almost to the ruin of Middle-Earth; he really should have pushed Frodo over the edge into the lava (but then Elrond should have pushed Isildur in the movie... oh well)<br/>Gollum; Goal - retrieve the Ring (Success) however fleeting.<br/><br/>The fun of a story isn't usually "will the hero make it?" but "how?" and "at what cost?". Does Anikan bring about Balance in the Force? Yeah, but only as Vader. Are you willing to be the villain to achieve your goal? <br/><br/>Elric's goals were almost always about revenge. He destroyed the world. Careful what you wish for.<br/><br/>It doesn't have to all be "evil genie granting a wish that always turns out bad". As usual in story games, it's about desire and stakes. Didn't want to slay the Queen in order to become King? Well, you'll get another shot at a throne next time, Conan.<br/><br/>It might be interesting to introduce Goals as a form of Plot Immunity; your Character can't die until you reach/attempt your stated Goal. Hell, maybe the GM is pushing for that Goal and you're all "no, no, that's cool. We'll get to it next time."<br/><br/>At any rate, I think the chaotic nature of "play to find out", "don't plan ahead" suggests a lot of interesting twists towards a goal that a planned plot couldn't anticipate. <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413166/#Comment_413166" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T03:11:15+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  3:11AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero">@Eero</a>: Yes, I agree on the different "levels" of goals and it is the goals of the PC I am talking about. I am also probably speaking about only a small part of narrativist play, one I find in systems that let me push to the max (for example <i>Polaris</i>, <i>Svart av Kval, Vit av Lust</i>, etc) for the good of my character (but maybe there is some relevance to other variants of gaming as well). In these games I will make my charaters goals my own, I will fight for him tooth and nail and never ever voluntarily put him or her in a bad spot (that is for my co-players to do) (I think also that this relates somewhat to character advocacy as discussed here <a href="http://playpassionately.wordpress.com/2008/08/18/character-advocacy-part-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://playpassionately.wordpress.com/2008/08/18/character-advocacy-part-ii/</a>). This gets me emotionaly invested in the story <i>through my character</i> (I believe that many games do it the other way around, focusing on a great story and through that getting invested in the characters populating it, does this sound reasonable?) and every hard choice makes me feel something (this is important, the focus is on the character and not on "winning" even though the two often coincide). <br/><br/>BUT when my goals are the same as my characters goals and I play to further them I will always aim for a good outcome and subconsciously make plans for how to get there.<br/><br/>I think that a similar phenomenon can be observed in playstyles that focus on creating a good story rather than specifically on the character that comes through our perception of the dramatic curve and tropes. Every action in a role playing game is the continuation of an intention and I believe that intentions are the results of scanning possible outomes. Each action is, even if it may be very short sighted, a plan. I feel that as the story progresses these plans become more and more substantial, especially if they are anticipated by the gaming group as a collective (for example "the hero will face off against his nemesis, trying to settle the score at the end of the story" that quite often comes naturally). Is this "good planning" or "bad planning"? The result of the plan is uncertain but in striving towards a confrontation one has clearly made "a plan".<br/><br/>Drawing the planning to its extreme will obviously make it destructive to any mode of gaming, even if some playstyles work better with railroading etc than others, but should the rule be "Do not make your plans too detailed" rather than "No not plan ahead"?<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">@JDCorley</a>: Exactly, but drawing a line between the two can be very hard, especially when you yourself is working towards a goal (the good of my character, a cool story, etc). <br/><br/><br/>Or am I completely wrong here?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_413167">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413167/#Comment_413167" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T03:21:46+00:00" title="April 30, 2013  3:21AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/biffboff">@biffboff</a>: Yes, but the chaotic nature of play is in my eyes the result of loosely made "plans" or "desires" of the participants colliding, not the absence of planning.

Polaris, for example, was mentioned - you can plan to your heart's content, but <i>actually</i> the only thing that matters for your character's story is your decision over what they want, and perhaps the most generic description of how they'll go about it. You don't get bonus success for good planning, except perhaps on the theory that the Mistaken will let you go easier if they fall in love with your narration - but that's just good narration, not good planning.<br/><br/>This puts planning vs. advocating to a strong contrast: many of these games are intensely interested in hearing you tell us what your characters wants, why (psychological motivations), and what they're willing to do to get there. Meanwhile the game will often just have other players nod along as you speculate about the plan, but there is no step in the play process where your plan is evaluated for effectiveness. It's all just descriptive color, like Star Trek: it simply does not matter whether their plan for "recalibrating the engine core by reversing polarity" or whatever is a good one, the important thing is to show how diligent and brave these officers are in the execution of their duties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413204">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413204/#Comment_413204" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-30T11:31:56+00:00" title="April 30, 2013 11:31AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Insofar as this is relevant to Narrativism:<br/><br/>It's good - essential, even! - for characters to have goals.

When I play I use different levels of distance to my character depending on the game. At one end of the spectrum we have the helicopter perspective where I focus on the story as a whole and my investment in the characters come through the story. In that style of play my player goals will differ greatly from those of my characters' and often they are best expressed on the meta level, for example: I want to explore the relationships in this group of people through the lens of a dramatic arc".<br/><br/>As the level of distance decreases my personal goals will get more and more aligned. This style of play doesnt hold together in some games that break easily under player preassure but many systems support this. <br/><br/>What then is the purpose of aligning player and character goals? For me this provides the possibility of playing honestly and fighting for my characters goals is a good way to bleed.

I recently played a game in which I lost. Not just, "oh, well, the bad guys got away." No. I lost. Humiliating defeat. I had to struggle with that, I admit, because I really like it when things work out for the heroes of the story. This time it didn't and I, through my character, had to deal with it. <br/><br/>Talk about character depth! I wouldn't want to repeat the experience often, but the thing about having goals and making plans towards achieving those goals is that one needs to deal with things when they go awry. That can bring colors to the character and the story that would never be "discovered" with constant victory. <br/><br/>I think that role-playing has that element of acting: the more we identify with the character, the more powerful the experience will be. That's what I'm going for. I like fun, light games, but I love it when the game takes on a meaning that really brings the people around the table into the story. I think that having goals that are familiar, and acting on them, makes that more likely to happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414588">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414588/#Comment_414588" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T02:24:09+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  2:24AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2013 2:58AM by RasmusL.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/JoshDemers">@JoshDemers</a>: Yes, this is exactly what I am talking about where defeat hurts me on a personal level, thats when I am the most honest to my character in play.<br/><br/>Do you (the forum) have any suggestions on games that do not break under this kind of preassure?

I know that a goal is what lies at the end of the plan but I can see only a blurred distinction between the two.<br/><br/>A plan will be more detailed than a goal but in reality I believe that we will mentally flesh out a plan with that we expect to lead up to it. For example "being the king" will most likely follow from "becoming the king" and this in turn will probably be connected by a coronation which in turn will be the result of the position of "king" being vacant and the character made an eligible (in the fiction or dramaturgy or system or what have you) candidate for taking that position. Thus "becoming" in itself is a plan through association. <br/><br/>How we will arrive at the goal the end of our plan-arc is unclear at the start but as we draw closer and closer to it i believe the room of percieved (not real) possibilities narrows. I would hypothesize that this has to with our perception of the dramatic arc, culture and other experiences. Thus I believe that a goal is by neccesity connected to a plan as soon as our minds grasp the contents of the goal.<br/><br/>That is how I look at the concept of a "plan" and why I have a problem with the wording of "don't plan ahead". I understand that I should not lay out a detailed schedule for in-game events but planing without drawing on the extremes I see no problem with.

This means that the premise of your question is incomprehensible - a straw man, if you will. The answer is that no, nobody advices against planning in that sense of the word, so there is no contradiction between planning and having a goal.<br/><br/>What we usually mean when we discuss how planning ahead can be harmful to playing is <i>prescriptive, authorial expectations</i> that players develop regarding future events of play: the problem is not that your character wants to be the king, or that you figure out what needs to happen for that come to pass; the problem is when you grow angry at another player whose legitimate game actions ruin your plan, or you break the game's rules to make your plan come to pass. As you can see, it's not planning really that has a problematic reputation in certain types of rpg modeling - it's the associated motivations and techniques that players historically attach to the mental activity of planning.<br/><br/>In other words: plan all you want, as long as you accept that the game you're playing might not give any weight to your plans, even if you are the GM. Some games are designed to ignore pre-planning specifically to pre-empt the authorial expectations that so commonly come hand in hand with plans. It's a strategy for shaking roleplayers out of their routine modes of thinking, if you will.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414612/#Comment_414612" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-23T09:50:30+00:00" title="May 23, 2013  9:50AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2013 9:55AM by RasmusL.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Prescriptive, authorial expectations", I like that and it solves this problem for me. <br/><br/>Have I understood you correctly if the following is what I think the answer to my question is?:"The problem lies not in the planning itself but in some of the consequences of planning.

This meshes well with the system of play and the way the group is playing it, and there's nothing wrong with it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, it would be pretty weird to go into the game with the "plan" that you want to see your character defeated and captured by a particular group of "bad guys". This would work well as a character's goal (the way we're using the word in this dicussion), but not too well as a plan put together by the player. (The game will almost certainly be more functional if the player, just like everyone else, is invested in finding out whether the plan works or not.)<br/><br/>In the weird middle ground might be something like: "I plan for my D&amp;D paladin to level up to level 6, and then switch to the anti-paladin class for the multi-attack bonus." This has strong "story" ramifications--a paladin turning evil--but if the game is all about the combat challenge, this story element is just a fun bit of colour added to the game we're playing.<br/><br/>On the other hand, playing a straight-up Narrativist game focused on difficult moral decisions (even if it's the same D&amp;D), you probably won't get the most out of it if you go into it with the idea that after three sessions, your character will turn evil. You're working against what the group has agreed to play.<br/><br/>I think it depends on how your "goals" and "plans" interact with the nature of the game you're playing and the creative direction of the group. For instance, I'm playing a Diplomacy game right now, with some light roleplaying elements. Although we do associate personalities and bits of story colour with our "characters", we're playing to compete with each other on a strategic battlefield. In this game, having an in-character goal (like "I will capture Berlin, no matter what I have to give up to do it, because my grandmother was tortured there!") will ruin the game, whereas a player's plan for how things will go ("I need to move two units into the Atlantic by 1906, or else Joe will not be able to pull off his Lepanto maneuver") is exactly what's needed.<br/><br/>So the key is aligning these decisions with the creative direction of the group in the game you're playing.<br/><br/>Some "goals" and "plans" will work towards the purpose of the game you're playing; some against it. If you're playing to find out how the story turns out, a player plan ("My rival will return to tempt me in season three!") takes away from the group's ability to spontaneously create story. If you're playing to re-create a familiar H.P. Lovecraft-type story, then having a player goal like "I hope my cultist goes completely nuts by the end of this one-shot, and I'll push towards that" might be totally the thing you need to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414793">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL" title="RasmusL"><img alt="RasmusL" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RasmusL">RasmusL</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414793/#Comment_414793" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T14:19:07+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  2:19PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting thoughts yes. When I play the way I prefer to play  I will never make plans that are contrary to my characters plans (e.g. Getting captured or turning evil) because that feels like betraying my character and creates unwanted emotional distance.<br/><br/>Thinking about this lead to the following idea:<br/><br/>Is the relationship between the scope of the plan and the plans of the character an important factor in distinguishing between good and bad planning? E.g. "Will be captured by crooks" is a plan that is outside of my characters reach and will (greatly in the hands of the kidnapers and also unwanted), "becoming king of the north" is for my character to strive for and even though other characters are likely to be involved the agenda is my characters', not external. Planning stuff within your characters' agenda-space and confining my expectations to the actions of my character, not others, is, I believe, a good way to avoid "bad planning" wether I advocate my characters plans and goals in full or not.<br/><br/>I want to bleed and distancing mysekf frim my characters' goals does not achieve this, when I am aming fir emotion and not intellectual analysis I feel that I profit from "being me" ("play close to home", isn't that some jeepgorm saying?). <br/><br/>I believe scope and expectations on external forces are important factors. Planning within the reach of my character I see no problem with as long as I keep the plan diegetic and do not expand it to a real life agenda of tricking my co-players.<br/><br/>"Do not plan the actions of others"?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414804/#Comment_414804" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-27T18:24:41+00:00" title="May 27, 2013  6:24PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yep, you've got it.<br/><br/>You know, a lot of those bad trad texts talk about how important it is not to metagame, to always think from the POV of your character. I disagree, of course: players do need to be able to meaningfully manipulate the system, and in that sense you'll be thinking somewhat out of character\u2014but you should only do so in order to further your character's agenda or to deepen your portrayal of your character. (In a well-designed game, skillful manipulation of the system <i>is</i> "good roleplaying.") So being trained to always think from your character's POV is a useful skill to have.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
