It has fewer publishers listed, and it is far less thick than the version I bought in Canada. Is this some strange European edition? Or have they released a second version everywhere? If this version has not been released in Canada/USA, I might buy it, otherwise I can wait until I get home.<br/><br/>If somebody can tell me within the next day or two, that would be awesome.

The resulting quality was really terrible and, for that reason and others, Wildfire <a href="http://www.cthulhutech.com/2008/07/08/cthulhutech-changes-publishers/" rel="nofollow">left Mongoose and started publishing Cthulhutech through Catalyst Game Labs</a> (who also do Shadowrun).  The new version you saw is probably the new printing done through them, but I haven't seen the new one yet, so I'm not sure.<br/><br/>I was fairly interested in the game before the horrible printing disaster and, even now, the mechanics don't excite me that much, but I'd definitely give it another look now that the books won't fall apart in your hands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212228/#Comment_212228" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-14T13:21:31+00:00" title="June 14, 2009  1:21PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, the books I saw look the same as the pictures from their website.
