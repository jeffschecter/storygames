I'd played before, in my back garden. It was good enough to make me play again, but didn't really click.<br/><br/>This game, though, was my best game of the convention. The guy running the game (well, hosting, since it's GMless) had prepared some mix CDs in advance. He had good taste in music and they worked well. We played in his lodge (Conception has little lodges, which you stay in), sitting in sofas and drinking tea. I think that was essential.<br/><br/>There was me, the guy and two women. We decided quickly that we'd be 30-somethings, leaving our jobs and driving through the States. Someone suggested the Grand Canyon as a destination. When I heard this, I virtually insisted on driving down the West Coast. We ended up starting in Canada and driving down. I greatly enjoyed describing bits of the scenery.<br/><br/>So, one of the women chose "Fall madly in love" as a Future. I had "Drink myself senseless" and something else as mine. Host guy (I feel bad I can't remember his name, because he was nice) had something to do with music as his. I played a gay character, mainly, I think, to escape the obvious pairing up of two women and two men.<br/><br/>It was a beautiful game. The characters (as created from listening to songs) and the Futures drove it. I'm convinced that the way to play Ribbon Drive is by not worrying about adversity. Just play a group of people, interact, and don't worry about resolving storylines. Also, keep moving. Even if you feel you have a storyline hanging, abandon it and move to the next location.<br/><br/>Oh, hey, and framing scenes in turn worked beautifully, even though the two women weren't used to indie games at all.<br/><br/>There were some wonderful scenes. The Fall Madly In Love character hit on the hotel night manager while drunk. He wasn't interested. My character then followed after him and hit on him too, but wimped out just as they might have arranged a date. (At this point, the two women opposite explained to me I'd missed an obvious chance to drop a hint I had free time later. Hence, Ribbon Drive teaches me how to ask girls out.)<br/><br/>We didn't introduce Obstacles, really, nor take a Detour: certainly, we never changed the CDs, except when they run out. I suspect Detours are something of a red herring: the game isn't really about introducing obstacles. It's much more freeform than that.<br/><br/>At one point, the woman playing Fall Madly In Love Girl said how happy she was. She said there was nowhere she'd rather be, at that moment, than playing the game.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254596">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254596/#Comment_254596" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T16:55:29+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  4:55PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Just play a group of people, interact, and don't worry about resolving storylines.</blockquote>\nInsert a bunch of pluses here.

Several of my favourite sessions have had 1-4 Obstacles introduced.<br/>They're much more common in the more madcap, crazy-chase-movie type of story, though...<br/><br/>Considering that, I'm always delightfully surprised how often people choose to Detour as a response to an Obstacle, instead of actually resolving it.<br/>Even with Traits active, a lot of the time people will say "You know what? I'd rather Detour than fix this situation, even though I could."<br/>Neat! That's the kind of behavior that isn't rewarded, celebrated or even allowable in a lot of games.<br/><br/>So, yeah... when obstacles are presented, the choice that emerges is "do we want to deal with this?" and not "how do we deal with this?"<br/>However, obstacles aren't the "point" of the game, you're absolutely right. It's about Futures, and people, and conversations, and letting go of stuff.<br/><br/>I don't like to describe the game as freeform, because it isn't... it's mechanically driven. Just, not by obstacles.<br/>By Futures.<br/>Futures give you a hard mechanical choice: "Accomplish this and don't become the protagonist. Give up on this and become the protagonist. Don't choose until it feels honest."<br/>That's the engine behind the game. Conversations and arguments and scenery-chewing and self-reflection are the fuel.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu" title="jackson_tegu"><img alt="jackson_tegu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.consumating.com/photos/10478/large/146737.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jackson_tegu">jackson_tegu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254621/#Comment_254621" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-02T18:42:54+00:00" title="February  2, 2010  6:42PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            jackson tegu <span style="color: #0099FF;">likes</span> this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254674">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254674/#Comment_254674" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T02:41:02+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  2:41AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: joepub</cite>I don't like to describe the game as freeform, because it isn't... it's mechanically driven.

Not freeform at all.<br/><br/>On a forum like this, where we're used to thinking of <i>system</i> as <i>mechanics</i>, it sounds bad to say we didn't use that conflict resolution mechanic. After all, that must mean we didn't use the system, right? But we did use the system, as defined by the Futures and the music. And it worked beautifully.<br/><br/>Thanks, Joe. It was a superb game.<br/><br/>Jackson! We listened to your song and liked it.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254679/#Comment_254679" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-03T03:28:18+00:00" title="February  3, 2010  3:28AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 3, 2010 5:30AM by GB_Steve.">edited February 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I probably enjoyed the game of RB we played more than you did but it was certainly true that we weren't all singing from the same hymn sheet, our 'what do we do' was more mechanically than story focussed, but even so, I thought the game had some very good parts, like when people left the band, the hair-dresser or the accident.
