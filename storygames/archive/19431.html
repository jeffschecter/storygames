I wasn't an early adopter, so lets say I've been doing it for a few years on various sites.<br/><br/>Like all things, PbP are cyclical in nature. Certain times of the day there's more chance of activity, certain days of the week (assuming relative geographical proximity), and certain times of the year (summer and winter breaks often sees posts dwindle or posters vanish). But whatever.<br/><br/>I'm curious about something else I'm noticing lately. It's probably always been there, but I'm just catching on (yeah, I'm slow sometimes). Especially in the realm of PbP...<br/><br/>So what is it with players who want crunch for crunch's sake?<br/><br/>What I mean is: Players who insist on crunchier games for no discernible reason. All other things being equal, especially in a PbP environment, you'd think that players would push for rules-lighter games rather than their crunchier cousins. It's really hard to compare apples to apples on things like this, I know. But there's a distinct advantage that's recently come to us that allows GMs to study this phenomenon.<br/><br/>Fate Core and Fate Accelerated (FAE).<br/><br/>These two games are basically the same foundation expressed slightly differently. They use fudge dice, use aspects, fate points, fate point economy, stress, consequences. Fate. But these two games are slightly different. If you're not familiar: Core uses two stress and consequence tracks as well as a list of 18-some skills that cover what the character can do; FAE however, uses one stress and consequence track as well as a list of 6 approaches that cover how the character does things. That's it. That's the difference between the two...<br/><br/>Except the page count. Core: 310-pages; FAE: 50-pages. And what's in that 260-pages of difference? Crunch. In the form of examples, subsystems, extras, more examples... <br/><br/>Yet, for the life of me, I can't seem to find many FAE games across my sites of choice, yet Core games are flourishing, comparatively. The count is 21 to 10, in Core's favor. Genres are across the board, which is to be expected for a "generic" system, but they tend toward fantasy. Of course.<br/><br/>So has anyone else noticed this odd trend? I'm sure people have. I've just never been able to compare this so directly before. It's still weird to me though.<br/><br/>Second question, I guess. Anyone know of any PbP sites where FAE games are common / flourishing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir" title="AlbeyAmakiir"><img alt="AlbeyAmakiir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/139/nCE1BSIBJZEBM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AlbeyAmakiir">AlbeyAmakiir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432490/#Comment_432490" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T00:13:51+00:00" title="May 13, 2014 12:13AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I browsed an RPG shop the other day. They had Fate and FAE. I couldn't tell that they had slightly different rules. I also couldn't tell that the rest was useless crunch. Instead, I'm not sure what I thought. The name (Core) implied to me it was the minimum required (I had assumed it was around longer than any of the games based on it, but the person in the store informed me otherwise). Thus, it would stand to reason that FAE would be heavily simplified, to the point of being a different game. Look how much smaller it is! Effectively, this meant that "Core version", in this case, sounded synonymous to "right version".<br/><br/>That probably has something to do with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432492/#Comment_432492" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T01:37:24+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  1:37AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FAE and Fate Core are not much different, aside from the skill system.<br/>The FAE booklet is stripped down to the absolute essentials. It's great to get people on-board with a one-shot and also, character creation is very fast because you don't have to come up with a skill pyramid.<br/><br/>But for running a longer game, Fate Core is really the basis. It's a complete system covering character development, game devlopment, GM advice, how to expand &amp; tweak the system etc. <br/><br/>But practically, don't worry about it too much. You can switch from FAE to Fate Core pretty easily (also from Fate Core to FAE, I guess). <br/>In my experience, players insist on playing Fate Core (instead of FAE) not mainly because it's crunchier but because the skill system looks more <i>familiar</i> to "classic RPGs" they are used to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432517/#Comment_432517" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T08:35:38+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  8:35AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">@BeePeeGee</a>, that's not entirely accurate. There are advancement rules in FAE, which are nearly identical to Core, save the use of Approaches over Skills. And there's nothing to stop the GM from using the game development, GM advice, etc from Core when running a FAE game. Which is partially my point.<br/><br/>Everything on the players' side of things exists and is complete in FAE (with the two differences of Approaches over Skills and one stress/consequence track instead of two). So why do players insist on the crunchier system?<br/><br/>The Fate Toolkit introduced lots more subsystems and rules options for Core. Included in those were the options of using a single stress track and FAE style Approaches instead of Skills. If a crafty GM were to offer to run a Fate Core game with Approaches instead of Skills and a single stress track, they would get more interest than if they offered to run a FAE game. Yet, those two games would be functionally the same thing (as far as the players' interaction with the rules are concerned). <br/><br/>So again, what's up with players opting for crunchier but otherwise functionally identical games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Veav" title="Veav"><img alt="Veav" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/007/n3BMK8VFYEJK8.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Veav">Veav</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432518/#Comment_432518" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T08:54:45+00:00" title="May 13, 2014  8:54AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is Express cheaper?

It's a roleplaying game, not a puzzle. I shouldn't have to solve the puzzle before I can play the game. Rather, the complexity of the puzzle is key. A 50-piece puzzle with clearly distinct pieces vs a 5000-piece puzzle with nearly identical piece even a computer can't solve in a month.<br/><br/>I bought a roleplaying game, not a puzzle. I want to use that RPG to tell stories with some friends, I don't want to sit around trying to solve an overly complicated puzzle <i>before</i> I can tell stories with some friends. It's that whole line about rules systems getting out of the way. Some structure and rules that everyone agrees to so we know what we're getting in to before sitting down, sure, but something complicated enough that you have to study it, or master it just to get it to perform its basic function (to facilitate telling stories with friends), hell no.\n<blockquote>It might feel good to be the master of an elaborate structure but I'm looking at the pile of parts and the blindfold and I'm wondering whether I'm trying to beat the game, or beat the <i>developer</i>.  What will all this offer that a two-page John Harper special can't give me?</blockquote>\nExactly.<br/><br/>I know the devs are smart. I know that other gamers are smart. But there really does seem to be this elitist undercurrent to some gamers. "What? You're not playing System X? It's <i>too complicated</i>? Hur dur. You're just not smart enough to figure it out. Good. I didn't want any dummies at my table anyway."<br/><br/>It's almost like a math equation is the password at the clubhouse door.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432529/#Comment_432529" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-13T10:48:51+00:00" title="May 13, 2014 10:48AM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's not fair.

If that's what people like, enjoy. It is a completely separate thing to enjoy a style of game than being a dick about enjoying a style of game. I wasn't trying to conflate the two.<br/><br/>Different games are inherently different beasts. Which is why it's been so hard to directly compare lighter games to crunchier games. Until now.<br/><br/>Mechanics make a difference, granted. (If that's a contentious remark then that's definitely a whole new thread.)<br/><br/>Typically, different games are so mechanically difference that a direct comparison is impossible. With how similar Core and FAE are, I think that direct comparison is not only possible, but downright simple to do.<br/><br/>Of the two mechanical differences between them, number of stress/consequence tracks and skills vs approaches, the stress/consequences one is easier to dismiss. There's a fair amount of discussion lately on G+ about abandoning the second track even in Core games as most gamers don't seem to see the need for it. In case you're unfamiliar: Core uses a physical and mental stress/consequence track, whereas FAE uses a single stress/consequence track for everything.<br/><br/>Which leaves skills vs approaches. Since mechanics do make a difference, and the difference between these designs is not insignificant (the skills and related stunts section of Core is almost as many pages long as the entirety of FAE), what does that really mean in play? Or, how does that affect play and the stories that emerge?<br/><br/>With Approaches you have six universal personality/how you go about things traits which cover basically everything. There's some discussion of hitting a particular approach too often, say always going with your highest, or trying to, and feeling punished if you can't. But, you're also covering the vast range of possible actions across many/most genres with a short and simple list. Approaches are doing some heavy lifting by being personality markers along with covering the same ground as skills. This works really well for games where the skill sets of the PCs would have significant overlap, bringing character distinction in the form of personality. Also, this universality permits off-the-wall games, say a premise that's unusual, say investment banking. Forceful, Clever, etc can all still be used just as well.<br/><br/>With Skills you have eighteen specific areas of expertise that determine what you can do. To be fair, these are somewhat generic skills that are basically meant to cover most situations that would come up, but leeway is explicitly given to modify or add to this list when necessary. But, that's an inherent danger of this design... blind spots. Or design blindness or whatever it's called around here. And almost having to hack the system before you can use it. This works really well for games where the characters are distinct based on their individual skill sets, but is somewhat diminished in the most popular action-adventure genres as most characters would default to the same baseline capacity of kicking ass, thus eliminating a fair amount of that distinction. For our investment banking example, not only would most of the skills simply never come up, but a whole new set of skills and related stunts would need to be designed just to attempt such a game. <br/><br/>I'm not saying one is right and the other wrong. Just stating my preference and wondering why the general push of gamers seems to tend toward heavier systems when all other things are equal. Core and FAE are so fundamentally similar that they can be compared apples to apples. And yeah, a bit of cursory poking around suggests that Core is something like 2x as popular as FAE. <br/><br/>So maybe it's just me being confused by the whole thing, but I still don't really get it. Two games that are practically identical mechanically, yet one is a lot more popular than the other. Some of the things mentioned by others up thread are marketing, branding, and tradition.<br/><br/>EDIT: <a href="/forums/profile/James_Stuart">@James_Stuart</a>, I've been reading through some of those and I gotta say it's having the opposite affect on me.

The issue is that, while FAE and Core have similar core mechanics, they are very different games on their feet. I think liblarva is underestimating the differences, and misidentifying a preference for the things Core does well (customization, granularity, extras, variety) with a preference for how Core does those things (by being slightly more mechanically complex). <br/><br/>By saying that Core's added complexity is "crunch for crunch's sake" the implication is that the crunch level is the only difference. That's simply not the case. <br/><br/>slipped<br/><br/>I think crunch level by itself is kind of a red herring. Rather I think there's a balance between how much a system accomplishes and how much crunch it needs to get their. A game that was very crunchy but doesn't accomplish much is a different beast than a game with the same level of crunch that provides substantial rewards for using the system. <br/><br/>Take Fate and FAE as an example. FAE is a great rules light system. Core adds just a little more mechanical complexity and leverages that complexity to enable a lot of variation in game play. We're not talking about crunch for crunch's sake. The crunch here has a purpose.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432689">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf" title="Zachary_Wolf"><img alt="Zachary_Wolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/037/n1VRIZE40I10A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zachary_Wolf">Zachary_Wolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432689/#Comment_432689" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T14:08:53+00:00" title="May 15, 2014  2:08PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Quick two cents: I think some people value crunch over narrative depth because focusing on numbers and strategy is easier and "less nerdy" than role-playing and coming up with creative ideas.

Fate Core gives plenty of nudges towards exploring the Fate Fractal in depth. FAE has no mentions of it, and doesn't encourage it. Fate strongly pushes a GM in the direction of "when you include magic in your game, maybe you should figure out what kind of system you'd like for that, here's 3 good examples we've come up with". FAE doesn't suggest you should come up with a system at all and strongly leans: "make it an aspect or stunt, and move on".<br/><br/>The "how do you roll dice and get a number" part is pretty minor to the differences between Mindjammer and a FAE Space Opera game.  Resolution mechanics alone don't make how a player interacts with the game.<br/><br/>So as I think a bunch of people are saying, Fate Core vs FAE makes a really poor place to explore crunch for crunch's sake. It might be a good place to talk about the difference between systems (not rules)-light vs systems-medium, but I'd back away strongly from "systems for systems sake" being a good description of that.

Fate Core gives plenty of nudges towards exploring the <b>Fate Fractal in depth</b>. FAE has no mentions of it, and doesn't encourage it. Fate strongly pushes a GM in the direction of "when you include magic in your game, maybe <b>you should figure out what kind of system</b> you'd like for that, <b>here's 3 good examples</b> we've come up with". FAE doesn't suggest you should come up with a system at all and strongly leans: "make it an aspect or stunt, and move on".</blockquote>\nSo the non-mechanical differences between Core and FAE is that Core includes a bunch of extra mechanics and spends word count suggesting you use them? <br/><br/>Core is very much written in the vein of a framework, a design kit, for GMs and players to bash together to get what they want, but that's all mechanical. FAE doesn't have that (or it's simply a refined build based on that DIY design ethic, the designers have just already done it for you). But that's still quite solidly mechanical differences. "Here's some more mechanical stuff, you should use it" is still mechanical differences.\n<blockquote>The "how do you roll dice and get a number" part is pretty minor to the differences between Mindjammer and a FAE Space Opera game.  Resolution mechanics alone don't make how a player interacts with the game.</blockquote>\nAfter a fashion, yeah. But even if you played Mindjammer using FAE, it would feel different. Why? The Mechanics. All those pre-built stunts, power systems, sleeving mechanics, almost all boil down to some form of task resolution bonus, tweak, or modifier. Yes, the games play differently at the table. Absolutely. But it's still mechanics. The use of this mechanic makes this game feel differently in play that that game which doesn't use this same mechanic.\n<blockquote>But I feel like this is a futile argument at this point, and I wonder if this thread is going to go anywhere?</blockquote>\nConsidering the circular argument I'd say not very likely it's going anywhere at all.\n<blockquote>(To bring up a gentle meta point: this also reminds me a bit of the Storium thread, where you asked a few times for people to talk about why Storium was different, and after they did, were then were like: 'But that's not a meaningful difference at all from play-by-forum games!

Maybe I'm just weird, but I don't find "it is 'cause it is" a compelling argument, any more than I find a list of mechanical stuff as the answer to "So, what non-mechanical differences are there?" a useful contribution to a conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/liblarva" title="liblarva"><img alt="liblarva" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/liblarva">liblarva</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432696/#Comment_432696" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T15:53:41+00:00" title="May 15, 2014  3:53PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>And I don't mean any of that in a very negative way: sometimes, there's just no common point for discussion in a particular approach.

Did (does) anyone reading this use the "Weapons vs Armor Types" table. Briefly, it was a table adding a modifier to attack based on what weapon you were using against which armor type. I never met anyone who regularly did and only <i>once</i> online did I hear of someone who claimed they did. Even when official modules/supplements introduced a new weapon, it rarely made mention of this table. I  would call this Crunch for Crunch sake, I think. <br/><br/>Now for the opposite: natural 20's. They weren't in the rule books we used but we (and everyone in our small circles) recognized the natural 20 as deserving of further math. The formulas were usual different from group to group but it always adjusted the numbers further. This was math we could get on board with!<br/><br/>Maybe some people simply assume Crunch is in the rules for a reason and use them without question; maybe there IS a reason even if it doesn't compel every player; maybe it's a question for the designers of Crunchy games: "What purpose does this table/chart/additional math serve?"<br/><br/>Eventually the question boils down to: "Why doesn't everybody like the things that I like?"<br/><br/>If we're lucky, we'll find people to play with who don't use the "Weapons vs Armor Types" table and recognize that a Natural 20 adds something to the equation (both figuratively and literally).<br/>Crunch where it's warranted.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_432699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AsIf" title="AsIf"><img alt="AsIf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/228/nAGHQTW523VF0.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AsIf">AsIf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432699/#Comment_432699" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T16:56:29+00:00" title="May 15, 2014  4:56PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Mush (or whatever the opposite is).</blockquote> I think those who use the word "crunch" in a pejorative sense would say that the opposite is "flow".<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_432700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/biffboff" title="biffboff"><img alt="biffboff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/189/nI5NYQDMCBCPG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/biffboff">biffboff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/432700/#Comment_432700" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-05-15T17:12:52+00:00" title="May 15, 2014  5:12PM">May 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm aware of the use of Crunch, especially in RPG reviews but is Flow a term people actually use?

The word "flow" is used in game design theory, by researchers etc, and can refer to many types of games besides RPGs.  Whereas the word "crunch" (as far as I know)* is mostly used by RPGers themselves, typically to describe system mechanics which involve the use of numbers and math.  <br/><br/>* I'm not opposed to crunchiness, it depends on the game's design goals.

There are several other mechanical differences (stress tracks, extras, the way stunts are constructed and applied, the care and feeding of invokes and compels).

Answer: Because in Core you have skills that only do certain actions in certain situations and a good chunk of stunts simply swap one skill for another in a certain circumstance, or add a new action to the skill. Which are both utterly useless in FAE. So yeah, skill swap stunts and and "adding an action" stunts don't exist in FAE. But why? Skills vs Approaches. What remains are functionally identical between the two systems.<br/><br/>Invokes are identical in both, simply reordered and reworded, specifically passive opposition is 3rd on the FAE list instead of 4th on the Core list. Pass a benefit to an ally is 4th in FAE, 3rd in Core. Event and Decision compels are present in both, though the phrasing might be different. And yes, extras are absent from FAE. The very name of the optional subsystem might shed some light as to why. These are not vast differences between the systems. Again, it comes back to more mechanics in Core than FAE. Not wildly different, say the difference between MHR and D&amp;D. These are two nearly identical FATE builds. You can rail against the facts of the system all you'd like, <a href="/forums/profile/Crunch">@Crunch</a>, but it's all there in black &amp; white. And frankly, I'm done with this clearly pointless bickering.<br/><br/>I'm not arguing that they play differently. Clearly they do. I'm simply laying that squarely at the feet of the minimal mechanical differences between the two, and asking why players seem to prefer the crunchier option? Players prefer Core to FAE. Fine. Why? They play differently at the table. Fine. Why? The mechanical differences. Fine, but. They're not all that different. They are different, yes.

It's not about the crunch, it's about the capability. That capability has a lot to do with the mechanical differences between the systems. Like it or not Core has a more robust framework to hang modifications on, and the process of personalizing a Core game is very much about interacting with systems like Extras. <br/> </div>\n<div
