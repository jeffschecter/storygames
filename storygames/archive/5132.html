The date is February 23, 2008.  This will be a roleplaying and boardgaming event.  The long-term goal is to try to develop a group similar to nerdNYC.  We'll see if the area can support a group like that, but, in the meantime, we'll have fun gaming with each other!<br/><br/>For more information, and to begin preparing for the con, please go to <a href="http://www.goplaypeoria.com" rel="nofollow">Go Play Peoria</a>.  I'll also answer questions here.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snikle" title="snikle"><img alt="snikle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snikle">snikle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125071/#Comment_125071" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-07T21:44:53+00:00" title="February  7, 2008  9:44PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn!

My plan is to do minicons on a quarterly basis until it catches on or we get tired of doing it.  So, hopefully, this will be the start of a beautiful thing.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
