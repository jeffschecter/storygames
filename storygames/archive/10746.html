It's been a really long time since I've dropped in to S-G, but I had an idea just now that I hoped some of the smart people here might be able to help me with.<br/>I've been running a World of Darkness game for the last few months, and it's been interesting.  Reminding me of both what I like and dislike about that setting and system, but that's not really the point right now.  The two PCs started as mortal hunters and were just recently captured by a True Fae and hauled off to Arcadia.  Last Friday we turned their characters into changelings and I started to introduce them to some of the new concepts in Changeling and talk a little bit about where we'd pick up with their characters.  I'd been planning on picking up right after they escape from Arcadia and stumble back into the mortal world, bloody and weary after their flight through the Hedge.<br/><br/>But today I had an idea.  I thought it might be interesting to play out, in some way, their Durance in Arcadia.  And I thought it might be possible and interesting to do this by taking a break from the nWoD system and playing a game of My Life with Master.<br/><br/>So, what do people think?  Can MLwM work with this sort of setting and premise?  It sounds to me like it might work, though I can think of a few possible problems as well.  One problem that comes to my mind immediately is that MLwM is normally supposed to be in a setting with normal humans around who are under the sway of the Master, oppressed by their Fear, right?  I'm not entirely sure how I'd do that in this case.  Possibly the Fae Master rules over a section of the Hedge and the humans are replaced with hobgoblins, but hobs aren't usually all that sympathetic.  They tend to be rather monstrous and alien in their own right, so this sounds like a bad idea.  But maybe this Fae (who I had, incidentally, set up as a mad scientist/doctor sort even before this idea came to me) is able to establish temporary but stable connections with the human world in order to find people to "work" on and "help."<br/><br/>Another, probably bigger problem is this: though I don't have my copy of MLwM with me and it's been awhile since I've read it, I think one of the possible endings for a minion is suicide?  This would need to be avoided, obviously, as would any other possible endings that result in the death of a PC, since that would make it rather hard to continue their story afterwards.  Would MLwM fail if those endings had to be taken off the table?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
