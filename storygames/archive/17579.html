I got into board games in a big way a few years ago, and wrote off RPGs as too much work for too little reward. Recently, I did some cursory research on improv acting, and discovered RPGs weren't working for me because I was playing wrong! Over the years, I had come to realize results were better when I let my players have influence over the game, but I still spent a lot of time negating when their ideas seemed inappropriate, or when I just thought they were lame. So I conducted an experiment. I got ahold of my son, and proposed a storytelling game. The only rules were that you couldn't say no to the other person's input, and whenever you said something, it had to add something to the story. It worked like a charm. So I am looking at integrating improv concepts into my RPG playing.<br/><br/>I'm not interested so much in improv acting as improv storytelling, though. It seems like it would be fun to stay in author stance most of the time, like when I'm telling stories to my kids. The main thing, though, is having a good play experience without having to do prep work. If you have been down a similar path already, your advice and recommendations are welcome!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_398521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/398521/#Comment_398521" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-11-23T13:48:09+00:00" title="November 23, 2012  1:48PM">November 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2012 1:48PM by David_Berg.">edited November 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there,<br/><br/>Are you looking more for "try this technique" suggestions, "try this game" recommendations, or both?<br/><br/>Do you have any particular preference for a division of roles?

When I encountered jeepform, and friends who practiced improv, it made me all kinds of excited about new directions rpg could take. Play with Intent (linked to above) has some of those thoughts. Having the storyline that is normal to rp stabilized improv acting, to my mind. Gives you a known line of narrative to follow, and made it more accessible to folks less experienced (like me!). Improv folks are amazing! But it's nice to have some ground rules and share understanding of story to help guide a group to be able to craft a tale together.

As far as "rules about who gets to talk when", <i>Penny for my Thoughts</i> has some great ones!  big_buddha, you play a character who's in the process of remembering what you've done, but you can only go so far before the rules tell you to ask two other players what you did next.  There are no dice, the progress mechanics are really simple (basically, sometimes you earn pennies), and although I personally prefer to act scenes out, there's no reason you couldn't just stay in author stance the whole time.<br/><br/>Another fun option is <i>Swords Without Master</i>, which gives you different constraints on what you can narrate depending on what kind of scene you're in, plus a die roll for input into the scene's tone.  The whole thing plays out by passing the talking stick (the dice, actually) from GM to players, between players, and from players to GM.<br/><br/>Another technique you might enjoy is something I learned from <a href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2009/07/04/archipelago-ii/" rel="nofollow">Archipelago II</a>, which is giving authority over certain parts of the fiction to certain players (so if your son claimed "the oceans", then whenever the story moved to the oceans, you'd have to ask him what's there).

Also checking out Giving and Taking on that site ... looks like it's focused on acting, but that might not be bad. Also, Fluffy Bunny ... interesting game mechanics. Hearkens back to Yoda: do or do not, there is no try.<br/><br/>Anyway, A Penny for my Thoughts looks very promising. And I'm going to check out Impro to broaden my horizons. Thanks everyone, you've been quite helpful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
