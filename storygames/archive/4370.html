But to be honest, I never really thought roleplaying the Revolutionary War would be very fun, and I wasn't digging the steampunk aesthetic that was attached to it.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to this past weekend and I'm laying on the couch reading my printed out playtest copy and going F- YEAH!  This ROCKS!<br/><br/>Joshua, your game may still be in playtest, but it reads <b>great</b> and I'm really looking forward to playing it.  The content creation tool is brilliant, I love all the patriots and tories you added, and I'm really glad you added in a Versus Mode.  It reminds me in some small way of a Duel of Wits in BWR which is a high complement).<br/><br/>Even the techy possibilities are taking me over.  <i>I wanna drop artillery shells over the British lines with a remote-controlled balloon.  I wanna send guys in diving bells from my steam-powered submarine to blow up the British flagship.  I wanna watch Ben Franklin hack a telescope and some dangerous chemicals into a surveillance camera to catch Tory spies.</i><br/><br/>Damn you Joshua!!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_98801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/98801/#Comment_98801" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-24T18:14:52+00:00" title="September 24, 2007  6:14PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Caesar_X</cite>Damn you Joshua!!</blockquote>\nAw, thanks! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Opportune Objective <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> completed, now moving on to the next objective...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
