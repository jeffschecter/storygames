I'm much more of a rules-light person, so classic over advanced or newer versions--however some iterations like Castles and Crusades can work for me.<br/><br/>What I want to do is base the system around a character's six ability scores instead of the the ability modifiers. I don't really care about backward compatibility, so whatever gets ditched is not an issue for me.<br/><br/>* Classic six ability scores ranging from 3-18<br/>* Roll high (d20) add ability score. Meet or beat target number to succeed<br/>* Class is similar to careers in Barbarians of Lemuria (no skills, but you can have broad talents or moves)<br/>* Six Saving Throws tied to each class for reactive checks<br/>* Hit Points represent actual "hits" you can take before CON damage occurs<br/>* Ability damage (scores can be temp. reduced from different types of attacks) <br/>* Danger Die (to be explained in further detail) which ratchets up tension/excitement<br/>* AC as either "ability challenge" in non-combat and AC as armor class in a fight<br/><br/>The target number in an ability challenge is your opponent's ability score + level (or HD). So you want to sneak past the guard, you've got a DEX of 10. The guard is level 5 and has a WIS of 8. So the AC is 13. Roll d20 and add your ability score, if it is a 13 or higher you succeed.<br/><br/>For combat, the AC is armor type (ascending 1-10) + DEX (or perhaps DEX+WIS / 2). Let's say the guard notices you and pulls a sword. The guard has 5 for amor and a DEX of 11, to the AC is a 16. Roll d20 and add your ability score, if it is a 16 or higher you succeed.<br/><br/>Thought for saving throws is I could use ability modifiers + level. I'd have six saving throw categories which tied to your class. If you are a 6th level Thief and have a DEX of 16. Roll a d20 and add +8 (level+mod), if your score matches or beats the ST number then you succeed. The nice thing about this is I don't need to have a sliding Saving Throw scale. Each class has a different set of numbers for Saves. <br/><br/>For advancement I'd go with 20th level as the top. You can increase 6 ability points over 18 levels as you progress. No ability score can be higher than an 18.<br/><br/>You can raise your ability score by one point upon reaching:<br/><br/>LVL 3 <br/>LVL 6<br/>LVL 9<br/>LVL 12<br/>LVL 15<br/>LVL 18<br/><br/>I also like HP represented as "hits" which is the number you can take before damage occurs. So a fighter with 7 HP can be hit seven times before damage is taken. HP covers, flesh wounds, weariness, morale etc. Once you are at zero, then damage reduces your CON score. Reach 0 CON and save vs death. <br/><br/>As you advance, each level gives you +1 HP. So at level two the fighter can take 8 hits. At level nine the fighter can take 15 hits.<br/><br/>With regard to magical weapons, a +2 sword doesn't give you a bonus to your roll, it gives you 2 extra hits if your roll is successful. So if you were fighting a Goblin with 3 HP, you would need to hit it three times before it takes damage. However with a +2 Sword you could immediately cause damage.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of skills and would probably use something along the lines of careers or talents (much more broad-based) which covers multiple class actions. However, not sure how to implement this into the mechanic. You could go with a bonus, a die step, or reduce the TN. Not sure which one works best.<br/><br/>The Danger Die is a risk that the player can take to increase rewards. For example, a fighter is striking at a dragon, but want to cause extra damage. He takes a d6 as his Danger Die and rolls it with his d20. The d6 number is reduced from result. If successful, the die can be used along with standard weapon to increase damage. You can save the die for later, for give it to someone else to use on their turn. If you fail however, the DM gets to keep it and use it against you.<br/><br/>I'd love to get some feedback from you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424116">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424116/#Comment_424116" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T02:14:49+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  2:14AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Looking for some assistance.<br/>The target number in an ability challenge is your opponent's ability score + level (or HD).

I mean, what's your baseline success rate for an "equal" challenge?<br/><br/>Your base mechanism here is rolling 1d20+ability vs. ability+"something". It's easy to simplify out the ability score and see that we're actually looking at "1d20 vs. something", with that "something" ruling the general percentage of success.<br/><br/>Your to-hit rules as written imply that an "average" attacker is going to hit an "average" defender with "average" armor 75% of the times. If you want that to be 50%, though, it's very easy to fix: just increase the value of all armor types by a constant 5, so that we're looking at a 6-15 range, an unarmored human being armor=5.<br/><br/>For non-combat challenges, though, your "something" there is the opponent's <b>level</b>. Which means that - ability scores being equal - the chance of <i>failing</i> at a task is (opponent's level)*5%. I'm not sure that's what you want, or is it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424118/#Comment_424118" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T03:33:06+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  3:33AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the quick response!<br/><br/>Ability score + Opponent Level (without any situational modifiers is what you are trying to match or beat. <br/><br/>The average ability score is 11.

Does it read any better?<br/><br/><br/>RULES SUMMARY<br/><br/>When you try to overcome an obstacle and the outcome is uncertain, you roll dice. There are several types of dice that this game will use, these are:<br/><br/>d4\t\td6\t\td8\t\td10\t\td12\t\td20\t<br/><br/>For most rolls you\u2019ll see the equation d20+DEX, which means rolling a twenty-sided die and adding your ability score (in this case Dexterity) to the result.<br/><br/>You will do this whenever you attempt something and a roll is required. If the total is the same as the task\u2019s difficulty number or higher, then you succeed. Rolling a natural 20 is always a success, while rolling a natural 1 is always a failure.<br/><br/>This roll-high method is used throughout play, though there are some subtle alterations to the resolution.<br/><br/>To Hit. Whenever you want to attack an opponent, roll a d20 and add either your STR or DEX (depending on the weapon) score. If the result is less than the target\u2019s Armor Class, the attack misses. AC is determined by adding DEX+WIS+Armor Type (the better the armor, the higher the number).<br/><br/>To Act. When you want to attempt something risky, roll a d20 and add your appropriate ability score. The target number for your ability challenge is determined by difficulty. If you roll less than the DC, then you fail.<br/><br/>To Save. When you need to react in a dangerous situation, you will need to roll a d20 and add your Level to try and save yourself. This applies to things such as spells, poison, falling, traps and death. The difficulty for each type of Saving Throw is determined by your class. If you succeed, you escape the effect.<br/><br/>These rolls can be affected by Adds: numbers that are added to the d20 or the difficulty. Here are some of the things which can impact a roll.<br/><br/>Ability Bonuses. For each one of your abilities, you can have a positive or negative modifier. This bonus will be applied when you need to roll a Saving Throw.<br/><br/>Class Dice. You get an extra die if there is a class-related talent or move you can use. Roll the die along with the d20+Ability score and add it to the result. The better you get at a talent or move, the higher the die you get to use.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424134/#Comment_424134" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T08:28:41+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  8:28AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It reads pretty clearly.  I love your Danger Die mechanic.<br/><br/>The premise of d20+ATTR is clean, but the handling time on the math is harder with larger numbers. Quick, what's 19+17?<br/><br/>Can you accomplish the same thing with lower numbers? D20-based games (the die, not the OGL) tend to be swingy, and a 5% increment between successive numbers isn't very meaningful. In fact, a lot of modern d20 rules give a +2 as the stock bonus, suggesting that a d10 might have served the game better. Also, the single-die roll is linear. <br/><br/>Sticking to a 3-18 range is nostalgic for a lot of gamers, so I get why you might want to do it. But consider using the modifiers as the actual score. Attributes are rated from -3 to +3. You roll 2d6+ATTR. Typical target is a 7+, hard target is a 10+. A +1 or -1 is a significant modifier.<br/><br/>Your Danger Die mechanic becomes, "Take a -1 or -2 to hit, and gain a +1 or +2 to damage, respectively." Simplified and elegant. The handling time on the math is super fast.<br/><br/>(Check out the game Dungeon World for examples of this working really well.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424143/#Comment_424143" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-13T09:30:40+00:00" title="November 13, 2013  9:30AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Adam, Thanks for the feedback.<br/><br/>Yes I want to keep the score rather than the modifier.

For monsters, HD = Hits. HP = CON. So a Goblin (assuming 1 HD) will only take 1 hit before the next shot goes to damage.<br/><br/>I didn't put in Adds for the example with the guard. For example, the task becomes difficult if say the area is well-lit and the guard is alert. Maybe that bumps up the number by +5 so instead of needing a 13 you need an 18.<br/><br/>As you level up, you get talents. Sneak for instance. This can give you a class die which you get to roll along with the d20. A class talent starts at d4, but as you progress you can bump it up to d6, d8, d10, d12, even d20 at very high level. I think this will offset the opponent level issue you've got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424432/#Comment_424432" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-19T07:16:17+00:00" title="November 19, 2013  7:16AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your ability roll has another property which you may (or may not) see as a feature, which is that most of the likelihood of success at higher DC's comes from the dice roll rather than the ability.

You also get the Adds die as well for some rolls.<br/><br/>Now I could offset somewhat this using the advantage/disadvantage option in the D&amp;D Next Playtest. If you have an advantage you roll 2d20 and keep the highest.<br/><br/>Assume you need to roll an 11 to succeed. With a straight d20, you have a 50% chance of success. With advantage, this goes up to 75%. That\u2019s the equivalent of a +5 bonus to the roll, since you would also have a 75% chance of success if you only needed a 6 or better on a single d20.<br/><br/>On the flip side for the target of 11, disadvantage means you only have a 25% chance of success, equivalent to a -5 penalty to the roll (when you need a 16 or better on a d20, you also have a 25% chance of success).<br/><br/>you need a 15 on the die to succeed. With a single d20, you\u2019ll only get this 30% of the time. With advantage, you\u2019ll get it 51% of the time \u2013 about the same as you would get an 11 or better on a single d20. So advantage in this case is worth about a +4. Disadvantage, similarly, is about a -4: You only succeed 9% of the time with disadvantage, which is about the same as a single d20 with a target of 19.<br/><br/>At the extremes, advantage makes the least difference. If you need a natural 20 to hit, that\u2019s only going to happen 5% of the time normally. Advantage ups your chance to 9.75% \u2013 equivalent to getting a +1. Disadvantage takes you chance down to 0.25%, or 1 in 400. <br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://onlinedungeonmaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Advantage_Disadvantage_Probabilities.png"/><br/><br/>So the question is if implemented, how it will fit within the design?<br/><br/>Ability Score + d20 for normal actions.<br/>Ability Score + 2d20 for Class actions.<br/>Ability Score + Pd20 for hindered (untrained?) actions.<br/><br/>What counts as a Class action?

Building bonuses like what you were talking about with class talents into the advancement structure of the class reduces build time, and centers focus on how the character is built but rather on how the character is played.

I'm contemplating just player rolls and nothing for the DM.<br/><br/>I think I can distill this down to ability score, class, and level. <br/><br/>The base DC is 20. Add your ability score to the d20 roll VS DC 20. <br/> <br/>Character's with a 10 in their ability are required to roll a 10. <br/> <br/>Characters with a 18 need only not roll a 1. <br/><br/>Skills are your class (like in Barebones Fantasy).  If you are using your class, you get advantage 2d20kH.<br/><br/>Proficiencies become your level bonus (+1 to +6). Any time it applies you get the level bonus.<br/><br/>For contested maybe go with opponent Ability Score (and perhaps + for level) as a DC, which could eliminate more rolls on the DM side.<br/><br/>Danger die is the wild card in this one. <br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424687/#Comment_424687" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-23T15:20:07+00:00" title="November 23, 2013  3:20PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 23, 2013 3:22PM by vgunn.">edited November 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I'll riff off of Hituro and recommend his route rather than using Talents or a similar mechanic to add to what would be Skills in other systems.

Characters feel more active.<br/>- a granulated surprise mechanic - you have different amount of options depending on whether the stealthyOrc gives a warcry first, has to move out of the shadows, or just backstabs you.<br/>- CHA is not a dump stat in conflict anymore. Tyrion Lannister is now a great playable option. Your most effective enemy could be the Talker. <br/>- play becomes qualitively-different to other old school games but more effectively models cinematic swashbuckling (Westley in The Princess Bride persuading The Prince he cannot move).<br/>- Being able to pass on the success of the Danger Die works well with this system e.g My rousing oration made the Fighter driven to hit harder, my warning added to the other character's ability to dive out of the way of the charging horse.<br/><br/>When you have two player characters doing the same thing, who goes first, is it the highest ability (in non-fighting) or the highest level (in Combat, although you could use the Hits idea here). Or do you just roll to succeed with the winner going first ?                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424760/#Comment_424760" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-25T04:25:28+00:00" title="November 25, 2013  4:25AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote> When you have two player characters doing the same thing, who goes first, is it the highest ability (in non-fighting) or the highest level (in Combat, although you could use the Hits idea here).

If they are both talkers, then I would probably just go with just the roll--and take the highest score (assuming both succeed). Or you go highest ability score depending on the type of action. If it is Talker then highest CHA &gt; Mover it is highest DEX &gt; Doer highest WIS/INT &gt; Fighter highest STR/CON.<br/><br/><br/><br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_425158">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425158/#Comment_425158" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-03T17:26:23+00:00" title="December  3, 2013  5:26PM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<img alt="image" src="http://imageshack.us/a/img202/8011/g85y.jpg"/><br/><br/>Well, I get to play-test this out tomorrow night--so I'm pretty excited. <br/><br/>RULES SUMMARY<br/><br/>When you try to overcome an obstacle and the outcome is uncertain, you roll dice. For most rolls you\u2019ll see the equation d20+DEX, which means rolling a twenty-sided die and adding your ability score (in this case Dexterity) to the result.<br/><br/>You will do this whenever you attempt something and a roll is required. If the total is the same as the task\u2019s difficulty number or higher, then you succeed. Rolling a natural 20 is always a success, while rolling a natural 1 is always a failure. This roll-high method is used throughout play, though there are some subtle alterations to the resolution.<br/><br/>To Hit. Whenever you want to attack an opponent, roll a d20 and add either your STR or DEX (depending on the weapon) score. If the result is less than the target\u2019s Armor Class, the attack misses. AC is determined by adding DEX+WIS+Armor Type (the better the armor, the higher the number). For certain attacks, your class can give you an advantage. With this advantage you'll get to roll 2d20 and keep the highest die. Level and Adds and also boost the result.<br/><br/>To Act. When you want to attempt something risky, roll a d20 and add your appropriate ability score. The target number for your ability challenge is determined by difficulty. If you roll less than the DC, then you fail. For certain actions, your class can give you an advantage. With this advantage you'll get to roll 2d20 and keep the highest die. Level and Adds and also boost the result.<br/><br/>To Save. When you need to react in a dangerous situation, you will need to roll a d20 and add your ability score to try and save yourself. For certain saves your class and level can boost the result. This applies to things such as spells, poison, falling, traps and death. You'll need to roll a 20 or higher to make a successful saving throw. If you succeed, you escape the effect.<br/><br/>Rolls can be affected by Adds: numbers that are added to the d20 or the difficulty. <br/><br/>Level Bonuses. You'll get a bonus as you advance upward in your class. These bonuses can be used in certain situations to help increase your result.<br/><br/>Class Dice. You get an extra d20 if there is a class-related talent or move you can use. Roll 2d20 and keep the highest die. <br/><br/>You can ratchet up the excitement by using a Danger Die. The Danger Die is a risk that the player can take to increase rewards. For example, a fighter is striking at a dragon, but want to cause extra damage. He takes a d6 as his Danger Die and rolls it with his d20. The d6 number is reduced from result. If successful, the die can be used along with standard weapon to increase damage. You can save the die for later, for give it to someone else to use on their turn. If you fail however, the DM gets to keep it and use it against you. You can only keep one Danger Die at a time and use it once per session--so choose the situation wisely.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_425193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/425193/#Comment_425193" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-12-04T08:05:35+00:00" title="December  4, 2013  8:05AM">December 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, that list of dangers under Saving Throws says more about your game than anything else does, and it's amazing.
