                            Yeah, Spycraft is pretty hot and Cthulhutech might be cool.  It's mainly their attitude about "these indy publishers" that gets me.  I mean, I've been saying for a while now that there are opportunities for mass-market publishers to make creator-owned games imprints, similar to Vertigo at DC Comics (though their comics are not usually creator-owned).  But Mongoose would not have been the publisher I would have expected to bite this particular bullet and it looks like that they have something completely different in mind.                        </div>

                            I'm amused by the (totally unintentional) subtext of the name.  Mongooses kill cobras.

JBR makes a good point.  At least Mongoose is trying to integrate this new RPG movement into its business.  I have to give them a lot of credit for sticking their necks out and trying to invest capital in Indie (Indy) RPGs.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/><br/>-Troy                        </div>

                            Whoa, now I suspect folks are giving Mongoose too much credit.  Comparing Flaming Cobra to New Style is comparing apples to oranges.  New Style put out exciting, left-field games that probably wouldn't have been published otherwise. Flaming Cobra is putting out print editions of products that already have a track record or significant following.  It's cool and all, I guess, but not too terribly risky, I don't think, and not really with the spirit of exploration and innovation that New Style had.                        </div>

On many levels my response to the idea that they're not taking a very risky stance is "Good!"  I'd rather they came looking for profit from the indie sector and said "Well, look ... there's some modest, but low-risk profit to be made.  Cool!" than that they risked all and lost all.  To the extent that other people are watching how Flaming Cobra works out, I'd personally be glad if the lesson they took away was "Oh, there's a measurable market here after all."                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>To be fair, Vincent turned them down.<br/><br/></blockquote>
Vincent's decision was valid, but I can see Mongoose being a good home for indie publishers' back catalogue.<br/><br/>Vincent could hand them Dogs-- with the expectation that they'd keep selling about as many copies as when<br/>it was the main game he was promoting solo--  and then focus his own attention on selling Mechaton and designing whatever comes after that.<br/><br/>Afterward, he could hand them Mechaton and promote his next-thing, and design his next-next thing.<br/><br/>And by then the Dogs deal would expire and revert entirely back to him... or be renewed if he was happy with their results.<br/><br/><br/><br/>For an indie designer with only one game and plenty of ability to promote it, Mongoose makes less sense.  <br/><br/>But if you're more prolific as a designer than as a self-promoter... Mongoose might make sense.                        </div>

                            Um, what?  I bet selling Dogs through Mongoose would make Vincent a lot less money.  A LOT less, even if he was selling 50% more copies than he does now (which I kinda doubt would happen).  First of all, Mongoose would take a cut.  Second of all, the distributors would take a cut.  That's partially why indie publishing works, because you don't have to pay several more middle men.                        </div>

The hard part's over.  The game's edited, playtested and written.<br/><br/>Now all the game designer, indie RPG self-publisher has to do is make sure it doesn't go out of print and answer questions online.  This isn't exactly digging ditches, here.                        </div>

                            You know, in that Forge thread I saw a lot of good points and good speculation -- but there was one question I never saw an actual answer to in the context of the burning serpent: Is the license exclusive? <br/><br/>Could Vincent have kept selling Dogs on his own in addition to Mongoose selling the 8.5x11 version, or would he have to stop selling his own for as long as they were distributing it? (Or would there be other restrictions on where and what he could/could not sell while under contract with them?) <br/><br/>Because that's a really fucking key point, and I didn't see an actual answer to it. If anyone else does, please point me to what I missed.<br/><br/>Also, did anyone ever get any hard figures on the "after they make back their initial investment" part? Because everyone assumed the 50/50 split -- but didn't ask a lot of questions about how many copies would have to sell before Vincent got a dime.                        </div>

Let him sell his own version, too. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In the Forge thread, Vincent doubted that Mongoose would have let him continue to sell his own version of the game.  But I wonder if that's true.<br/>No way to know, unless he asked.<br/><br/>What if they let him keep selling his dinky version with the flimsy cover and old rules?

Trying to earn decent money from mainstream publishers would definitely be Vincent's problem. Being a freelancer in traditional RPG publishing is almost as insane as being a standard-distro publisher.<br/><br/>I have a pretty low opinion of Mongoose, so I'm happy to see Vincent pass on the deal.                        </div>

I've just never been a big fan of their products. I find their graphic design really hard to stomach, and I feel they are more interested in churning out quantity over quality.<br/><br/>I was also a participant in the playtest of their version of <i>RuneQuest</i>, and it was just disastrous. Their acquisition of RQ is a really sad thing, IMO. 12 books in 7 months... they just keep pooping them out.<br/><br/>However, I have heard they deal very fairly with freelancers, though, IIRC, their rates are low, even by RPG standards. Someone feel to correct me on this if I'm wrong.                        </div>

Which is why I found out they'd accepted one of my submissions when I saw the finished book for sale in a shop, thought "huh, someone else must have had the same idea" before discovering it had my name in it! Sure, they paid me when I asked them, but they didn't exactly volunteer that information ... But then, I might be the exception rather than the rule, I wouldn't like to judge beyond my own experiences.                        </div>

Vincent's decision was valid, but I can see Mongoose being a good home for indie publishers' back catalogue.<br/><br/><br/>There's a fallacy here, which is that Vincent does any work at all regarding Dogs.<br/><br/>Here's what I do regarding Polaris: I answer questions in my forum once every week or so (which is kinda fun, particularly the hard questions).  I answer fanmail (a pure joy.)  I call Collective Copies and have them print more copies to send to Indie Press Revolution once every three months or so, which takes about five minutes of my time.  I cash the checks that I get from IPR.<br/><br/>Of these, the hardest part is *by far* cashing the check.<br/><br/>Vincent does less work than I do in promoting his game, in that he has other people to answer most questions in his forum.<br/><br/>Tell me again what a major company could actually do for me?<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Mark, in Mongoose's defense, Paranoia XP was excellent. (Of course, I gather they're taking that back in-house now and away from Allen Varney, so we'll see how it progresses).<br/><br/>Nobody's leapt in to defend Curly, here, so could I just point out that it sounds entirely sensible? If ever a game designer:<br/><br/>a. Didn't want to do the work of promoting his product or<br/>b. Found sales were falling to a level where a final push, from a bigger company, seemed worthwhile<br/><br/>then Mongoosing it up might be an option. Of course, I haven't published anything, so what the hell do I know? But it sounds sensible.<br/><br/>My instant thought is that, if I were Mongoose, I'd be making offers for games like Scarlet Wake. And perhaps Criminal Element. In other words, not established games: but games which are great, and grabby, and which, for one reason or another, haven't developed to their full sales potential.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

I'm a fan of Conan too, and of Slaine.<br/><br/>One thing's for sure - Mongoose can't be accused of being afraid to try out different things (big licenses, minis games, boxed set rpgs), and that's no bad thing, whatever my personal views of them. Flaming Cobra is illustrative of that.                        </div>

<br/>
Me too. Panty Explosion sells whether I'm activly promoting it or not. It tends to sell a little better when I'm talking about it and generating interest, but it also sells in the months where I'm not. It's been like that from day one. I do wish I could promote the book more. I like going to cons and showing my game to people. I just on't really have the time.<br/>
<br/>
For the amount of books Mongoose hopes to sell i couldn't see the deal being worthwhile (I think I said something similar in te original Forge thread). Like Ben said, I can't imagine what a publisher would do for me that would warrent 50-75% of the profit that I'm not easily doing already. Recently a very nice Spanish publisher contacted me about publishing a Spanish translation of Panty explosion. matt and I have been considering translating the book for awhile, so we we're eager to hear his deal. In the end the amount of copies he hoped to sell and the percentage he could afford to give us were just to small. We could pretty easily put together our own Spanish language product, and even selling just 10% of what he hoped to sell, would make more money. Now it would be different if Mongoose (or another company) could feasibly plan to sell 10-30,000 copies of a book. That would be way more worthwhile. But selling 1000 (and that number sems optomistic considering that many Mongoose books sell less)? The money coming back to you is barely going to be worth the trouble. And if you don't maintain full rights? If they want to change the product in a way you don't approve of? If they want exclusive rights for a set amount of time? Again, not worth the trouble. For me anyway. For someone else maybe this is the perfect deal.<br/>

                            I've had the translation issue (and turning a translation down) as well.<br/>
<br/>
The way I think of it is (roughly) this:  Someone comes up to me saying "I can help your book reach new consumers."  That is almost certainly true.  I don't think they're lying to me.  The question is "Can you help my book reach <b>enough</b> new consumers to pay for having a whole 'nother person drawing profit from the same customer-base"?<br/>
<br/>
IPR, as a for-instance, <b>can</b>.  My intuition (backed with facts and math that are real, but so dodgy that I refuse to share them!) is that if I went to selling the books directly, I would lose more gross profit than the margin that IPR charges me.  They are <i>creating</i> the money that pays them.<br/>
<br/>
The traditional chains though?  Can they produce enough extra money to pay a share to gaming stores and distributor warehouses and publisher offices and all that?  Off of the new people they can bring to my book?  Across broad swaths of the industry, the answer seems to be "No, they can't."  Doesn't mean that will always be the answer, but it seems to be the rule of thumb so far.                        </div>

                            Well and IPR does the shipping and warehousing. I mean that's what makes Ben and Vincent have to do no work. So even if they didn't make for new customers, it'd be worth it just for that. Put another way, the only thing that Mongoose would do more than IPR is their marketing - which they've admitted in their estimate would be no better than the IPR/Vincent marketing. But would produce far, far less profit for Vincent.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the thing. The market for a RPG is quite finite in a period of time. There simply are only X people out there willing to buy any particular RPG at a time. And it's not hard to attract the majority of them. If, in fact, Vincent sells to that other 1000 people, that's 1000 people out of his revenue stream that might eventually buy at the higher profit margin. What incentive does he have to burn through his market at one tenth the profitability?<br/>
<br/>
And that all assumes that he would retain all rights and that the product would be in no way damaged by the Mongoose handling. Much safer to go with the plan he's on now.<br/>
<br/>
Now, all that said, would there never be a reason to go with Mongoose? I think that under certain limited circumstances that, sure, Mongoose would be the right choice. A D20 supplement, for instance, might be best coming from Mongoose. If you need capital, and they can provide it (though the start up capital for a game these days is just so little that this is would almost require the liscencing or something mentioned above to be sensible). I don't think that anyone is saying that Mongoose could never be the right choice. Merely that one should consider everything as Vincent did before making a decision.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Tony, Indy was afraid of snakes, duh. How's he going to set one on fire if he doesn't even want to get close to it!<br/>
