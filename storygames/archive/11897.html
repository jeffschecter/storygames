A slew of skills and look-up tables is quite cool, but annoying in play.<br/><br/>As I'm going to be running a one-off in the not-too-distant future, I'm thinking of using a 3-die Otherkind system- 1 die for success, 1 die for injury sustained, 1 die to avoid being seen doing it. That and the treason tokens from the card game I've got knocking about and I think I'll be set.<br/><br/>One potential problem is handling secret rolling- is it worth going to the trouble of getting little matchboxes or something so players shield their result and pass it to me if they want to do something discreetly, or will passing dice around as well as notes bog the game down too much? Would it be better to let the roll happen in the open, given that what it was for may still be privileged information?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265637">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265637/#Comment_265637" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T12:12:37+00:00" title="April  5, 2010 12:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Secret rolling: if the other players can't know, whyever should you have the player himself roll? Wouldn't it be easier for the GM to make those rolls? If you want to have the player decide which categories to priorize, just give him cards with the categories and let him stack them for the GM's benefit. The player won't know which categories succeeded or failed, but he'll know which he tried to make succeed. Of course the GM might decide to put the dice in some other order, anyway.<br/><br/>As for changing the rules: If it were me, I'd make that the centerpiece of an adventure. Like, the troubleshooters find some highly illegal secret society literature (Illuminati makes sense) that describes the "rules of the Alpha Complex". The players soon figure that this is actually the Paranoia XP rulebook in a loose-leaf photocopy edition. Let them get into trouble over it and use it for amazing feats (gaining a high stature in the Sierra Club or some other secret society seems warranted, for example, should a PC manage to leverage his secret lore) before you reveal the "upgrade" going on in the higher echelons of society, complete with purges. Soon they'll find that the rules-set has actually changed, outdating their secret lore and probably getting them into trouble. The first time they'll notice is when you start refusing their d20 rolls and push Otherkind dice at them. Don't tell them the new rules, let them find them out by experimentation, Mao-style. Simultaneously with this reveal a new ad campaign: the Computer wants you to get a special health check-up, only for 100 creds per head (Alpha Complex is capitalist in the new edition, wasn't it?). NPCs that have gone through the new special procedure act weirdly and only talk about something called "GNS" and killing "puppies" - they're clearly pod-persons. When you manage to herd any PCs into the treatment take away their old character sheets and give them the new one, prefilled. Except one of them gets an empty sheet instead and has to fill it himself in a Computer-controlled interrogation. Perhaps some character might be smart enough to avoid the treatment, in which case you'll allow him to use the old character sheet (and perhaps the old rules, occasionally) for however long they'll manage to avoid detection.<br/><br/>Obviously I'm old-school about Paranoia rules - the actual rules mechanics are just there as a player crutch, the GM doesn't have to care about them as anything but matter for rpg-related comedy. If you want to change them, go ahead, but at least make it entertaining.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265658">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265658/#Comment_265658" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T14:00:28+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  2:00PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had actually been toying around with the idea for quite a while about doing a rules-lite version of Paranoia. The old-school 2nd Edition rules were actually really, really good, until it came to damage (seems like they've all fallen down when it comes to making damage as easy as the rest of the game). But my thought was having each of the service groups being an "ability" score (to do things appropriate to that service group), as well as a mutant "ability" (to do traitorous mutant-y things), and a secret society "ability" (to do secret society things). Roll d20 and try to get as high as you can without going over your ability. And with damage and armor, take the successful attack + weapon damage, and roll d20+ armor protection (but only if it's the correct colored armor!) to try and beat it, or else suffer a Wound, etc.<br/><br/>...now that I think about it, it is very much the rule system for Bizenghast (surprising good for something based off a ho-hum American manga).<br/><br/>As for Otherkind dice, maybe try the rules in Donjon? Roll a bunch of d20s based on your ability, trying to beat the rolls of the opponent? Plus it has great ways for successful rolls to influence information and events. PLUS the GM can just roll a crapload of d20s, not telling anyone that only some of them are actually counting (just to be a jerk and build...well...some paranoia!)<br/>...or do a version of Dungeon Squad.<br/><br/>But I would be very interested to see how you end up handling Paranoia.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265661">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus" title="Ignotus"><img alt="Ignotus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ignotus">Ignotus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265661/#Comment_265661" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T14:08:37+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  2:08PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played Paranoia with Solar System and with Misery Bubblegum (in a clone creche).

If you want it for Paranoia, I should warn you that we were essentially playing an anime high school paranoia story (not that things weren't awesome - for instance, the characters needed to cheat on a test, but there was no way my computer-loving President of the junior anti-sex leaguewas going to be having any of it.  So they broken into the brainwashing room, tried to brainwash the memories out of me, and ended up accidentally killing my character.  Fortunately, my fresh clone had no recollection their scheme!).<br/><br/>BTW, here's the gist of my solar system conversion:<br/>Culture = pick a secret society, get access to it's specialty skills<br/>Skill :: Pool<br/>Management :: Access (social)<br/>Calisthenics :: Vigor (physical)<br/>Reaction :: Conditioning (mental)<br/><br/>Everyone gets a free point in energy weapons<br/><br/>Skills: <br/>Access - chutzpah, bootlicking, con games, hygeiene, interrogation, intimidation, moxie (reading others), oratory, disguise, security, Data analysis (ask the computer questions), data search (gather info), C-bay (getting items)<br/>Vigor - Energy weapons, primitive weapons, demolitions, hand-to-hand combat, fine manipulation, vehicles, stealth, athletics<br/>Conditioning - Maintenance/operation (choose robots, vehicles, or weaponry), Engineering (choose chemical, electronic, habitat, mechanical, or nuclear), programming (bot or vehicle), hacking, financial systems, biosciences, cloning, medicine, outdoor life, pharmatherapy, psychotherapy<br/><br/>You get the key of the troubleshooter for free:<br/><br/>Key of the Troubleshooter<br/>1 xp\u2013 Boot Licking.<br/>2 xp\u2013 Lie to PC/Superior.<br/>5 xp\u2013 Accuse someone of treason.<br/>Buy-Off: Stand up for someone, when betraying them would benefit you.<br/><br/><br/>Make up another key.  Possible ideas for keys include your secret society or your service group, or one of the mandatory bonus duties: loyalty officer, happiness officer, team leader, equipment officer, comms and recording, hygeine officer.  Alternatively, you could just take a normal sort of key like conscience, criminal, despair, greed, martyr, etc.<br/><br/>Roll up your mutant power on the table, and the GM will make up an appropriate secret.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_265680">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/265680/#Comment_265680" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-05T16:32:47+00:00" title="April  5, 2010  4:32PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most intense and disturbing concept I've seen for Paranoia used A Penny for my Thoughts.

The GM-as-Computer is completely in character and enhancing the experience for everyone when she fudges, ignores wide swaths of system and is inconsistent about details (or non-details). In fact sending up RPGs themselves was as much of an aim of the designers as sending up Reagan. You can argue that the stuff you hate about Paranoia XP is in fact there to be ignored in a much more intentional way than any other RPG.<br/><br/>That said, 1) I play Paranoia using InSpectres these days, and 2) I think FreeMarket is even more subversive because it's a positive statement rather than a negative one. That is, instead of just lampooning what it stands against, it presents an alternative. That's pretty rare these days.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_265794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I even posted a thread here looking from some advice.<br/><br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11757&amp;page=1#Item_7" rel="nofollow">Clicky</a><br/><br/>So far it's going great, but I have a couple problems with the system myself. Combat isn't one of them though. We've only had one combat so far, but it ran quickly. The skill list for sure has a lot of redundancy. I could probably cut it in half no problem. There are several places in the book where the rules contradict themselves (attribute drain and refresh for example). Also, the GM advice is kind of all other the place when it comes to whether you're trying to make the players or their characters paranoid and about IC vs OOC knowledge. Perversity Points are kind of weird as written too (I treat them as a purely metagame resource for the record).<br/><br/>I made it clear to my players like this: Alpha Complex is a large, dysfunctional bureaucracy. You are competent in your fields, but like in most systems like this, you cannot expect your competence to be rewarded or your failures to be punished appropriately. The only real way to advance is by uncovering mutant, traitorous scum. You are all mutant, traitorous scum. You will probably need to take massive risks that could expose you to expose your teammates, complete missions, and satisfy your secret society. The only good way to protect yourself against charges that will come from these risks is to use your skills to resolve conflict in your favor and earn big Perversity Points by creating funny and dramatic moments at the table. Be creative or die.<br/><br/>This set a somewhat more Straight tone then the Classic I originally envisioned, but it's been going great. I've been using conflict resolution, "say yes or roll dice", and haven't been fudging. I've rewarded the players for taking risks, being funny, and using OOC knowledge to set up cool moments. I think note passing and rolling for the player to hide results when appropriate has been extremely valuable in terms of setting the tone (they indicate when they private reply to me in the wave).<br/><br/>So, to address your point more directly, I don't think it would hurt at all to use a more abstract system for skills and combat. (I really like the idea of everyone have a Service Firm and Secret Society skill.) I would definitely kept the hidden checks and note passing though. The principles behind what your version of Alpha Complex is about and what the absolutes are in terms of rules of the setting are probably more important than the resolution mechanics.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
