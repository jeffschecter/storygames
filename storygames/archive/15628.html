Race because being a tiefling, githzerai, or a rogue modron or whatnot is kind of a bigger deal, to me, than being an elf of a dwarf (the 'human' playbook would probably just be a couple 'take a move from your class playbook' 'take a move from your faction playbook' 'take a move from any other class playbook' style stuff.) The faction "playbooks" would probably be small, like, one move you start off with, one or two moves you can take as you advance in level if you want to progress in faction rather than class or race.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354228/#Comment_354228" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T07:34:51+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  7:34AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, I think it'd be easy enough to do racial moves for the class playbooks, instead of whole separate race playbooks. Planescape is really more about beliefs and how you beat others over the head with them and change the very makeup of the planes with them, than it is about identifying with your race. A bariaur sensate and a succubus sensate are both sensates, and would presumably get along just fine in the Civic Festhall, though they'd probably have dissimilar abilities and classes. I say keep it to one or maybe two racial moves per race, and give each class a few different races to pick from (more than ordinary DW), because having wildly different races is more about injecting elements of the fantastic in Planescape than it is about anything else.<br/><br/>TL;DR: Planescape is about beliefs, not species.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354233/#Comment_354233" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T10:11:50+00:00" title="January 14, 2012 10:11AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right.

Factions are important in Planescape, but I don't think I'd start out with them on the character sheet. They'd be something that comes up in play, through NPCs or Fronts (as John said), and if you can make your way into being a member of one of them, you get a special move or a special alignment move or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354258/#Comment_354258" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-14T15:33:39+00:00" title="January 14, 2012  3:33PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            They could definitely be.

You're not a wizard, you're The Wizard, even though you will encounter other magic users. And so forth.<br/><br/>Take that attitude to Planescape, and a player who chooses the Sensates playbook is not (just) playing a member of the Sensate faction, the character is The Sensate faction, embodied. Or Dustman. Or Free Leaguer. Or Xaositect. If you want to focus on the struggle between the factions, I can't think of a better way to do it. Of course that does almost guarantee a lot of conflict among the PCs. <br/><br/>Factions will work as fronts either if all of the PCs are members of the same faction or none of them belong to any faction (which essentially is the same as belonging to the Free League), at least initially. Actually, I may be mistaken about that, but my understanding was that fronts begin as opposition to the PCs, so PCs would not start out belonging to / aligned with a front.<br/><br/>Incidentally I just did a search for Planescape on the AW forums, and turned up just two passing references, so unfortunately there's no help for you there (presuming you haven't looked already). <br/><br/>Another reason to handle factions as playbooks is if you're more interested in a campaign that uses Sigil as a jumping-off point for exploring the outer planes. In that case you have the older potential of fronts of the variously-aligned planes and conflicts like the Blood War (between demons and devils) or the Modron March. You can then play the factions as the players choosing their philosophical stance in reaction to the extremes of the outer planes, which is more or less what the concept of the factions is in the first place. So, the modrons are a threat, because they want to swarm outward and impose Absolute Order on everyone else. How do the players feel about that? Is it a problem or an opportunity or just something to ignore? Different factions will have different takes on that. The players' choices of factions may color how they react, or reacting to the front may cause the players to pick up a particular faction playbook.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_354431">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354431/#Comment_354431" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T00:38:57+00:00" title="January 16, 2012 12:38AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I'd love to avoid undue work (hacking AW for Planescape seems like a lot more work than hacking DW) for what's not a "design project" (in terms of creation &amp; publishing) but rather a "play" one. I plan to go forward with using DW, just because it seems easier, but I'll keep a spot in the back of my head that's open to the prospect. I guess what I'm saying is: I'm not sure if the work of hacking AW will be worth the rewards in play vs. the work of hacking DW.<br/><br/>Hacking AW vs. Hacking DW for this project seems to be, at the most fundamental level, a decision between writing up whole new playbooks vs. changing a few things on the DW playbooks. Though of course if one did the former looking hard at how DW works would be a good second step (after looking hard at how AW works).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_354454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354454/#Comment_354454" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-16T07:57:27+00:00" title="January 16, 2012  7:57AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You should totally do whatever works for you.

It'd be pretty easy to make the Operator into a mercenary/thief type, making the Saavyhead  and Brainer into different types of sorcerers, etc.<br/><br/>I think the thing that made me consider leaning more in the AW direction was that the Fronts in Planescape seem to be mostly other people and dark twisted fantasy things, not treasure and monsters and loot and traps and stuff.

I mean, suppose they all start as Primes. In that case, they might join a faction later. How does a group stay together if they join different factions? It's different than the assumed dungeon delving of DW.<br/><br/>Or, hmm, maybe this isn't a problem. From an AW standpoint, the group doesn't all need to be together doing the same things. I suppose thinking very hard about my version of <i>bonds</i> will be key. And then again Jonathan may be right about AW being better for this.

Seems like it has much more in common with sandbox-y 1980s-1990s games like Vampire, Shadowrun, Rifts, Warhammer Fantasy, and the like.  And looking at the other AD&amp;D settings like Dark Sun and such, those seem very similar as well.  They're heavy on setting and color and weird player races and not very interested in gold or fighting monsters in dungeons or iron spikes.  That's definitely why I think AW would be a better fit, since it's much more in that sandbox-y vein.  Like, with all the crazy races and factions, you're gonna play a cleric or fighter?  That seems wrong.  You should be a half-demon member of the assassin's league, with a cursed sword that has to drink fresh blood every four hours.

So you have character types: <b>The Naive Prime</b>, or <b>The Factol</b>, things along those lines. Then you pick a racial move, and class move. That could get complex, with separate class playbooks and such. It might be hard to avoid that, but I'd like to. I wonder if one class move at the beginning, and maybe one more advanced one down the line would be enough to make you feel like you're the Naive Prime (fighter), as opposed to the Naive Prime (wizard). Oh, and of course, picking your initial class move automatically picks your statline.<br><br>Because as much as Planescape fits weirdly (or not at all) with the game of D&amp;D, it does have those trappings, and it did spring forth from D&amp;D.

They are something there for the players to get entangled in or menaced by or to ignore until they become a problem you can't ignore anymore. Isn't that exactly how they work in practice in Planscape? If you want to make player membership in factions a think, make mini-playbooks for them in the style of the Walking Dead playbook.<br/><br/>So for a given faction we have a mini playbook. The mini playbook has a move or condition required to take moves from that faction. It has several moves you can take. If you later abandon the faction, no big deal. You just take moves from another playbook. It's also less work than making complete playbooks (for factions that might not be played!).<br/><br/>That said, Phil's case for playbooks is pretty solid, if that's the way you want to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355255">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355255/#Comment_355255" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-21T09:44:28+00:00" title="January 21, 2012  9:44AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, Tony.

Hmm. This is going against what I'd been thinking of doing, though. It's making me reconsider. I'd been thinking (like I said upthread) of having playbooks like <b>The Prime</b>, or <b>The Planar</b>, or <b>The Factol</b>. The Prime is that cheeky clueless who just stepped into a portal to Sigil. The Factol's a lot more like the hardholder. He's already in a Faction, though, and doesn't need a mini-playbook. It would feel weird if the Prime or Planar did need that mini-playbook, where the Factol didn't.<br/><br/>Oh, duh, though: the solution's so obvious: The Factol, as part of character creation, just chooses one of the Faction mini-playbooks.<br/><br/>Thanks folks, lots of good juice here. I'm still at the step where I'm just soaking in Planescape, reading the books.

That could get complex, with separate class playbooks and such. It might be hard to avoid that, but I'd like to. I wonder if one class move at the beginning, and maybe one more advanced one down the line would be enough to make you feel like you're the Naive Prime (fighter), as opposed to the Naive Prime (wizard).

There may be other adventurers in the world, but those jerks are NPCs and charlatans and pretenders to your awesomeness.  It's a way for us to really amp up the significance of the players.  In play, in many groups, I suspect this is a semantic distinction.

Given that, in DW, you don't change playbooks.  That said, you're going to go with whatever feels like what Planescape is like in your head, regardless of what anyone else says, which is exactly what you, you know, should be doing, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355440/#Comment_355440" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T08:03:43+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  8:03AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure too much should be read into the "THE" in AW.

You're THE Hardholder because what you do matters in a way that what the other Hardholders do doesn't.

So, y'know, if your character concept is "Tiefling Thief" you don't necessarily have to even choose a background or faction, but if you want to play a Dimensional-Explorer Rogue-Modron Sensate Wizard, you're also free to.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355449/#Comment_355449" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T08:56:15+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  8:56AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still think faction mini playbook, a la walking dead, are the way to go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_355454">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355454/#Comment_355454" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T09:31:31+00:00" title="January 23, 2012  9:31AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly out of an interest to keep the number of the actual physical objects low (and because it's easier to keep a strong thematic core to one thing than while going across several)...<br/>\n<br/>\nHow about making "thematic" playbooks and then, right at chargen, have every one of them have the option "take a move from another playbook."<br/>\n<br/>\nInstant sorceror-warriors, tielfing thieves, and demonic faction leaders.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_355489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/355489/#Comment_355489" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-23T12:43:14+00:00" title="January 23, 2012 12:43PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite><br><br>Seems to me that if your position in the Faction is mutable but your class isn't, we've just defined what's a playbook and what's not.

Planescape definitely needs to broaden the scope to include the Lawful-Chaotic axis.<br>-rewrite <b>bonds</b> (as needed) for Sigil-appropriate adventuring.<br><br>I think the real work will be with GM rules, though, not player-centric stuff.<br><br/>-Look hard at <b>agenda</b>, <b>principles</b>, and <b>moves</b>. Cut out stuff that doesn't fit Planescape (if any) and add stuff that's necessary.<br/>-Make some Planescape <b>front</b>s. Ideally, the project will expand in scope to include rules/advice on how to create Planescape fronts, but right now I'm trying to get this thing to hit the table, and that'll come later, if at all (seeing what Sage &amp; Adam have done with Front/Monster creation stuff will give me a good direction to go in, I'm sure).<br/><br/>So that's where I'm going with it. After some hack/design work has been done, I can evaluate a little better if it's "Planescape" enough. Play will really tell, though! I'm hoping to run Planescape Dungeon World at <a href="http://www.gamestorm.org/" rel="nofollow">Gamestorm</a> in late March, if not sooner.<br/><br/><b>Longer term</b>, I'm interested in looking at creating faction mini-playbooks, and maybe adding a rule about changing alignment during play. For the latter, it's probably something like, "when you decide to do it (some specific-enough but still broad action relating to your new alignment--most likely, "The GM will tell you what you have to do"), you do it (change alignment)".<br/><br/>I still have soft spot in my heart for the "Character Archetype" approach (a la the Prime, the Factol, etc.), but I'm hopeful that further design and play will show that it's not necessary for what I'm going for. As Adam has said privately, that approach can be problematic.<br/><br/>Oh, lastly: I'm going to look hard at the basic moves, as well. I don't expect anything to change, but it just might. Obviously if that changes, it portends rippling changes throughout the whole thing. Also, I'm excited! I think once S&amp;A release the full PDF with front creation &amp; such we'll be seeing a flood of Dungeon World hacking.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356522">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356522/#Comment_356522" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T03:12:43+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  3:12AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it would be very flavorful if different planes and locales acted as fronts AND gave moves to people that are there or somehow have an alignment to the plane. <br/><br/>Travellers that are familiar with the psychology/spiritual physics of a plane could exploit it. This would also explain the powers passed down by gods/demons.. faith would become a way to affiliate and open up a channel to that plane.<br/><br/>E.g: The Happy Hunting Grounds will have a set of moves related to nature. For example you could teleport within the plane by entering a tree.  You will not know these moves the first time you enter the plane. Once you know them and you play with them you will have an advantage on that plane. If you are affiliated to a divinity of the HHGrounds or you hold an artefact from the HHG you could replicate these moves on other planes too, for a price.<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Plane" rel="nofollow">Simple map of the Outer Planes</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356523/#Comment_356523" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-29T03:23:25+00:00" title="January 29, 2012  3:23AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2012 3:51AM by Hans_c-o.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool, Ivan, I like it.<br/><br/>Also, thinking about other planes just now gave me an idea: a good first (one-shot, too) adventure would be to start with the party stuck on some dangerous plane together trying to make their way back to Sigil. I'm trying to go Sigil-centric at first, to make it, well, actually <i>Planescape</i>, but I'm worried about how to incorporate all the other stuff, too. I may have said it upthread, but doing custom bonds for one-shots can help here, I think. Like: "Erin Darkflame Montgomery (in Sigil) promised me a reward if I retrieved her Clueless cousin _______ back from the prisons of Baator". Where _____ is the party member/reason everyone starts the adventure in a prison in Baator.<br/><br/>Reading the Planescape books gives me lots of ideas, but I want to make something usable even if you <i>haven't</i> read those books. And I don't want to always have to go back and read a tome to be able to craft fronts. It's hard to distill an established setting without cutting out lots of the cool little bits that made one like it in the first place, and also without having to explain to everyone at the table what everything means. "Okay, you're Clueless, which means..." I can foresee things happening in the middle of the session such that the GM goes, "No, you wouldn't do that! You wouldn't know that!", etc. Trying not to give up hope, here.

You could even call it, like, <b>The Dungeon World Planejammer's Codex</b>, or something along those lines.  And it could include a lot of "advanced fuckery" stuff for creating weird planes and classes and factions and what not ("Planefuckers Codex" sounds amazing as well, actually).<br/><br/>Here's an idea I just had for handling plane-crawling!  You could treat it like a combination of gigs and the commander's moves from The Regiment.  So each plane is a different gig and the person leading the mission rolls the dice.  So, if you just need to go to Ravenloft and steal some sacred artifact, roll your "Ravenloft gig" (based on your prior experience there) and maybe it's an easy trip, we skip over the details, and you show back up in Sigil with the thing.  But maybe you get a different result and we jump right into the action of you and your crew being in trouble (and the plane would have some specific failure conditions for the GM to choose from: "trapped in the crypt," "in Strahd's clutches").  Or, alternately, the GM can ask you to roll for a different set of results: either the general "Planecrawler" move or a specific move they've built for Ravenloft.  And that works like The Regiment, with the move simply setting up the conditions for how we start off your experiences in that plane.  Did you teleport into the right place? Are you surrounded by monsters? Are all the members of your party in the same place? Etc.<br/><br/>I feel like that kind of dual-system (which is how gigs work, kinda) lets you either zoom in on the plane-hopping action or focus on how it affects Sigil, without having to play out every adventure or fetch-quest if it's not the focus of what's currently going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356713/#Comment_356713" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T08:30:10+00:00" title="January 30, 2012  8:30AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, so I've still been thinking of this: leaning more towards the AW stats in the moves I've been coming up with than DW stats, though...<br/><br/>Dimensional Explorer sample move:<br/><br/>Portal Expert: When you study a portal carefully, roll +sharp.

Especially if your game is focused more on the exploration aspect of Planescape - adventurers exploring strange and fantastical places created from beliefs, interacting with the powers and fighting monsters. <br/><br/>However if the part of Planescape that interests you more is the beliefs and how people live in Sigil amongst the Planes, then AW prob provides more support for that type of play. <br/><br/>So it all really depends on what type of play experience you want out of the setting, then make you hack decisions from that. <br/><br/>Also I am really digging on the idea of the mini-playbooks for the Factions with plenty of move choices, which is similar to the Faction based move with an additional Alignment EXP earn I started myself for my DW Planescape game idea.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356748">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356748/#Comment_356748" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-30T11:30:07+00:00" title="January 30, 2012 11:30AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can only speak of my personal inspirations, which are like: Planescape, R. Sean Borgstrom's ludicrous vision of hell from Exalted (i.e. Malfeas, which is pretty obviously Planescape-inspired), Brom and RK Post's crazy bondage-fantasy art, Rifts Wormwood, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplaying, Earthsea, Everway, the more dungeonpunk-y art of Wayne Reynolds, the German post-apocalyptic angel game Engel, the French surreal fantasy game Agone, Italo Calvino's insane po-mo novel Invisible Cities, and a childhood playing way too much Rifts and In Nomine. Also, globalization, urbanization, colonialism, and Miyazaki-style spiritualism/environmentalism, to provide some political and emotional grounding.<br/><br/>That said, my intent is for every page to be a contained set of optional rules, so you can plug in whatever combination of stuff you like.  The planes stuff will also be modular, so you'll create your own map of the planes that feature in your game, leaving room to add more or create your own later.  It's definitely a cookbook and, while they'll be some suggested setting elements (like the inter-planar city of Dis), they're also plug-and-play like everything else. Take 'em or leave 'em.<br/><br/>Hans is working on the plane stuff right now, Mendel, but your tables sound awesome.

For example, coming up with the weird races that are the most common and numerous in the living inter-planar city of Dis.  I know I want some kind of mantis people and ancient magical robot soldiers.  And humans, of course. And probably some demon people.  Who else should live there? Elemental people? Walrus people?<br/><br/>In my mind, the core game is "planar delving" (dungeon crawling except with planes replacing dungeons) + "factional urban politicking and adventuring" (in the vein of Vampire, Shadowrun, Warhammer Fantasy, and Fritz Leiber).  When you start a session, you're either going to a plane, in the midst of a planar trip, or have just gotten back from one, and/or are engaged in some subversive or quazi-criminal activities in the inter-planar city.  And the city politics often require planar delving, either to gain an advantage or to escape from the people who are after you.  The players probably start out as members of some kind of mercenary enterprise or factional grouping and will all have bonds and history with each other, as normal.  And you probably start the game with some people who already hate you and want you dead, either in the city or on some of the planes you've previously visited.<br/><br/>Or, of course, you can just play your existing DW characters and have them gradually become immersed in the life of a planarch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357150/#Comment_357150" name="Item_126" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T09:53:08+00:00" title="February  1, 2012  9:53AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 2. On a failure, you still hold 1. Spend this hold 1-for-1 during play to make a heritage move, just like that.<br/>When you gain new appreciation for your heritage, add a new heritage move or change an existing one</i>.<br/><br/>What moves would rat-men Githyanki have? Also maybe they have a tie to their people that acts like a faction.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, you should <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15778&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">see this thread</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_358487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/358487/#Comment_358487" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-09T10:08:02+00:00" title="February  9, 2012 10:08AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 9, 2012 10:33AM by Hans_c-o.">edited February 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JBMannon</cite><a href="/forums/profile/Hans">@Hans</a> I would recommend talking to Joe Mcdaldno about how strings work in his game Monsterhearts. Particularly look at the skin, The Chosen. I think strings can really bring a lot into a Planescape game. Strings work somewhat like bonds but there are moves that allow the players to add strings to NPCs as well as other PCs. I certainly think it is worth looking at.</blockquote>\nHmm...<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15748&amp;page=1#Item_11" rel="nofollow">OK, I'll talk to Joe</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TallPaul" title="TallPaul"><img alt="TallPaul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/761/nEEFJAV72ZSZR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TallPaul">TallPaul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407929/#Comment_407929" name="Item_142" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T02:29:37+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  2:29AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So what exactly needs to be done in order to set Dungeon World in Planescape?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407945">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407945/#Comment_407945" name="Item_143" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T06:30:17+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  6:30AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Get your hands on The Planarch Codex: Dark Heart of the Dreamer supplement.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TallPaul" title="TallPaul"><img alt="TallPaul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/761/nEEFJAV72ZSZR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TallPaul">TallPaul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408021/#Comment_408021" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T12:58:17+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 12:58PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice.
