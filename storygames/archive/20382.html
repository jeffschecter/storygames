This is the second year. It runs from 5 to 30 October 2015.<br/><br/><b>What is a Golden Cobra?</b><br/>Only the baddest-ass snake in the jungle, which is something you should always aspire to be. <br/><br/>The goal of the 2015 contest is to generate small, intense, personal games.<br/><br/>Golden Cobras will be awarded in five categories:<br/>- Best use of themes/techniques for evoking empathy<br/>- Best incorporation of perspectives of unheard or marginalized people or groups<br/>- Best incorporation of touch<br/>- Game we're most excited about<br/>- Most polished and ready-to-play game<br/><br/><b>What are the competition constraints?</b><br/>In order to be considered for a Golden Cobra, your game must:<br/>- Be playable from start to finish in two hours or less, by people who are not you.<br/>- Playable by a fixed or variable but small number of participants, from zero to no more than four.<br/><br/><b>What are the Rules for Entering?</b><br/>- Be a new, unpublished freeform larp. It is neither a tabletop roleplaying game or a video game, although it may approach or incorporate either.<br/>- Your name can only appear on one entry but teams are welcome.<br/>- Submit your game by 30 October in .pdf format and in English to submissions@goldencobra.com. Parallel versions in other languages or other formats are encouraged.<br/>- Present your game in a playable format. If it needs handouts, they must be included.<br/>- Games playable in public will earn the warm regard of the judges but are not required.<br/>- Games with zero players must abide by the contest rules.<br/>- You retain all rights to your work but grant the judges permission to print out and play the game you submit, and for it to be included in a free anthology after the contest.<br/><br/><b>What is freeform?</b><br/>What we call freeform larp occupies a middle space between tabletop and full-blown live action role playing. They come in all shapes and sizes, all along the spectrum and keep incorporating new things as they come along. As a rule of thumb if there are simple, clever game mechanics but you have to stand up and move around at some point, it's probably freeform larp! There's more discussion in the FAQ, but our definitions are pretty loose.<br/><br/><b>Can I get some help?</b><br/>Yes! If you would like to be put in touch with a more experienced designer or a peer for advice and mentorship, write to help@goldencobra.org. The judges will try to connect you with someone. If you would like to be a mentor, let us know! We\u2019ll probably ask you to even if you don\u2019t.<br/><br/><b>Can I spread the word?</b><br/>Please do! <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mp0n0ha4r98ljv7/golden_cobra_2015_final.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">Here's a .pdf flyer </a><br/><br/>Here's the Website, with additional FAQs:<br/><a href="http://www.goldencobra.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.goldencobra.org/</a><br/><br/><b>Who are the judges?</b><br/>Whitney Beltr\xe1n, J Li, Jason Morningstar and Evan Torner, assisted by Judge Emeritus Emily Care Boss and others. <br/><br/><b>What happens next?</b><br/>The judges will announce and <i>run </i>the winning games at Metatopia, 5-8 November 2015. The winners get bragging rights and everyone gets a new game they designed - and admission into the Golden Cobra\u2019s Circle of Power!\ufeff                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448898/#Comment_448898" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-06T18:53:58+00:00" title="October  6, 2015  6:53PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2015 6:54PM by BeePeeGee.">edited October 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great Jason.

If it happens to be able to accommodate six that's fine, although not really in the spirit of what we're after, which is very small, intimate games. If it is a six-player game you can sort of play with two roles removed, please don't submit it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
