For that, I think you'll need something that's either really simple (like Dungeon Squad) or really well known (like d20).  I think things like an Oracle and set difficulties won't sit well with player-created content like Donjon and the like, since those thrive on no-one knowing what's coming next.  You might find a way to make that work though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_124501">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/twilight" title="twilight"><img alt="twilight" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/twilight">twilight</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/124501/#Comment_124501" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-05T06:53:00+00:00" title="February  5, 2008  6:53AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here I thought I was having issues trying to decide between <i>In a Wicked Age</i> or <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> for my next D&amp;D-like campaign.

Example being, the GM decides a difficulty rating for a given task. The player rolls against his or her skill and attempts to achieve that result. I had been focusing more on <a href="/forums/search?Search=%234&amp;Mode=like">#4</a>, players control the level of difficulty, which can be implemented by either the GM or player also introducing the Gift of Dice from TSoY.<br/><br/>I kind of envision it like: the GM sets the difficulty at X. A player could consciously choose 0, 1 or 2 penalty dice and, as with Raising the Stakes, achieve extra stuff upon success. Likewise, a GM or player could give 0, 1 or 2 bonus dice to the task; effectively, swapping doing Cool Things for just plowing through the task and getting it accomplished.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
