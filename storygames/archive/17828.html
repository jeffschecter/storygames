( <a href="http://rpggeek.com/thread/909049/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://rpggeek.com/thread/909049/</a> ) Considering 3 out of the 5 of these guys have never roleplayed/barely roleplayed before I am truly flabagasted.<br/><br/>However it's the most recent post in this game that has me writing this missive. It has taken the opening scene into a place I would never have thought of in a million years. I started reading it thinking "okay, what gives, he's making this way too easy...!" and by the end was thinking "...holy doughnuts, how the hell are they getting out of this one!?? The man is a genius!"<br/><br/>For your delectation I provide for you here that last magic post:<br/><br/><del>|                      |</del><br/><br/>"Any update?"<br/><br/>Rexin dropped his headphones onto the control panel. "Yes sir, Commander Flint. As you know, our contact aboard Hand of Sorrow has managed to exert some influence on Captain Hollas. Our friends were taken to a set of rooms very close to the docking bay, where their ship is being held. They were given only a few guards. Meanwhile, we're scrambling the Imperial wireless as much as possible to buy them some time. Also, there's a --"<br/><br/>"I know all of this already," Flint grunted. "I asked for an update, Rexin. Has Natasha and her group been able to escape Imperial custody?"<br/><br/>Rexin looked down at the knobs in front of him, fiddling with a few in nervous hesitation. He had great respect for the commander, but had been around long enough to know the man's fiery temper. Even now, Rexin's delay was causing Flint's face to redden. When combined with his long, smokey gray hair, the man seemed almost a living flame.<br/><br/>"It seems there's another vessel that just docked, Commander." Rexin began anxiously. "A nobleman's craft. The good news is that Captain Hollas has redirected all but one of the guards watching our friends to be part of a large honor guard, sent to meet the nobleman at the docking bay. That should make it easier for --"<br/><br/>"And just who", Flint interrupted again, "is this nobleman?"<br/><br/>Rexin's voice was almost a whisper. "It... It's Count Carlowe, sir."<br/><br/>Flint looked up at the ceiling and let out a long sigh. Rexin, realizing that Flint wasn't going to shoot the messenger this time, relaxed for a brief moment before Flint's fist slammed down on a nearby railing, sending various radio parts flying. A soldier who had just entered to speak to the commander quickly turned around and fled before he could be noticed.<br/><br/>"So what you're telling me, Rexin," Flint breathed, his low voice and slow pace a clear attempt to keep himself in control, "Is that Natasha's ship is being held in a docking bay filled with nearly all of the soldiers in Hollas' command, sent to greet the Imperial vermin Bavloch Carlowe, her former fiance and the man who is most likely to recognize and expose her?"<br/><br/>Rexin tried to find his voice, but couldn't. After a moment, he simply nodded.<br/><br/>To his surprise, a small smirk appeared on the commander's face. "All right, my little blackbird," Flint murmured. "This is what you've trained for. Make me proud."<br/><br/><br/><del>|                    |</del> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bifford" title="Bifford"><img alt="Bifford" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bifford">Bifford</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403469/#Comment_403469" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T13:00:51+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  1:00PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I should probably mention (for those of you who don't want to read the thread) that they had one guard by their cells and currently two of the cell doors are open and the one guard comatose on the floor after a nasty punch from Ms Bishop lol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403500/#Comment_403500" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T18:22:48+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  6:22PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.
