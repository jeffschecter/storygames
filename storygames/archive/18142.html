I'm also going to be reading Savage Worlds and Cortex soon as well so I fully expect at least one of the three to hook me. <br/><br/>But I want to know your thoughts. As a player who values mechanics that aid the roleplaying and keep the flow of story going which of these systems do you think would suit me? I'm open to all genres, just looking for a system that helps me tell a story with my friends and have some randomizers involved.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_409620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/409620/#Comment_409620" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-19T14:31:17+00:00" title="March 19, 2013  2:31PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fate encourages you to engage the story on a high level, and to keep things narratively interesting.

Essentially, I love the aspects mechanic but skills and stunts leave me cold. I've tried setting up a game with it, but we sort of got stuck at character generation (admittedly, I've learned a <b>lot</b> of the last few months and wouldn't dream of organising a game like I tried then). Is there really a reason why you can't just have aspects? And is there not an easier way to generate aspects? I like the fact that the standard rules of FATE 3 require fewer aspects; hopefully it will address some of my other issues as well.<br/><br/>Cortex+ Drama/Smallville (along with FATE/Starblazer) were what first alerted me that games could be more collaborative than what I, as a lapsed trad rpger, had assumed was possible. It's certainly simpler than the other two. I'm itching to give it a go at some point. Any system which encourages players to think about their relationships with every die roll is good in my book.<br/><br/>Of the three, Savage Worlds is the only one I have any experience of actually playing. I enjoyed it but found combat really clunky - mainly because my players didn't know all the options (I think this is a common issue with what Ron Edwards would call fortune-at-the-end systems). I ended up creating little cards, a bit like I understand how D&amp;D4e is organised, but the game was short lived. I'm not sure it really met my needs as a storyteller.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410146/#Comment_410146" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T15:52:43+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  3:52PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I like FATE but I find it a bit too crunchy for my tastes.

But you like Cortex, and from my limited knowledge (I'm only halfway through the "Supernatural" core book) the skill systems seem pretty similar, with a mostly-hardcoded list of skills that you can pick a limited number of at varying strengths. Stunts are somewhat like Cortex's specialized skills.<br/><br/>If you took out skills altogether and focused on aspect, you'd have to remove the Fate point cost of using them. My hunch is that the game would more or less turn into Risus ... which is a fine game, but it has a different purpose and goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410156/#Comment_410156" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-22T16:59:52+00:00" title="March 22, 2013  4:59PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The difference (and I'm only talking from having read Smallville here) is that the skills are much more evocative.

They have different takes on how to hit target numbers and the reward resources are either plot points or bennies but at their root they are both quite similar. I agree that combat is clunky and slow but think that may be because conflict resolution systems show off what true speed is. Both need thoughtful character gen to make effective characters and can leave you unable to achieve what you thought your character was about from poor choices.<br/><br/>Cortex Plus in all it's flavours is a very different beast to Cortex, is much more a conflict resolution system (except for the Marvel flavour) and rewards playing the system tight to the roleplaying. There is a lot of crunch but a lot more leeway with using characters effectively. I don't think they've got it right yet so research what you like most before picking which one to go for, of instance Smallville is fantastic at pushing relationships but tough to get final consequences out of.<br/><br/>Fate I am still to play so would be interested to hear about. I also have it as the shadowy figure that sounds like the answer to my games need for generally GM'd games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P" title="Adrian P"><img alt="Adrian P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adrian%20P">Adrian P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410194/#Comment_410194" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T01:51:21+00:00" title="March 23, 2013  1:51AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fate Accelerated Edition is one of the spin offs from the recent Fate Core kickstarter which might address some of the crunchiness concerns.<br/><br/>It's a stripped down version of Fate which replaces skills with 'approaches' such as Flashy, Careful and Forceful.

Unfortunately I'm not really interested in any of those settings.<br/><br/>Cortex non-Plus is skewing a bit crunchier than I'd like now that I'm into the combat rules, but I think I can handle it, especially if I can find some nice cheat-sheets or GM screens to summarize all the rules about initiative, cover, damage, healing...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410232/#Comment_410232" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T11:58:04+00:00" title="March 23, 2013 11:58AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cortex Plus Hackers Guide just comming off a successful Kickstarter and may address your needs when it's released.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_410235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410235/#Comment_410235" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-23T12:18:11+00:00" title="March 23, 2013 12:18PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Cortex Plus Hackers Guide just comming off a successful Kickstarter and may address your needs when it's released. </blockquote>\nIt should do, as it is now due to include the setting free versions of Cortex Plus Action and Cortex Plus Drama.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_410294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/410294/#Comment_410294" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-24T06:09:39+00:00" title="March 24, 2013  6:09AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 24, 2013 6:10AM by semajmaharg.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Fate Accelerated Edition is one of the spin offs from the recent Fate Core kickstarter which might address some of the crunchiness concerns.<br/><br/>It's a stripped down version of Fate which replaces skills with 'approaches' such as Flashy, Careful and Forceful.

My only criticism of the approaches, um, approach is that I'm not fully sold on the six key words they've given them - but that's clearly the simplest hack going if you want to change it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
