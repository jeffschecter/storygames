(That shouldn't be a surprise, but still...)  So, I'd like to try an experiment, and so it's clear what I'm looking for, I'll use the blockquote thing the kids are crazy about:\n<blockquote><strong>Whisper</strong> to me in this thread your answer to this question:  What is an "ashcan" game?<br/>Also, let me know if I have your permission to repost your comment once this part of the experiment is over.  If not, that's totally cool, and I still would love to get your opinion.  Edit: Please let me know one way or the other, though, so I don't have to whisper back asking you.</blockquote>\nI'm looking for whispered comments because if the Internet has taught us anything, it's that an open discussion about asking for opinions results in other people arguing over those opinions to the point of starting up a flame war, all the while the OP is getting frustrated that progress isn't being made.  I want comments with as little additional bias as possible, so that I might better see where various folks stand.  If you're not interested in whispering your opinion to me, I ask that you hold off for now and wait until the next part of the experiment.<br/><br/>To be clear: I don't care if you agree or disagree with anything I've had to say about ashcans or my own ashcan -- I'm just looking for your opinion.  While this might be a touchy subject for some, I'll do my best to keep it from getting heated on my end.  (Which, again, is why the whispering.)<br/><br/>Thank you!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_117768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/117768/#Comment_117768" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-03T13:10:24+00:00" title="January  3, 2008  1:10PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sweet!

I'm still looking for more, but I want to add one additional request (which I'll edit in the OP):  Please let me know if I have your permission to post your response out-of-whisper once this part of the experiment is done.  That'll save me from asking every single responder for that.  Thanks!<br/><br/>(For those who have already posted, if that's cool with you, you need only to edit your answer.

In that thread, I think I'm going to re-post comments I received anonymously -- at least, those that I have been given permission to do.  The intent is to continue this experiment without introducing any more bias than I have to.  I came to this idea yesterday, and I figured I'd mention it in case that changed how people feel about me posting their reply one way or the other.<br/><br/>Thank you all again!
