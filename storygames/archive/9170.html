I know you are funny and smart and I am dumb.  So:<br/><br/>You are going to design a modular game that teaches the<b> five most essential skills </b>for playing modern/indie/narrative-focused whatever games. <br/><br/>Each of these essential skills will be the focus of a particular minigame, and is progressively introduced in play.  So maybe the first thing you learn is walking, and by minigame five (in an integrated and thematically linked series) you are using walking (maybe in a couple of nuanced ways) along with dancing, sprinting, low crawling, and you put them in the service of learning about endurance running.  <br/><br/>What are these five things?  In what order would you present them?<br/><br/>For reference, here's the stuff people thought important enough to <a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=A_Story_Games_Primer" rel="nofollow">codexify</a>:<br/><br/>    * Conflicts and Conflict Resolution<br/>    * Fanmail -- mechanics for positive reinforcement/carrots<br/>    * Fishing -- encouraging the players to provide descriptions.<br/>    * Flags<br/>    * "I'm Gonna Make You Awesome"<br/>    * Kickers and Bangs <br/>    * One-Sheet<br/>    * Relationship Maps<br/>    * "Say Yes or Roll the Dice"<br/>    * Scene Framing<br/>    * Setting Stakes <br/>    * Previews (or "Next Time On")<br/>    * Leading Questions (that build links and reveal the setting during character creation)<br/><br/>Obviously everyone will have their own answer, and many important things are not on that list.  Maybe the essential skills are timeless and universal; maybe they are specialized.  What do you think?  What are the big five, and how best could they be oriented to build on one another?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202845">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202845/#Comment_202845" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T17:51:11+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  5:51PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2009 5:51PM by J_Walton.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

I have the first game finished - it's called <i>Zombine Cinema</i>. My conclusion was that the numero uno skill I needed to teach both to newcomers and old roleplayers was taking dramatic responsibility for the entertainment value of your own character, insofar as that character was supposed to be a protagonist. Therefore the game focuses solely on character depiction and pacing a dramatic arc for your character on a topic allotted to you by random means. I also included a conflict resolution system to make the game fun, but that's just commercial necessities talking.<br/><br/>Thing is, I don't have any other core skills at this moment to teach. When I do, perhaps I'll make another game. Being able to create interesting characters and pace their issues (not resolve them in the first scene or leave them unresolved) takes you quite incredibly far, though, provided that the game has appropriate support structures for the advocation process.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202849/#Comment_202849" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T18:01:16+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  6:01PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks guys!<br/><br/>I want to make something that takes less than an hour, maybe less than half an hour, that lets someone try out a particular skill and see it in action successfully.  Then on to the next thing.  So very, very concrete things, and it is OK if not everything gets covered.  maybe there will be ways to replay them with another focus - like the "scene framing" minigame, which can focus on bangs, or on fishing, or - if you have lots of time - on both.  In the end I want a person to experience lots of good stuff in four hours and be eager to put everything they've learned to use.  <br/><br/>This happens in regular play, I know, but I want to build a pedagogy around it in  conscious way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202858/#Comment_202858" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T19:10:56+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  7:10PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Of the things you listed, since you're aiming to pare it down to five, I'd say combine:<br/><br/>Conflict and Resolution, Setting Stakes, Say Yes or Roll<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>Flags, Fanmail, and Kickers and Bangs<br/><br/>Scene Framing is kind of its own thing but leads to good conflicts.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202867">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards" title="C_Edwards"><img alt="C_Edwards" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/C_Edwards">C_Edwards</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202867/#Comment_202867" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T21:44:38+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  9:44PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 20, 2009 9:45PM by C_Edwards.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) Confidence in Improvisational Imagining (which probably includes "Fishing" and "I'm Gonna Make You Awesome!")<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Drama: What Makes a Story a Story (how and why to make conflict important, including "Kickers and Bangs", "Scene Framing", and "Flags")<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Conflict for $1000 (when and how to use conflict resolution, "Setting Stakes, "Say Yes or Roll the Dice")<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Techniques for the Road (Simple ways to help make the first three steps go somewhere, positive reinforcement mechanics, "Relationship Maps", "Leading Questions", other important techniques usable in the game.)<br/>\n<br/>\n5) The Show (bringing everything else together with Color, player buy-in, enthusiasm, and grace.

The method/minigame: "HAY GUYZ here is some pregenerated characters, let's not worry about the world too much right now, let's just play it a session and see how it goes"<br/><br/>2 - The goal: Define your character's place in the story. The minigame: "Okay, that's how it works, here is the broad, birds-eye view of this story, let's talk about the characters you want to play, generate them and screw around with them a little bit so you get a taste for them."  (This is probably worth breaking down into smaller pieces but the head-crashingly screaming meltdown of trying to work out procedures that will permit the design-at-start people to start playing while not forcing the design-in-play people to scream "I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DO" is above my pay grade. But character generation as minigame has a long and storied history for a good reason.)<br/><br/>3.  The goal: Establish a clear character voice.  Method: "Here is an in-game event of significant import. Just play your character. You can talk like them, or describe what they're doing, but we're not going to pop back out to the game system  nearly as fast in this bit."  Added bonus if it is an in-game meal and you get everyone to do the same thing together.  Design for this prior to 1.<br/><br/>4.  The goal: deconstruct something. Not sure on this mini-game, signalling what you want deconstructed is tough.<br/><br/>5.  The goal: change your character in some significant way.  This one is also tough for me to get a minigame for, XP works in some systems but is rarely of any great narrative import and isn't really much of an answer to the OP's question. Maybe playing some other character other than your own? I donno.<br/><br/>Anyway, cool topic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202875/#Comment_202875" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T22:43:02+00:00" title="April 20, 2009 10:43PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1.

It'd be one game, with different phases, rather than several different minigames.<br/><br/><i>Setting up</i><br/><br/>Make a character.<br/><br/>Also choose a general theme you want to address.<br/><br/><i>1. Building on each other's ideas and fan mail</i><br/><br/>So, in this phase you just have lots of scenes where the characters interact. It's a sort of getting-to-know-you, relationship-map-building phase.<br/><br/>Give a die to someone else when they build on something you said or did. You roll these dice at the end of every scene: successes are evens, say. They work like in Breaking The Ice: it's co-operative and, if you get enough successes, the whole group gets a Story Point. (Story Point is a really bad name, but you know what I mean. It's a collective thing and the whole group wants to build Story Points).<br/><br/><i>3. Driving to conflict, with a little bit of stake-setting</i> <br/><br/>In this phase, you also get dice if you provide opposition or conflict. Scenes now end in a conflict. You roll your dice; the other person rolls their dice; highest number wins.<br/><br/><i>And</i>, as before, if you get enough even numbers, the whole group gets a Story Point. So you've got that collaborative thing going on under the competition.<br/><br/>Oh, and retconning! The outcome of any conflict must be fun. If someone in the group thinks the outcome isn't fun - like the classic "You fail to pick the lock" - you must go back and make it fun.<br/><br/><i>3. Scene framing and Director Stance</i><br/><br/>Same as before, but now you can narrate stuff about the world. More generally, you can narrate stuff in Director Stance: so not just "My character goes into the bar" but "My character goes into the bar. There's a smell of stale beer and tobacco. The barman looks up at me."<br/><br/>You get dice for doing that, of course.<br/><br/>Now, you can't start your own scene. Someone else has to frame it for you and they get dice for doing that.<br/><br/>Everything else is as before: conflicts and so forth. Oh, perhaps, now scenes don't <i>have</i> to end in a conflict. They can just end in a roll for Story Points.<br/><br/><i>4. Themes</i><br/><br/>Now you get dice for addressing the theme you decided during set-up.<br/><br/>Otherwise, same as before, conflicts, roll for Story Points.<br/><br/><i>5.

Everyone can go around the table and experiment with different questions and discuss how the answers to those questions would make people awesome. It'd be easy to work Fanmail related stuff into that too.<br/><br/>"Say Yes or Roll the Dice" is less vital if you build a collaborative atmosphere in the first place. I look to "Say Yes" as an admonition for traditional gamers to break out of old habits, and would be less necessary on a tabula rasa. Still a small note about focusing on the positive would not go amiss.<br/><br/>Now that leading questions of awesomeness are established, if things are going well conflicts should be readily apparent. Everyone can go around the table and propose how their characters can use the answers to these questions to cause conflicts. Once everyone's got some juicy conflicts, they're going to be itching to find out how it plays out.<br/><br/>Go around the table and ask what everyone wants out of their juicy new conflicts. This is a great opportunity to train people to ask for what they *want* and not what they're going to *do*. I've noticed this does not come naturally to people. Many traditional gamers say only what they're doing and keep what they want hidden, for fear of the GM using it "against" them. Newbie players simply don't know how to ask, and it's easier to just say something you're doing than say what you're wanting.<br/><br/>Once we know what everybody wants, it's time to start setting stakes. Skilled stake setting can totally make or break a game, and I honestly think this is one of the hardest things to learn. I don't believe any game will get new players acclimated to this idea in just one session. It's going to take practice. I wish I had more advice for this part, but I'm still relatively new at the concept myself. I know just enough to recognize how important it is. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Once stakes have been set, there should be a very fast and simple resolution system which leaves room for negotiation. In A Wicked Age is just about perfect for this (well, except that it doesn't really use stake setting). But perhaps just a straight roll-off and then the greater the difference between rolls, the more one side must compromise, with a tie roll presenting the very interesting challenge of "everybody gets all of or neither of what they want, figure out how that works in the narrative." Something I still struggle with.<br/><br/>Each person will go through this conflict once per "round". Make a character, help others do the same, encourage positive reinforcement, think up conflicts, think up stakes, negotiate outcomes. Rinse, wash, repeat. Try different settings and genres to give people ideas about how different scenes can arise from these factors. Do a romance in space, a shootout at the Coral, an argument with an archmage at the Well of Souls, and running from a knife wielding maniac in the dark and scary woods. <br/><br/>I'd say give it 5 sessions or so and most people will be ready to try all the funky dice mechanics and settings of indie gaming. There's still much to learn, of course, and always will be, but I believe the above would be a solid foundation I wish I myself could have had.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202947/#Comment_202947" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T09:41:30+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  9:41AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: kevin.weiser</cite>"Say Yes or Roll the Dice" is less vital if you build a collaborative atmosphere in the first place.

Run through a couple cycles and then switch who does what.<br/><br/>For example, if we're talking about a "conflict resolution" game, you tell one person to come up with the bang, one person to set stakes, and one person to interpret/narrate the outcome. You run through a couple cycles---maybe in the context of and an actual scene, or maybe just as a long string of conflicts---keeping everyone doing the same task. Then, after a bit, rotate jobs, rinse repeat until everyone has had a go at each task.<br/><br/>Hmm, here's a couple possible add-ons: Assign each person a "goal" or "theme" or something. Like, "tie your job to one of the character's issues" or "make your job as dark as possible". The players then keep that "goal" or whatever throughout the entire game, even while they switch up tasks.<br/><br/>If we're still talking about the "conflict resolution" game, you could make each scene just a series of conflicts, and then switch jobs as you cut and re-frame.<br/><br/>You could also start with a "static" set-up---the same characters, situation, etc---and just watch how different stuff happens depending on who gets what task and what "goals" everyone has (maybe have a whole bunch that get randomly assigned).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202978/#Comment_202978" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T10:51:52+00:00" title="April 21, 2009 10:51AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I really like that, Tim.

Let's look at Snyder's suggested progression there.<br/><br/>So it's a game where you rescue a princess from a castle of evil.  <br/><br/>Part 1:  PCs are functionally identical.  Everybody describes their guy.  Everybody adds a detail based on what the previous person described.<br/>Part 2:  You've got guys, you have to get to the castle.  There are challenges that require paying attention to GM environmental cues to avoid traps, owlbears, etc.  So listening + conflict resolution.<br/>Part 3:  You're in the castle.  Everybody authors a bang for another guy's dude based on what they have learned about that guy, and each bang leads into a challenge scene.  So listening + conflict res + bangs.<br/>Part 4:  You're in the dungeon beneath the castle.  You can smell the princess!  The GM throws out some Fishing to flesh out the dungeon.  Everybody heightens GM narration for each other.  More conflicts!  Princess rescued?  <br/>Part 5:  Back in the village, you form an adventurers band!  Characters are fleshed out communally, absent ownership.  Not sure how the other techniques fit in here, but hopefully you get the idea how a specific technique drives each mini-game bit, and how they could be interchanged, and how they build on one another.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202990/#Comment_202990" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T11:38:19+00:00" title="April 21, 2009 11:38AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 21, 2009 12:19PM by komradebob.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Part 5 could also be an epilogue about how they all lived , presumably, Happily Ever After (Or perhaps not so happily, or at least not peacefully.), with a preset list questions about the characters which the players choose from. A form of group fishing maybe? Possibly some sort of Bang! creation as well. Certainly it puts fiction creation out to the group. I suppose it might even be a form of pacing as well, with events leaping forward over years or decades.<br/><br/>Kind of like that last episode of the TV show about that family that owned the funeral parlor, the name of which i can never remember.<br/><br/>Edit:<br/><i>Six Feet Under</i><br/><br/>Wikipedia knows all, Wikipedia sees all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202999">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202999/#Comment_202999" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T12:16:58+00:00" title="April 21, 2009 12:16PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason, that's quite good. I probably did a really lousy job thinking through my five sequentially. How you made sense out of them like that I'll never know! But, it produced a surprisingly cool step (step 5, that is).<br/><br/>Not to spoil the idea, but here's my revised list that makes a bit more sense with what I was thinking: <br/><br/>1) Creating characters together <br/>2) Listening<br/>3) Narration &amp; Suggestions<br/>4) Bangs &amp; Other Situations<br/>5) Conflict Resolution<br/><br/>It occurs to me now that these are indeed 5 crucial "indie" things in my view. But, that they lack a huge, huge component. How do rewards fit into these steps? I'm sure anyone who made a game/experiment from these five would inevitably (perhaps unconsciously) come up with such rewards, but I didn't put it there. Huh. Whaddya know.<br/><br/>Here's my stab at a narrative like yours: <br/><br/>1) Everyone makes up characters together. You'll feed off one another, and also sometimes steer clear of ideas because someone else is obviously more interested. That's ok. What's your character like? What are the others like? More importantly, what to the characters think about each other? Neat.<br/>2) Now, listen to what everyone wants to do with these characters. You're all invested by now. If no one has ideas, why are you playing? What are you playing? Chance are, everyone has ideas, they're just not sure how to communicate them. That means you have to listen harder. What? You want to save the princess in a castle? Great. Let's get started.<br/>3) Who has an idea for how to get started? So, Bob does? And Betty does too? Ok. But, those both don't make sense. Ok, let's roll. Too bad, Bob. We're going with Betty's idea. The buck stops there. Bob, what do you mean you like her idea about disguising ourselves as an owlbear carnival better anyway? Great!<br/>4) Look, the love fest is over, ok Bob and Betty? That's because the owlbears are all dead the next morning. NOW WHAT?!?<br/>5) Ok, Betty, that's fine. Look, roll some dice, ok? Let's find out if you can get revenge on the owlbear assassins after all.<br/><br/>etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203005/#Comment_203005" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T13:08:26+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  1:08PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I had to scratch my head at the way you ordered your steps, but I just knew you had it all under control...<br/><br/>I think we're getting somewhere with all this.

I guess part of it is the step away from older rpgs I played, where it seemed like there was an attempt at mechanically modelling a game world ( I think the older term I've heard is "physics engine"). With that style of mechanics, there's a sort of socially protective layer between the players and the text that can ( sometimes) be used to excuse away responsibility for the direction things take. <br/><br/>With S-Gs, that isn't as true. Rarely is there any sort of random event table or similar to fall back on and point to as being responsible for whatever odd, perhaps unpleasant, thing that just came up. It's very much in the laps of the people actually playing.<br/><br/>Not sure that qualifies as any sort of core technique, but it seems like something worth talking about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203035">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203035/#Comment_203035" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T15:35:03+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  3:35PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that that's particularly germane to this exercise, k-bob.

If I go to my friends and say "Let's play this game about a princess", they'll say no.<br/><br/>For example, the best beginners' game I've ever played is Poison'd. Because I say "So the assassin's there on the deck in front of you. What do you do?". And they say "I hit him!". And I say "Cool, he goes to the floor, what now?". And this goes on until someone says "Right, I slit him from stomach to throat, throw him overboard and tell everyone I'm captain". And then they suddenly get what they've got to do.<br/><br/>So it's good to talk about this in terms of skills, but it also has to work on another level, where it's fun and inspiring, and the skill-learning comes without it feeling like a lesson.<br/><br/>Not trying to argue, you understand, just pointing out another thing.<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203045">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203045/#Comment_203045" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T16:01:48+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  4:01PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Graham said is rather good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_203048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203048/#Comment_203048" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-21T16:36:35+00:00" title="April 21, 2009  4:36PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it's all right, isn't it?

Each of you have lots of coins or pearls or diamonds in a pocket.<br/><br/>- Approach another player. Try to meet him in a positive way.<br/>- For each player you will try out different smiles, different stances, different ways of saying hello and shaking hands (or the like).<br/>- When the greetings are done with, you will say something fantastic to the other player. He will respond in an eaqually fantastic way. You may make up any kind of <i>fantastica</i>, and may vary it it any way you like. <br/>- If the two of you exchange fantastica in a way that connects, a way that enables you to share some common fantasy, then you may give each other a token of appreciation (your coins/pearls/diamonds).<br/><br/>- After a while you may want to meet two other players at once, and exchange fantastica with them.<br/>- Shake hands, be friendly, and respond in kind to their fantastica. Be careful to build on their fantastica all the time. <br/>- If the three of you succeed in creating a common fantasy, then you may reward each other with tokens.<br/><br/>- If all players meet at one point, and start exchanging fantastica, and do that successfully, then you may reward each of the other players with a token (as they will reward you).<br/>- If the whole group succeed in exchanging fantastica, then the game is over.

If the goal is to teach a particular game it's going to look different than if the goal is an introduction and lesson in collaboration and role-playing games in general.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor what I think is an organic and more general approach, I'd start with the "Listen, Asking Questions, and Giving People What They Want" section. Start off with freeform improvisational roleplaying, get the players listening to each other, and build confidence, and the basics of playing well together.<br/>\n<br/>\nNext I'd go to "Real People at a Real Table". Get explicit with what was implicit in the first stage. Demonstrate (possibly using examples of play from the previous stage) how distributing authority and drawing explicit lines for collaboration, contributing, and negotiating benefits play. Add in fanmail type rewards (that maybe let you do something in the fiction without permission or negotiation). Keep building confidence, trust, and respect.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen move on to "Structuring a Narrative". Now that the players are playing well with each other (let's hope), show them how to make the fiction they're creating together kick all ass. Keep reinforcing the material and techniques from the previous stages.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly go to "Resolution". The players will have been resolving actions in the fiction using the base principles in the earlier stages. Now it's time to show them how hard rules, and mechanics, for resolution can benefit play (by cutting down on negotiation time, add tension, etc.), and also show the bones of conflict and how and when to approach it and resolve it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThrough each stage various pieces of the particular game and/or setting can be introduced, so you are simultaneously building players as well as a game for them to play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203303/#Comment_203303" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T11:29:49+00:00" title="April 23, 2009 11:29AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas, I'd love to see you develop a set of four more games using your initial principles to accompany this one.<br><br>Chris, you're right.

Part of the issue seems to be---from my perspective on the other side of the computer screen---is that I don't think you've really develop what you want the focus of this project to be.<br><br>Who's your audience? The skills you need to teach a random non-gamer off the streets is different from an old skool gamer with entrench gaming habits.<br><br>Do you want to teach "meta" skills (like those that relate to communication or general story building), or do you want to teach technique-specific skills (like setting stakes, kickers, etc). Or for that matter, do you want to teach CA-specific skills or stuff that's applicable across the role-playing spectrum (some of the stuff mentioned in this thread is more applicable to thematic-play than in other styles).<br><br>Also, what exactly do you mean by "teaching game"? There are at least two possibilities I see. One might be a "play tutorial", where the goal is teach totally new skills. The other might be a "practice drill", where the goal is more to help a player become better at what they already do. Optimizing these games for either one of those is going to lead to different play structures.<br><br>Furthermore, I think you need to decide whether you want this to be an actual "game" (something that resembles a full-fledge RPG or improv performance), or whether you want it to be more like a "training exercise" (something that's obviously contrived to focus play on a particular play task).<br><br>If we're still in just the "thought experiment" stage, I'll give you my opinion on what type of focus I think would be most useful. But I really think those questions should be answer before anything else happens.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_203360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203360/#Comment_203360" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-23T22:17:56+00:00" title="April 23, 2009 10:17PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Jason.

Right now I think I want:<br/><br/>1.  Discrete one hour play experiences that are satisfying and fun on their own...<br/>2.  ... that can be combined into a full session that presents a coherent one-shot ...<br/>3 ... that can be customized to focus on learning, practicing, or reinforcing particular techniques.<br/><br/>Since I haven't tried to actually <i>write </i>any of this, I may be way off, but that's what I'm thinking.  In my imagination, this would be a resource for people to try stuff out - so if a guy's like "what's fishing?" you could point him to Part III of Super Baskerville Fun Stomp and encourage him to try it out with the fishing module.  He gets an hour of concentrated fishing practice in addition to your sage advice and references to old Forge threads.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_203508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203508/#Comment_203508" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T23:42:46+00:00" title="April 24, 2009 11:42PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>My take:<br/><br/>1.<b>Acceptance</b>(how to build a constructive attitude for interactive imagination, and other intense human interactions)<br/>2.<b>Talking and singing</b>(how to use a normal voice in wonderful ways, and how to make great dialogue simple)<br/>3.<b>Theme dancing</b>(how to introduce theme, frame conflicts and find consequences, and weave intrigues on this basis)<br/>4.<b>Mechanics galore</b>(mechanics from modern games, what points and dice and other fiddly bits to use, and to what purpose)<br/>5.<b>Happiness</b>(the social, emotional and intellectual content of gaming, the heavens of human interaction)</blockquote>\nA sketch for the next game coming up here ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_203509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203509/#Comment_203509" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-24T23:43:03+00:00" title="April 24, 2009 11:43PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2009 11:53PM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My take, game 2:<br/><br/><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><b>TALKING and SINGING<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span></b><br/><i>- how to use a normal voice in wonderful ways, and how to make great dialogue simple</i><br/><br/>The voice is a wonderful instrument. We use it every day, and may fill it with meaning and emotions with next to no effort. This ease in dialogue is possible in roleplaying games too. My little game is all about that.<br/><br/>You need 4-10 players, and a sturdy, clean table big enough for all of you to stand around it (remove any chairs). You may read one section of this game at a time, play it out according to the instructions, and then read the next section. Or you may read it all, and play it (reading to remind you at need).<br/><br/><b>The warm up</b><br/>Stand around the table. Make sounds. Not words. Not a song. Only sounds. Do it for five minutes.<br/><br/><b>The birth</b><br/>Sit down beside the table. This is the phase where your character is born. Your "character" is the fictional personality you will form in this game, outside yourself, but still growing from your hearth. Be sure to have your hearth in it. Forget all skepticism and restraints. go with the flow.<br/><br/>You giveth birth to your character by slowly raising your head over the rim of the table, while making his first sounds. You do not have to start this immediately. You may sit a bit first, listening to the other characters being born. When you give birth to your character, you will make careful sounds, not words. Your sounds may resemble a song, if your character is born in harmony. If not, they may be anything (but words). Raise slowly, so you have the time to get a feel with your character, and for the benefit of your fellow players.<br/><br/>Continue the birth until you stand erect beside the table. Then you silence your song, and concentrate on the other births. <br/><br/><b>The naming</b><br/>When all characters is born, you will start naming them. You will name other things too, and while naming things you will communicate with your fellow charaters; telling them names you find, repeating the names they are saying, learning of eachother, creating a dialogue of names, filling the names with a variety of emotional content.<br/><br/>You may involve any and all other characters in your dialogue, making a small chorus of names of it. some names you will understand, and some you will only hear as strange syllables. This is how the world is to your character; partly beginning to make sense, and partly strange shades in a vast darkness.<br/><br/>When you feel like it, you may indicate yourself, and give a name that is for your character only. Be prepared to fight for it, if you must, or to celebrate it, if you feel like it. Your name may be anything, from <i>Kachoo </i>to <i>Teasoul </i>and further on.<br/><br/><b>The bonding</b><br/>When you have named yourself you continue the dialogue, but now you will try to bond with the other characters in varying ways. Make them friends, or mentors, or fellow explorers, or kindredsouls in passion. All of this will be expressed in sounds, names and singing.<br/><br/>It is indeed appropriate to sing when a bond is created, but no song is to be impressing or professional or anything like an aria. Songs in this game are small and unassuming, not always in tune, not always "songs" in the conventional meaning of the word. Your character may sing any way he likes, as long as you let your character celebrate the bonds with some sort of "singing" sounds.<br/><br/>if you sound like a whale, it is perfect. if you sound like a mouse, it is perfect. If you sound like barking dog with soar throath, is if all too perfect. It will be part of your character, so let it be whatever comes out of you. It is your character you are singing!<br/><br/>Adn you will sing with other characters too, celebrating with them the bonds between you by repeating their songs to you in your way, expressiing the joy of fellowship, the gladdened eyes upon you, and the open voices of yourself and your friends.<br/><br/><b>The telling</b><br/>Now you will all cooperate in telling a tale about your characters;<br/>- how they gather to explore the world<br/>- how they overcome difficulties and grow stronger by it, as a group<br/>- and how they in the end encounter a great monster someone have named<br/><br/>In the battle with the monster you will all sing, with sounds and words and names. You will take heroic stances and sing your attacs on the monster, your failures, your successes, and the damage you get. You will all share in this singing attack on the monster, until one of you sacrifices himself to end the monster.<br/><br/>Then you will all shout a final attack-song to the ceiling, as a group of raging and triumphing animals. Make it strong and short, and end it abruptly. Death has been achieved, and death has claimed one of your own ...<br/><br/><b>The elegy</b><br/>The character who sacrificed himself to save you all from the monster, will now lay on his back on the table.<br/><br/>You will reach out and touch him for the first time. Place your hands on his legs, arms, stomach, chest and forehead. Do not tickle or make fun of this. Be calm and respectful.<br/><br/>From the silence of sorrow your elegy will rise. Make soft sounds, placating, forgiving, softly encouraging. Let an elegy form from these sounds, and join the other characters in this elegy. Give voice to your sorrow, and join in the sorrow of the others. Do not sing out loud, do not shout, but make it more of a calm prayer for the soul of the character. And when the elegy has gone its course, let it die. Be still. Be quiet.<br/><br/>When all is quiet, the character on the table may have his soul rise from this world, with the sound of his soul. Make that sound for all of the characxters,a nd for the game. And then be quiet.<br/><br/><i>The game is over. You may rise, hug, talk, give thanks for the game, and have a nice evening.</i></span> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_203888">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/203888/#Comment_203888" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-28T13:40:21+00:00" title="April 28, 2009  1:40PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason,<br/>I really like your breakdown of 4 categories with subtopics.  Of these, I think <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is the weakest and least coherent.  I think <b>Structuring a Narrative</b> is fantastic as laid out, and I want to play it and learn right now.  I also see little to improve upon with <b>Resolution</b>, although some IIEE-type "when?" discussion of integrating mechanics &amp; fiction might belong here if not covered earlier elsewhere.<br/><br/><b>Real People at a Real Table</b> seems like a great intro, and the list of topics looks cool, but I'm not sure how far one gets toward actual RPG play here.  My impression is that the answer is "quite far" (what with specifics like retconning mentioned), but I think it's hard to do that without simultaneously covering the stuff you've put in <b>Listening, Asking Questions, and Giving People What They Want</b>.  Basically, I think the material covered in these two minigames could benefit from some clearer separation and framing -- whether that turns the material into one game, two games, or five, I don't know.<br/><br/>Quick stab:<br/><br/><b>Real People at a Real Table</b><br/>Lumpley Principle \u2013 system is bigger than you think<br/>The social contract and metagame \u2013 establishing standards and objectives<br/>Collaborating, contributing, and negotiating<br/>Confidence, trust, safety and respect<br/>Don\u2019t be a dick<br/>Ritual<br/>Rewards (large scale)<br/><b><br/>Establishing Shared Imaginings</b><br/>Aesthetic standards - outside-of-play references, inspiration, etc.<br/>Authority - Types (content, plot, situation, etc.)<br/>Authority - Methods (GM, player, mechanics, fiction, etc.)<br/>Narration and different types of speech (provisional, performative, IC, OOC, etc.)<br/>Scene Framing<br/>Making mistakes, retconning, building on them<br/>Color \u2013 Make the world a memorable place<br/><br/><b>Cumulative Collaboration</b><br/>Attitude \u2013 helping each other be awesome<br/>Listening and Flags \u2013 give your friends what they want<br/>Agreement and building on input \u2013 accept the gifts you are given and make them better<br/>Fishing \u2013 Ask your friends to provide interesting things<br/>Reincorporation \u2013 Re-use what\u2019s already appeared in a new way.<br/><br/><b>Structuring a Narrative</b><br/>etc.<br/><br/>The stuff I lumped in <b>Establishing Shared Imaginings</b> is universal to roleplaying, and may apply less to story-gaming than other types of RPG play.  But I think it's very similar to the other stuff you list, in that it's often both poorly grasped and vital to successful play.<br/><br/>I have one last suggestion: I think each minigame needs to use or at least clearly cover some sort of reward mechanism/cycle.  Real People at a Real Table would address the largest-scale rewards of play (stuff like "have fun together"), while other minigames would address more specific, small-scale rewards, found in some games but not others.  Fanmail would go in the <b>Cumulative Collaboration</b> minigame, immersion-based stuff would go in <b>Establishing Shared Imaginings</b>, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>The Progressive Teaching Game - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9170/the-progressive-teaching-game/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="The Progressive Teaching Game - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/9170/the-progressive-teaching-game/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="That's good stuff, Dave.

I talked it over with him, and eventually he sang for us, the muu-song. It took us half an hour to make him do it, but when he did, he made the most beautiful muu-song ever. He expressed our clumsiness as well as his own, and through his immature singing-voice he expressed the muu too, a creature that rarely use it's voice (but when it do, it is singing). <br/><br/>To be clumsy in singing is to be beautiful, to be frail and human, to be one of the ordinary men and women of our world.
