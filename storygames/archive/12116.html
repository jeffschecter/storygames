While fun, the session felt a bit flat to me.  I'd put the two main causes down to:<br/><br/>1) My Geiger Counter alpha-style experiment of having everyone make up two characters (for a total of ten), each with their own Goals, and then to have people decide on and indicate which of their two characters was a potential survivor only some time after they'd each been in a scene.  I wanted each of the ten characters to have a little depth before they were killed but I don't think there's really enough time for that.<br/><br/>2) Even with the fair amount of pre-production we'd done prior to game day, we kicked some historical facts around for a while to get everyone on the same page.  I then sped too quickly through the rules because I could see my above experiment was going to cause us to be short on time.  Even so, we had to rush through the last third of the movie pretty quickly to wrap things up in our four-hour window.<br/><br/>I had a bunch of old shot glasses, a cold pitcher of water, and a half a bottle of vodka (for the daring) ready to go for a flashback scene of the Russian soldiers toasting one another prior to the mission, but I didn't entertain introducing it given the way time was going.<br/><br/>I <i>do</i> still have a good deal of enthusiasm for our starting premise and for the idea of polishing up a nice style-sheet for Archangel and giving it another try.  At least a couple of the players expressed some interest in playing Archangel again.  I have in mind something more like a one-shot convention kit for an Archangel movie of Geiger Counter.  A bit like what Lady Blackbird does.  Not "get everyone together, make various pitches, settle on one, develop the scenario and characters and then play in the time you have remaining," but "Read this.  If this setup appeals to you and your group of friends, just start playing."  All the group would do would be pick their characters and assign Goals from a pre-baked list, maybe cast the actors, and then go.<br/><br/>A few things I especially enjoyed in the session:<br/><br/>Everyone flexed their PTA muscles and we had lots of great camera and sound work.  This helps my visualization of the story so much.  I have a PTA/Geiger Counter-inspired project germinating that would use cards to prompt specific kinds of shots.  People would use them as an aid to drive the narrative in some way.  Probably limited appeal; seriously geeky film nerds might dig it.  I think it would be a fun creative challenge to be forced to set your next scene as a high-angle establishing shot, forcing the players from the intense dialogue two characters were were just engaged in to an entirely new location and time.<br/><br/>The mad drunken Orthodox priest taking pot shots at us from the wooden church's bell tower, and then getting away with the church's valuable icon.<br/><br/>Ivan Federov's sacrifice manning the PM M1910 at the old barn.<br/><br/>Red Guard deserter Lev Kropotkin (Edward Norton) and Yuliya "the Valkyrie" Fedorova (Naomi Watts) driving a giant ancient bronze sword though an even more giant six-winged Nephilim demon-thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272117/#Comment_272117" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-19T16:35:59+00:00" title="May 19, 2010  4:35PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2010 4:40PM by nemomeme.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            requisite map shots:<br/><br/>Ready to play!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/uruush/4622406577/" rel="nofollow" title="IMG_2301[1] by mgagan1, on Flickr"><img alt="IMG_2301[1]" height="375" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3342/4622406577_1f0bd7d3a4.jpg" width="500"/></a><br/><br/>The Menace reaches its apex.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/uruush/4623011022/" rel="nofollow" title="IMG_2302[1] by mgagan1, on Flickr"><img alt="IMG_2302[1]" height="375" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4026/4623011022_a46d1220c8.jpg" width="500"/></a><br/><br/>My coffee table was not a great seating choice for a Geiger Counter map.

My intent was to have less "my Guy-ism" for any one of the characters per your and Ping's comments on Alpha.  I think that mostly had its intended effect as a couple people seemed a little torn on which guy to have survive, but at a heavy time cost.  Also, slightly more screen-time and depth of characters 6-10 necessarily led to slightly less screen-time and depth for characters 1-5.<br/><br/>Next time I play I think I want to have N+1 characters where N = the number of players and the player whose character is first killed can switch over to playing the character that was previously handed around.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_272350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272350/#Comment_272350" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T09:09:39+00:00" title="May 21, 2010  9:09AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 21, 2010 9:09AM by nemomeme.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I like the game plenty and will continue to play Beta, so onward with the guilty Gamma development!  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I and most of the people I've played it with (three different groups now) really enjoy the pitch/premise/character creation part of the game.  Each time, though, we've run short on time for the actual movie part.  A little like Shock, Apocalypse World, PTA, Giants and, I imagine, Archipelago II.  'Cept in those games you're often going to keep playing multiple sessions.  The actual movie part is also enjoyable but we haven't gotten to play at the suspenseful slow build pace of many of the movies in the genre.  Even if you're playing with people who've all played PTA before, the adjustment to the scene length that is probably required for a truly awesome game is just that, an adjustment.  One that probably can't be over emphasized in the game text.  Maybe the game facilitator should be given express permission to make snipping motions even for the scenes they aren't directing.<br/><br/>Given that I have similar issues with Danger Patrol that some others are not seeing as much I'm beginning to suspect that one-shots are simply not my forte.  Unlike many of the "several-cons-a-year" set in this community, 95% of my GM/facilitator experience in role-playing is within the context of multi-session games and I think I've developed a deliberate pace that is difficult to retrain.  Even the super simple, tight, and awesome Fiasco takes me closer to three-and-a-half hours than the two-and-a-half that Jason runs it at.<br/><br/>As I indicated above, I'm going to do an extended style sheet for Archangel so that it can be run more quickly.  Maybe there will be some cost in player buy-in, but with the benefit of being able to play through the movie more fully.  I hope the final draft of Geiger Counter comes with multiple movie style-sheets that people can use in the context of convention time-slots with people who haven't read the rules previously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_272417">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/272417/#Comment_272417" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-21T14:39:46+00:00" title="May 21, 2010  2:39PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was in this game and I enjoyed it quite a bit.  There was some hesitation and disconnect in the midgame, mostly centered around what the menace would be exactly and who was going to define that; we were kind of fumbling for a "no you don't, motherfucker" button a la IAWA, but without one, we ended up all framing pretty soft.  We were more afraid of the menace than our characters were!  That's just my take, though.<br/><br/>I'd dork out pretty hard on those shot-cards, Matthew, especially if they came with a flowchart suggesting what to play after what (follow up Establishing Wide-Angle with a Grim Close-Up, or whatever).<br/><br/>The acceleration of the game toward the last act was actually one of my favorite parts--it felt like we were getting the game up to near-film speed, even if we never actually did any thirty-second scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
