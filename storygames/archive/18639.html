The games I have played with foreshadowing mechanics usually use prophecy, where a player makes up something suitably vague for the GM to later incorporate and specify. One problem with that, and possibly with your mechanic, is "forcing" players in a particular direction which may not be what they had in mind. Then again that's how creative stuff happens. Can this work even in the context of a pre-set plot?<br/><br/>I do have a couple questions about your mechanic. a) Does everyone need to pick an element before a twist occurs? In your example, all the players do pick one. b) How does the GM decide when the dramatic twist happens?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418783/#Comment_418783" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T05:14:05+00:00" title="July 22, 2013  5:14AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't expect all players to pick a foreshadowed element, in fact it wouldn't make sense for some characters to pick an element, especially if they were the type who 'live in the moment'. I think the key here is that the foreshadowing doesn't guarantee a particular direction when the plot twist comes, instead it gives clues about the future...just like in a well written novel.<br/><br/>As for GM decision about when a plot twist occurs, I hadn't really thought about this. It's pretty arbitrary, but when the GM feels it's right, or when things get slow and the GM decides a twist will liven things up, they can call on one of the foreshadowing sheets (as long as the characters noted on the sheet are all present in the scene). <br/><br/>In a pre-set plot, I'd probably use the plot twist to pull the characters back on track if they deviated too far from the intended storyline, or I'd deliberately leave something vague towards the end...something that can be filled in by the foreshadowed event.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V" title="Tore_V"><img alt="Tore_V" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tore_V">Tore_V</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418785/#Comment_418785" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T07:00:58+00:00" title="July 22, 2013  7:00AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've successfully used foreshadowing a number of times. The important thing to remember is that foreshadowing is a tool to introduce a story element, in detail, yet hidden. A foreshadowing must never reveal how, where, when, who, why and what. <br/>Only shadows.<br/>For instance, the foreshadowing may reveal that someone will die, maybe even who, and maybe even the how, but never everything. it must always be open to interpretation, and yet what is actually shown must be literal and happen or be introduced to the story. It must happen as shown, hence the importance of leaving an openening to introduce the element/event/object/person.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418800/#Comment_418800" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T10:52:11+00:00" title="July 22, 2013 10:52AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 22, 2013 10:52AM by JasonT.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a really interesting idea. Just to make sure I follow: Is it the <i>GM</i> who describes all these little details in the setting, and then the players then decide what to ascribe value to down the line? (GM: "It's a harsh landscape, with a car burning off the roadside..." Dave: "I'm calling that a dramatic twist. I draw green.") Or do you envision the <i>players</i> inventing specific elements themselves, based on a more vague context supplied by the GM? (GM: "It's a harsh landscape, with wreckage all about." Dave: "I notice a burning car off the side of the road \u2013 a sign of things to come. I'm calling it a dramatic twist. I draw green.")<br/><br/>I'm not sure why I even want to ask this, but I know the "official" answer would really matter to some of my players. I still have some players who insist upon asking "what's in here?" instead of more leading questions that would give them more control (no matter how much we play games that strongly encourage the latter). I suspect the basic foreshadowing system would support either approach, though, and permitting both approaches might take some of the pressure off the GM to constantly inject details on the off chance that something catches a player's ear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418827/#Comment_418827" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-22T15:45:59+00:00" title="July 22, 2013  3:45PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was specifically thinking of allowing both approaches. <br/><br/>This is because I've dealt with passive players who might consider picking something that catches their attention to future focus in the game, and active players who are always trying to inject their own thoughts in a story.

I have played plenty of games where the GM's just don't seem capable of ad-libbing or deviating from a very strict story path. <br/><br/>I'd love to work out a way to open up these GMs to a more collaborative style of play.

When a player picks something for the GM to reincorporate, the players knows those are the options, and might offer some related thoughts.  The GM then has (1) expectations set from the beginning, (2) an eye out for what might make a fun M/M/O, (3) three options to look at (M/M/O) when figuring out how to reincorporate a given element, and (4) possibly help from players, whose jobs are also made easier by knowing what they hope to find.<br/><br/><b>Provide some charts or roll-on tables</b> for the GM to use in converting <b>player input</b> into <b>What's Going On</b> -- e.g. using entries like "yes, but with an innocent explanation", "no, and it's the opposite of what they suspect", "this is the key to unlocking the problem's solution", "this is an elaborate ruse by a scheming antagonist", etc.<br/><br/><b>Make the players generate lots of theories from which the GM may choose.</b>  Example from <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r2DrTvAnfp4_wGPfYqkQQ6t2EZo9lxjvBkNad-rsR3A/edit?pli=1" rel="nofollow">my Game Chef game</a>:\n<blockquote><b>Question or intent:</b> Is your Mole attempting to learn about the Interlopers?

Once you hit 18, you should be getting a handle on the gist of what the Interlopers are up to, because the next two truths they find will reveal the whole deal!  19 should leave one question remaining, and 20 will answer it!</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418989">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid" title="vulpinoid"><img alt="vulpinoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vulpinoid">vulpinoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418989/#Comment_418989" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T02:30:33+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  2:30AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually do a lot of these things in my game <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/91382/FUBAR-%28Directors-Cut%29" rel="nofollow">FUBAR</a>, and Walkabout is a descendent of that game. <br/><br/>In that game, I require players to provide an NPC (who acts as direct antagonist to one of the other characters), a scene, a macguffin and a secret conspiracy group; but since these are shuffled and not revealed before play, none of the players know what will come next, they only that they're ideas will come up at some stage. I was actually trying to move toward a more traditional narrative structure with this game, but something that still retains a free-flowing collaborative spirit. The foreshadowing system is designed to be a mechanism that reflects a common narrative technique but makes it more collaborative.<br/><br/>I think that the way Walkabout uses different token colours to flavour action results could be used to advantage here (white is bad, black is good, green implies growth/improvement, blue implies change, red implies erosion/destruction). In the clarification and playtest examples I've already described a bit about how these colours might apply to the foreshadowed elements, but they could be integrated into the colour system further. <br/><br/>I guess I'll only know how well it works once it hits play with a few different groups (probably at the next convention where I run the game again).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418992/#Comment_418992" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-25T05:54:11+00:00" title="July 25, 2013  5:54AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FUBAR sounds nifty!

Any play reports out there?<br/><br/>More on-topic: are my suggestions too wacky and FUBAR-like for Walkabout?
