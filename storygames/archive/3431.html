I'm not humble in the way that would make me hold back.<br/>\n<br/>\nContrariwise, if I <i>don't</i> have any strong thoughts for a setting, I often say to myself "Well!  Of course, if I don't have any strong thoughts I don't want to step on anyone's toes ... they might well have an idea!  I'll just leave it to them."<br/>\n<br/>\nBut the more I game, the more I see groups all taking this tack, and doing a sort of hilarious little Chip and Dale routine about setting ... "After you, I insist!"  "Oh no, I couldn't possibly, you go ahead!"  "You're very kind, but really, I don't mind, have at it!"<br/>\n<br/>\nYou've got to imagine it with the chipmunk voices, or it doesn't get across my amusement.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn college my friends did this about restaurants.  "How 'bout chinese?"  "Chinese is good ... but I wouldn't mind sandwiches either, if you prefer," "You want sandwiches?"  "No, I'm just saying if YOU want sandwiches..."  In ... furiating.

I suspect, in fact, that my next game system will have a complete setting ... even though I don't give a damn at this moment what setting it is.

The purpose of the setting is not to create all of the world, it is to create a ... groundwork? process? mango? ... to which people can apply in-game when they want to create a part of the world.<br/><br/>I'm reminded (geekily enough) of a <i>Farscape</i> episode where aliens put Crichton in a fictional world made from his own memories ... and he figures out that's what it is, but can't get out because his memories provide them enough material to just keep extending the world anywhere he goes.  Ends up heading into the women's bathroom, on the basis that it's a place he can walk to but which he has <i>no damn clue</i> how to visualize.  Anyway, I thought it was funny :-)<br/><br/>The thing is, somebody has to make the first axioms, and that person risks making something that other people don't like.  Yeah, they can veto, but ... socially awkward moment in any event.  I used to think of someone who unilaterally did that (whether it's the game text or a player) as hogging the spotlight, but I'm more inclined, as time goes on, to think of them as performing an important ice-breaking service.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77429/#Comment_77429" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T07:17:31+00:00" title="June 25, 2007  7:17AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Argh.

We've all got characters ready, we've got a great premise for a story that's going to lead to all sorts of tasty conflicts, and we're all excited to start writing... but we just can't seem to nail down enough setting details to get started. Everyone's hesitant to actually <i>commit</i> to anything; it's just "hmm, well, maybe we could think about possibly doing something like <i>this</i>, or something.

Can we get started now?" But in this situation, I'm the "new guy" (everyone else has written together for years before; I was just briefly involved in the last project, which fell apart due to lack of planning) and I've already done a lot of organizational "GM-type" work: coming up with the initial premise, setting up and administering the wiki/message board we're playing on, drawing up posting guidelines, etc. (<i>Plus,</i> I was at least partially responsible for one player quitting the game in a huff before we even got started!) <br/><br/>If I were to just write up a setting all on my own and say "<i>this</i> is where the game takes place, deal with it!", I'd not only feel like I was this interloper trying to come in and take everything over, I'd also be annoyed that I was doing way more than my fair share of the work, especially considering that one of our goals was for everyone to have an equal say in deciding stuff so that everyone was equally invested in the project.<br/><br/>OK, this isn't exactly a helpful post, is it? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77464">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77464/#Comment_77464" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T10:29:19+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 10:29AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 10:29AM by Sydney Freedberg.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite> The purpose of the setting is not to create all of the world, it is to create a ... groundwork? process? mango? ... to which people can apply in-game when they want to create a part of the world.</blockquote>\n"Process."

Yeah, they can veto, but ... socially awkward moment in any event....</blockquote>\nExcept that you're thinking of providing a canned setting of some kind with <i>Misery Bubblegum</i>, right? And in fact a light built-in setting is the default for a wide range of Indie games -- notably <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, whose setting elements are by the way entirely written in seed-crystal images and generative rules. So you, as the <i>designer</i>, can load one or more of these into your book.<br/><br/>As for "tossing out the first axiom," if the group does come up with its own setting this way, I strongly suspect it's best to start with some kind of relatively freeform brainstorming, followed by boiling ideas down into formal axioms once you have enough ideas with enough group buzz around them. I think it'd be very tricky to come up with axioms from a cold start, then vote them up or down, and expect anything coherent to result (although <i>Universalis</i> "tenets" work exactly this way; I've never played so I don't know how well or poorly that works, thu Uni actual play is infamous for weird lasersharked jumbles of elements from different genres).<br/><br/>Note that "brainstorm, boil down, and formalize" blurs the ownership of each idea, in what I think is a creatively useful way: maybe I came up with the first thought in the brainstorm, Tony leapt on it and made it cooler, Ron boiled it down to a few sentences, and Mike came up with the actual wording of the axiom we voted to include. This makes it possible for the group to cross-fertilize before each axiom is prematurely crystallized. I think it's a more creatively fertile process than, "Bob, say your idea - okay let's vote!", not just a less socially awkward one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_77471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77471/#Comment_77471" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T10:41:54+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 10:41AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2007 10:42AM by Sydney Freedberg.">edited June 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and this problem\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>the more I game, the more I see groups all taking this tack, and doing a sort of hilarious little Chip and Dale routine about setting ...

Just go with a very, very light version of the classic "you're reading the rulebook, you're going to be GMing" assumption and make a hard rule that says<br/><br/><b>Before the group meets to brainstorm and write up a new setting, it's one player's responsibility to write up three ideas -- a sentence or two each is plenty -- about three <i>different</i> possible settings. The point is to come up with something rough to kickstart discussion, maybe even just an image or an out-of-context idea, not to write up anything like a synopsis.<br/>If only one person in the group has read these rules, that person is responsible for coming up with the three starting ideas (that'd be you, presumably, since you're reading this). If more than one person knows the rules, someone should volunteer before the group meets. If you meet and no one's done anything, the job falls to whoever had showed up first (usually the person whose house it is).</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77493/#Comment_77493" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-25T12:29:54+00:00" title="June 25, 2007 12:29PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is sort of related to something I was thinking about the other day.
