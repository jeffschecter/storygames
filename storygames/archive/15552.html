A LOT of what you're talking about here happens in that game. Everything monster-like is on a card, all wounds are handled with cards, other tracking things are done with little chits and tokens. It doesn't hurt that I also think the game is genius and is everything that I could ever want in a fantasy RPG all in one delicious little package. ;-)<br/><br/>More to your point though, I don't think it quite does the same things that the Pathfinder box set is looking to do. WFRP3 doesn't feel like it's built for entry-level gaming. The only thing holding the game back from that, in my opinion at least, is the price point. The basic set, which is everything you'd need to run the game for three players and GM just shy of pencils is $100.00. If they made a set that included less "stuff" from the original boxed set and knocked the price down by half? Then we'd be talking. <br/><br/>Pathfinder is a crazy monster of an RPG though, innit? One of my friends is a bit younger than me and came into gaming on the 3.5 edition train. For him, Pathfinder is a godsend. I've only gotten the chance to play it once, but it was a bit fun. Not exactly my cuppa, but there was fun gears and widgets in that system that I could totally see new players coming to the table and loving, especially if they've a mind for things tactical. <br/><br/>It's fantastic that you guys were able to hit the table running in such a quick amount of time. Now, is that set-up time for a group that has a player at least marginally familiar with the rules, or were you able to get the wheels spinning that quickly with a group of all newcomers? Either way that's a pretty damned nice setup time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352632/#Comment_352632" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T12:01:52+00:00" title="December 28, 2011 12:01PM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Tyler:</b> 100% agreement, for what it's worth.

Spoiler alert.<br/><br/>The big climax is a fight against a dragon the party cannot possibly beat (seriously, run the numbers). It can easily kill any party member in one round, so there's advice on how to avoid wiping out the party. Plus the dragon simply flees when wounded. Yes, just runs away, never to return. It's a BS fight.<br/><br/>Worse still, to even have a chance to drive it off you need to conveniently stumble upon the unforeshadowed dragon slaying sword. The adventure recommends that if the players do start to go to the dragon room (which they don't know about) before they bump into the sword (which they don't know about) you should subtly hint that maybe they should should explore other parts of the dungeon first. And then what? One character gets to be the rockstar while the other three stand around providing flanks or doing piddly damage. The characters own abilities are meaningless: it's just the guy with the magic sword that matters. It's like they tried to intentionally recreate the most deprotagonizing and silently bitter moments of old school D&amp;D.<br/><br/>Some of that could be salvaged. If the characters were told "there's a terrifying dragon, you can't defeat it, but it's a cowardly old worm, an evil bully, and if you are brave and show no fear you just might be able to scare it off" that would be a big improvement. And you can foreshadow the sword and make it something the heroes are looking for to drive off the dragon, not a strangely convenient find, but that doesn't change the socially destructive "Buffy and the Slayerettes" problem. Other characters get items meant for them (wand of cure lights wounds, wand of magic missiles) but they are not in the same league. But you could fix that too by replacing the sword with a talisman that weakens the dragon (smaug kryptonite) so all the party members have an easier time hurting it. That could turn it into a real fight.<br/><br/>As written, it's pretty much the exact opposite of what I'd want to demo in a D&amp;D game, that being teamwork and your decisions mattering. Yes, a very experienced DM could detect these problems and work around them, compensating for the design flaws (I think I just did), but that's not the target audience of an intro adventure, is it?<br/><br/>(yes, I played the adventure. As soon as I found the dragon slaying sword I feared the worst)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_352892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352892/#Comment_352892" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-01T01:52:09+00:00" title="January  1, 2012  1:52AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That is a beautiful and terrible description, Ben.

The adventure concludes with the character getting a magic item and some treasure, but without an actual character sheet, the player can't choose to continue playing that character.</blockquote>\nAlso of note:\n<blockquote>Second, the skill rules make no reference to the idea of Taking 10 or Taking 20. This may create some repetitive dice rolling and/or frustration in situations where these options would make sense for the characters.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Third, and most significant, there's one major thing that's been left out of these rules that could cause problems for players moving from the Beginner Box rules to the full rules -- namely, opportunity attacks. Now, attacks of opportunity are a bit complicated, so I can understand the desire to leave them out of the beginner rules. However, it could have been done in a better way than it's been done here.<br/><br/>WotC's 3.X boxed sets left out opportunity attacks from the rules, but they did so by changing the rules so that characters weren't allowed to do anything that would provoke an attack of opportunity. The Pathfinder Beginner Box does this partway -- characters aren't allowed to make ranged attacks or cast non-melee spells while adjacent to enemies. The movement rules, however, allow characters to move freely past enemies in combat. WotC's boxed sets required any move to end when you moved adjacent to an enemy, and as long as you were adjacent to an enemy, you could only move five feet at a time.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_352936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352936/#Comment_352936" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-02T02:02:16+00:00" title="January  2, 2012  2:02AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure what the character comment is about.
