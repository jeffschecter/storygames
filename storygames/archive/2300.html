                    I'm fascinated by one of Mike's comments in another thread, to which I can't be arsed to link:
<blockquote>Don't play games at Cons with people you haven't gotten to know. It's a "convention." Where you go to convene with people. And then play games with them. It's not a "anonymention." This isn't a chess tournament. It's RPGs.<br/><br/>If you've signed up for a game without really knowing anything about it (and that includes a fifty word convention schedule blurb), and it turns out to be something you didn't expect, then you are the problem. Suffer through it, and then play a game with somebody you know.</blockquote>
I'm fascinated, because it's so different from my experience. At Cons, I almost always game with strangers: not people I've talked to, just whoever turns up at the table. <br/><br/>I find it shakes me out of my comfort zone: I get to play styles of games I wouldn't usually get to play. Also, there's a weird energy about gaming with strangers: when I run LARPs, it's almost always the strangers, the ones whom nobody knows and who sign up at the last minute, who play the best characters.<br/><br/>What about you? At conventions, do you generally game with people you know? Do you sign up for games with strangers? Do you talk to people, then decide to game with them? And which, on the whole, do you find the most rewarding? I'm genuinely interested, so indulge me.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>

                            I game with people I don't know. However, I usually have better games with people I do know -- even if the knowing is only from the net. But I still love the other games because they often teach me new things, even if only in the negative. <br/><br/>Also, playing with people you know, but haven't played with before, doesn't always a great game make. I've fucked it more than once when playing with folks I've known (online, for instance) but never played with before.                        </div>

                            At StoryGames Boston and running/being in demos at GenCon, I've gotten over the fear of playing with total strangers.  It is often awesome.<br/><br/>However, this past week at Dreamation (edit: not Dreamation, Vericon), we tried to rope a bunch of people into playing PTA with us, but it ended up just being those of us from SG Boston, who play with each other every week.  Not sure what that was about.  The game was fun, but we didn't get to share it with anyone.                        </div>

                            I'm with you. The main reason, for me, to go to a con is to play games I don't get to play at home with people I don't play with at home. I go to play in demos, try out that weird game that nobody I know would ever run, and generally do new things.<br/><br/>I largely stopped attending the main local con here in the Twin Cities because there was so little turnover in events, GMs, and attendees. It seemed more and more to be an opportunity for people to play Part XVII of their ongoing series of con games with the same slightly rotating cast of people.                        </div>

                            I consider myself introverted in ordinary life.  I generally prefer to have <i>someone</i> that I'm familiar with at the table, but I enjoy it if most of the people are new.  Playing with people I know is somewhat safer in the sense of avoiding games that suck.  <br/><br/>On the other hand, I had a lot of great times at Knutpunkt and AmberCon NorthWest with a bunch of complete strangers -- so maybe I'm partially being cured of my introversion.  And I've made a lot of good friends meeting people at conventions, so I think it's a good thing.                        </div>

                            Generally there is at least one other person I know at the table when I play games at cons.  Sometimes it's the gm, sometimes it's another player.   I like to have that small bit of familiarity since I'm fairly shy.                        </div>

                            I have to agree with John.  I like having someone I know at the table, but I love meeting new people at con games.  That's part of the reason I go to them.  I certainly don't need to play with the same people every week.<br/><br/>And I agree with Graham about the energy that comes from gaming (and especially running) with people you don't know.  You want them to have a good time so you get jazzed for it.<br/><br/>I have met and gamed with a <b>lot</b> of different people the past year through <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/troupe_berkeley" rel="nofollow">Troupe Berkeley</a>, a SF East Bay Area Google Group that Elliot Wilen started up.  That has become my extended gaming group, and we get some nice recruits at the EndGame minicons in Oakland.                        </div>

<p>My entire motivation for attending cons is to play with people I <em>know</em> are cool, but are usually sort of geographically inaccessible. And/or hang out with them.</p>
<p>That doesn't exclude playing with new people, and sometimes new people are super cool, but they are sprinkles. Not really why I go to the ice cream shop.</p>

                            Whomever's at the table is welcome, and I don't always make a huge effort to get to know them. I'm glad when people stick around to talk, though. I typically get some people I know and some I've never met, and since signup is not in my game room, I basically have to expect to see a bunch of people I don't know. When I sign up for games, I'll definitely look for people I know and like running them, but it's certainly not necessary.                        </div>

                            I will totally seek out GMs, but that's a slightly different vector - it's not a social thing, it's because they're GMs I wants something specific from.

                            I was actually going to start a new thread about this, but my comments seem connected to the ongoing discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I just attended Dreamation, and it was my first gaming-centered con.  I'd been to other cons that had gaming in them (Philcon, for example), but this was the first where gaming was the primary concern.  It was also the first one I attended for more than one day.<br/>

It was an interesting experience.  Everyone I met, and thus played with, was a stranger.  The only exception was eruditus, whom I knew from gaming with him in Philly, and a couple of my friends who I saw briefly on Saturday night.<br/>
<br/>
Playing with strangers was absolutely no problem.  The games I played in ranged from amusing to absolutely kick-ass.  There wasn't a single session that I found myself bored with or uncomfortable in.<br/>
<br/>
It was *in between games* that seemed to be the issue.<br/>
<br/>
As quoted in the first post, people seemed to primarily be there to hang out with people they knew.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, obviously.  But it did occur to me on several occasions how said people ever got to *know* each other in the first place...<br/>
<br/>
What I observed was this: during games people were exceedingly friendly and open.  But I would see those same people not an hour later in the hallway and give them a quick wave or a smile and get absolutely nothing in return.  I wasn't expecting them to stop where they stood and start talking to me, but something more than a blank stare would have been appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn't quite sure what to make of it.  As I said, I had absolutely no issues while in-game, but between sessions, the whole affair became very cliquish.  There was very much a feeling of 'us' and 'them'.  And I felt very much a part of the latter group.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn't completely universal.  I had some very cool conversations with Ben and Matt and Dave and a couple of others after and between sessions, but I would say that the majority of people I met definitely fell into the pattern I've described.<br/>
<br/>
My question is this: why did a community that prides itself on inclusion, that's always interested in growing and adding new members, come off as so insular and cliquish?  If I hadn't been such a long time lurker, if I hadn't known indie games from my experiences outside of Dreamation, I think I might have walked away with the feeling that I had no place in the indie gaming community.  If I'd just been a guy who'd attented the con to play some D20 or board games and wandered down into the Indie Explosion room, I think I might have walked away feeling as if there were no place for me there.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying that someone whom you play a game with should be an instant friend of yours.  I'm also not saying you need to hang out with people you have no interest in hanging with.  I just thought it was important to give an outsider's observations of what "I only go to cons to be with people I know" might look like.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<p>This past year I GMed at Origins and GenCon.  If I remember correctly, every single player I had during those sessions were people who I was either meeting right there at the beginning of the game or had met in a previous session.</p>
<p>Every one of those sessions was above-board awesome.  Doubly so because I got to meet new people and I get to witness their awesome RPG skillz.</p>
<p>I can't even imagine myself going to a convention and not playing at least one game with strangers.</p>

                            So, Pecc, I just finished observing the same thing, and I honestly think that 90% of it is that people are so excited to see each other, and so limited by the geography of the conversational space, that it creates these enthusiastic knots which appear a lot more impermeable than they are.  At least I hope that's the case.<br/><br/>Anyway, if I was part of any conversation that gave that impression, let me lay down an apology right now.  It's something I actively hope to avoid, but I have occasional geek blinders too.  <br/><br/>-Rob D.<br/><br/>PS - The fact that I will be damned if I can keep the Dans and Matts straight  probably doesn't help either. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

<p>This is a super-cool idea. I'm glad that I met and got to talk to people that I've never before encountered in person; it's palpably different, though, to make someone's acquaintance completely cold, and somewhat frightening to meet someone who knows <em>your</em> online face but you don't know theirs for whatever reason. The constant cultural spectre of stalking looms, even when that's pretty clearly not the case.</p>
<p>Having a con attendees introduction thread <strong>that lurkers and newcomers chose to participate in</strong> would vastly improve that experience for everyone involved, I think.</p>

                            I don't generally play (aka. GM) with strangers in convention, even though the few experiences I've had with playing strangers have been very positive. This is partly because of the comfort zone (there are more asshats in conventions than amongst your regular friends, or so one hopes) and partly because the way I run games needs players who can subscribe to certain style of playing (Freeform). The few times I have run games from strangers have worked because the games were properly advertised as what they were, and thus got players already subscribed to the mindset. The last time I played in convention I ended up playing ye-olde painfull dungeon crawl done badly, advertised as something else.<br/><br/>I don't really (anymore) see the point of running games to people I can play with outside convention, so I'm usually not playing games in conventions any more. It's more of a social occasion, with good programme.                        </div>

                            Hey Dan, and Rob,<br/><br/>I've definitely experienced that awkward interface between the people who know each other well and are desperate for some quality in-person time, and those who are new to the scene and just want to make new friends and share the excitement.  I often feel like I'm in both camps at once.  My personal solution was to make sure that everybody I was talking to was introduced to everybody else as a baseline.  I also tried to deliberately include people in conversations and help facilitate introductions whenever I could.  None of this hurt my fun and I met some great people.                        </div>

                            yeah, Dan, I wish I had keyed on that and included you.  No doubt my buddy Matt found the same situation (yes, I even brought my own Matt).  I think what was said was right on the money about wanted to connect with folks we seem to know a great deal about only online.  There is also a sense for some folk of "I have this game I am trying to churn out and I want the persepctives of people I trust on the matter."  So I heard a lot of shop talk which I think folks are less likely to turn to a stranger to have.  Many of the folk I was associating with were either from here or my NerdNYC buddies and I had my wife and friend with me so Dreamation for me is an instant party <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Even so, as I mentioned in another thread, I am way extroverted and I still didn't say hi to certain folk due to "I don't want to bother them" or "I'm on the way to an event."                        </div>

                            I knew when I posted that, I should have clarified.<br/>
<br/>
I play with people I've never met previously. Lots.<br/>
<br/>
What I also do, however, is get to know the people that I'm playing with. It's really not hard. Instead of saying, "Hi, this game is HQ, here are the pregens - which do you want to play?" I say something like, "Hi, my name is Mike Holmes. I'm a member of the MOLAD demo team, blah, blah. I'm a programmer/analyst from Wisconsin, married, and have two kids. Nice to meet you all. What's your name?"<br/>
<br/>
I socialize.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the point. If I do this, and make the sort of instant friends that one can make at cons, I enable these players to be able to bow out of my game like this, "You know Mike, this just isn't my thing. Would it be cool if I left to try something else?"<br/>
<br/>
And then it's not some stranger dissing my game, but somebody I know telling me the honest truth.<br/>
<br/>
All I'm saying is to be social. It's that lack of socializing, treating RPG play at cons as if it were two chess opponent's meeting over a table, that makes any social interaction difficult at conventions. If you actually try to get to know the people with whom you're playing, spend ten minutes of your time on basic socializing, I garuntee you that your games will have a much higher rate of success.<br/>

                            It always depends on what is going down, etc.  I prefer to game with at least one person that I know at conventions when the game itself is "suspect" (that is, I can't say that "I've played this game before" or "I've had nothing but successes when playing this game no matter who runs it or who plays").  If the game is something like Dogs in the Vineyard, RISUS, Shab al-Hiri Roach, or even Exalted (I dunno, I've never had a bad con session of Exalted) then I'm fine with gaming with total strangers. But if I'm doing D&amp;D or even any small-press game that I've not had experience with, I much prefer to have at least one friend/aquaintence there.<br><br>But otherwise: Yeah, I go to Cons to:<br><br>1) Meet online/far-away buddies<br>2) Try playing new games that I haven't played before (RPGs and Board Games)<br><br>In.

                            I go to conventions to hang out with people I know from online or previous conventions, but when signing up for games I typically don't pay any attention to who else is signed up for it or who's running. I go to small conventions, so anyone I game with is quickly going to become "someone I know." I found it's a really good way to meet new people at a con - after I've gamed with someone walking up to them and asking how their con has been going is cake.                        </div>

                            The way I see it is that I have only so many hours to hang out with people I know well, get to know certain people better whom I know sorta-kinda from the net, and get my game on. I truly want to meet new people and make new friendships, too, but those are lower on my priority list than hanging with the people I already adore. <br><br>Also, blank stares are often due to having been up till 4 AM the night before or due to being overwhelmed by the sea of faces.

                            Mike, <br><br>Oh fuck yea -- I do the same. I game with strangers, but only in the sense that I'd never met them before we got to the con. Before we actually roll the first dice I usually know their names, where they're from, what they do, and what they're hoping for from the game, as a minimum. Games where everyone wants to instantly rush to play with no introductions I will usually duck out of.                        </br></br></div>

                            I'll play with people I don't know, but I try to do reconnaissance beforehand.  I've been in lots of stinky con games and I don't ever want to have to face the awkwardness of The Ditch again. <br><br/>So I'll note who's running the games that have piqued my interest and I'll scout the gamemasters well before the game and try to get a feel for what they're all about.  If I get a bad feeling or even a meh feeling, I stay away and cancel my signup for that game. It's better to burn some con time idling in the dealer room or looking for a pickup game of something than to be trapped in an unpleasant thing.                        </br></div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>I am sorry that you didn't feel included.</blockquote>
I'm not certain if that's accurate.  As I said, I think I would've felt that way if I had no context for the community.  If I'd been someone who just wandered down from the board game room upstairs and had the same experience, yes, I think I'd have felt excluded.<br/><br/>As things were, I think I was just generally confused.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>My first instinct was that your good time is your own responsibility.</blockquote>
I totally agree with this.  And the thing is: I enjoyed myself.  I had a good time.  That's part of what confused me so much.  Like Mike Holmes clarified above, I didn't just game - I socialized a bit.  I introduced myself, spoke a little about myself.  <br/><br/>It just seemed that socialization had an almost physical limit.  It ended at the table, when the game ended.  <br/><br/>In any case, my enjoyment wasn't (and isn't) dependant on anyone else's acceptance.  I got over that BS in high school, thanks. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judd</cite>But Rob pointed out that we don't have a responsibility but an opportunity to welcome someone with a new perspective and make them feel welcome.</blockquote>
I think that most accurately describes my disappointment: a missed opportunity.  I went to the con, played some great games with some cool people and generally had an awesome time of it.  It's just that there were some opportunities there to continue talking with some of those people that were missed.  And I didn't think it was from lack of trying or socializing on my part.<br/><br/>I want to make it clear that I'm not blaming anyone or saying that it was anyone's responsibility to make me feel more welcomed than I did.  I was just noting how the tension that Jason points out in his post above (between those who know each other well and those who are new) is a very real thing.<br/><br/>Finally, I note that the most prevalent theme amongst those who are in the 'game with people you know' camp is the avoidance of bad games.  Did I just really luck out in that everything I played I enjoyed?  I'll admit to either knowing about game systems beforehand (in most cases), or just being curious about a game after reading the description (in the case of Bliss Stage).  Was it just a combination of luck and preparation?  <br/><br/>-- d                        </div>

                            There aren't so many gamers in Tucson that I can go to a con and play with strangers. Playing with fellers from across town you haven't seen in a while and swapping stories about the last time you played is part of the fun.                        </div>

<blockquote>Don't play games at Cons with people you haven't gotten to know.</blockquote>
While that might at first <i>sound</i> weird and counter to many people's reason to play at cons, I guess I had (in the original context Mike stated this) read something further into this: <br/><br/>Get to know the people you're playing with.<br/><br/>In other words, (mine, not Mike's!) it's not an endorsement of cliquishness and insularity, it's a wise observation that if your whole level of interest in the other participants does not surpass that of objects from which to get your "gaming fix," well uh, yeah, of course you're going to be prone to distasteful social situations. The rules of social meet 'n' greet don't fly out the window just because you've all agreed on a set of rules or setting.<br/><br/>If you're willing to get to know those strangers, awesome, play on. If you're not willing to know them, well, crap... don't play with 'em.                        </div>

                            Hey Dan/peccable:<br/><br/>If I failed to acknowledge a friendly nod, I apologize.  I really enjoyed playing with you and would have loved to have gotten to know you outside of the table.  <i>I</i> actually experience it as a disappointing loss that I didn't get to know you more, just as you do, everyone else.  I will definitely try to be cognizant of people who are hanging in the area in the future and try to bring them in.<br/><br/>==<br/><br/>Generally, there are people I have gamed with before that I wish I could game with more often (Judd, for example), but I don't rely upon getting into games with people I know.  I pick the game I want to play first, then whoever's there, that's gravy.  There is a certain delight to getting to play with some people I only ever see at Cons (like Awesome Steve with the Tattoos) but I find that picking the right games tends to preselect the right kind of right-thinking people.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Larry</cite>Get to know the people you're playing with.</blockquote>
Amen.<br/><br/>Last GenCon, I managed to play an entire event sitting right next to a guy I've gamed with at ENWorld Gamedays, yet he didn't mention this or say hello until we were all leaving. Granted, I also did not recognize him right off the bat, so I'm at fault, too. Still, since there were no introductions or anything, there was no opportunity for a "Dude, it's you!" moment.<br/><br/>The "chess tournament" anonymity of most con events honestly creeps me out. I sit there thinking, "Seriously? Are we such nerds that we're going to ignore each other until the GM gets here, and then only speak in order to facilitate the game?" At some point, I'll just start introducing myself.<br/><br/>Ergo, when I run events, I try to make a point to do introductions. At the very least, it prevents everyone from having to refer to each other as "the dwarf" and whatnot. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            When I'm GMing I also make an effor tto introduce people to one another.  I think I might go one further and ask for a little gaming resume.

                            Yeah, it would be odd as a Hero Quest demo team guy, if I claimed that people should only play with those people they were well aquainted with before the game. I run for folks who are complete strangers when the walk up to the table. When writing the damn quote above, I knew that this might happen, and my concession was writing "haven't gotten to know." As opposed to "Only play with people you already know."<br/>
<br/>
That'll teach me for rushing to make a point.<br/>
<br/>
But I think we all pretty much agree here. Don't be insular, don't be cliquish. That's not saying don't play with people you know, it's saying don't play only with people you already know. Use games as an opportunity to meet new people... but then meet the new people. Shake hands, introduce yourself. Tell people who you are and what you do. Try to get same from them. Chat.<br/>
<br/>
You know... be social. Simple as that. Makes the whole process twice as enjoyable, and half as difficult. Four times the fun.<br/>
