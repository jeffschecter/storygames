"What the heck is going on there?" I think to myself. Well, here's what I see in my mail slot.  <br/> <br/>A package that includes a new copy of the <i>Burning Empires</i> hardback book, a bookmark, and a letter:  \n<blockquote>Hello Burning Empires fan,  <br/> <br/>As you may or may not know, portions of the first printing of Burning Empires have problems with their bindings. The books don't fall apart, but the pages pull away, and the damned thing just looks ugly after a while.  <br/> <br/>Since you were very supportive of the Burning Empires project and preordered the book, Chris Moeller and I have decided to repay your kindness with a free second copy. This copy should be free from any annoying problems and we hope you'll use it to stave off the Vaylen threat from your world.  <br/> <br/>Thanks so much for your support.  <br/>-Luke Crane</blockquote>\nDayyum.  <br/> <br/>Luke; thank-you very much for your thoughtful gift (really, I can't think of it any other way). Just in time for Christmas.  <br/> <br/>I promise that one of my groups will play this game <i>at some point</i> (right now really isn't an option, but darn it, this game <i>will be played</i>!).<br/><br/>To me, this is one indication of why the indie games community has met with the success that it has: because the people who are making these games seem to genuinely <i>care</i> about the people who play their games.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108893">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108893/#Comment_108893" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-19T13:52:55+00:00" title="November 19, 2007  1:52PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I had read a similar story last week.

Normally, when there's a printing error (such as binding), the printer re-runs the book. Obviously, if this happens before the book is released, it simply delays the release. But, if it's something that is discovered only through use (as this apparently did), they'd have contacted the printer after the fact. Now, here's where I'm really curious. Luke, did you eat the shipping costs to get these reprints shipped out to the pre-order customers or did the printer eat that too? If the latter, that's some serious customer service on their part too, and I'm thinking I'd want to know who you used for my own purposes. (If the former, then, yes, that's pretty amazing customer service on your part.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
