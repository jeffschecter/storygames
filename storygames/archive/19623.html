The idea is system-independent.<br/><br/>Every time a player fails a roll, the GM can offer to make it a success at a price; When this happens, add a single point to the Escalation score. The Escalation score determines the intensity of the game, and creates an increasing level of tension as the story progresses. <br/><br/>The ES determines what the GM can do in terms of obstacles and enemies as an extra level of intensity. The GM isn't limited, but can use the ES explicitly to ramp up the drama and tension for the players.<br/><br/>It also has a mechanical effect; the higher the ES, the more difficult the players\u2019 challenges will be (when the GM decides that it's appropriate). An exception is combat; when a roll fails in combat, it does not generate ES points.<br/><br/>The players can deescalate the game in several ways. They can complete character goals and they can role-play to reduce tension in the fiction. The ES mechanic serves as a reward/stick rule, since it is always in the PCs best interest to lower the ES. Note that the GM controls when the ES is changed.<br/><br/>All choices need to fit the fiction; the GM must come up with a reason for the increased difficulty. Also remember that the GM\u2019s role is not to be adversarial; the ES is simply a way to raise the level of suspense as the game progresses. <br/><br/>ES shouldn't be used on random traps or simply make the game harder; what I am going for is something more complicated. The ES should be used when the game fiction becomes more intense/interesting by further complicating it.<br/><br/>ES never limits the GM's ability to do anything. He has all the power a normal GM has, all the time. The point of an ES is to help the GM manage the intensity.<br/><br/>So I am looking for feedback on this idea. What kind of things can the GM do with a high ES? It never limits the GM, but it opens new options. The obvious idea is an increase in combat difficulty, but having the ES do more is a no-brainer.<br/><br/>Also, think about how the ES is increased - I began with the idea that every time a player failed an important roll, the ES went up; but that would cause the players to limit themselves.<br/><br/>Any feedback would be appreciated!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435874/#Comment_435874" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T10:11:42+00:00" title="July 28, 2014 10:11AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think this idea is from AW, but you can have Fronts (groups of any size, of different natures, with a goal and an agenda that might make them antagonize the pc's, use them or help them) and put "clocks" on their agendas. On AW there isn't exactly a escalation mechanic like yours, but as the story goes, the clocks of these Fronts keep ticking and once they reach certain point, something happens with that front. They either get enough resources to advance their agenda, change their plans, focus on something else, etc.<br/><br/>Fronts in this sense can also be applied to events that will happen in a certain time. Let's say, a hurricane. Each time the clock advances, PCs will be able to see the signs of the hurricane coming. They may not be able to stop it, but they can put all their effort into seeking a refuge or fleeing the place while they can.<br/><br/>I think in AW (Was it AW?, I'm not realy sure where I readed this anymore) this whole escalation felt more organic, since players couldn't see it at all, but it was clear for the GM and she could introduce the proper elements to make it clear for the players trough the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435875">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435875/#Comment_435875" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T10:12:40+00:00" title="July 28, 2014 10:12AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you might find Dogs in the Vineyard an interesting read.

It can also be used to move a countdown forward. <br/><br/>AW doesn't have an escalation mechanic like this one, though. And I agree that transparency for the players is important when using the ES; they should be aware of the score, so they can work on getting it down when it becomes too high.<br/><br/>The main idea is to create an intensity curve that grows with the session time and culminates at the climax of the story. Having a mechanic that automatically creates a climax at the end of the session would be very helpful for a lot of people.<br/><br/>Or perhaps it would be more interesting to have several curves throughout a session?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435882/#Comment_435882" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T11:41:57+00:00" title="July 28, 2014 11:41AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/wingsofwax">@wingsofwax</a> - it is not exactly an escalation score for all Players, but I designed something similar for an hack of AW that I am working on at the moment.

Ie. can he still do stuff if he doesn't have any? You might find that you're incapacitating the GM in that case. I had the same thought, but dropped it because of the limitation on the GM.<br/><br/>While the ES concept does provide the players with the ability to "fail forwards", its main thing is giving the GM the option of managing intensity. I want the GM to have very specific options on how to use the ES to make the game flow better. I am working on it, but would like to get some new perspectives.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435933">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435933/#Comment_435933" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-28T19:36:13+00:00" title="July 28, 2014  7:36PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We added a form of this to our D&amp;D home game...Attrition.

Also, many people consider realism the fun part of rpgs. 8-)<br/><br/>I do like your idea however.

Note though, that Taint is a character's score. The GM does not have Taint, but a character with a lot of Taint is more vulnerable to GM's Moves (he will be the target of more Moves)<br/><br/>- the GM can of course make his moves regularly (i.e. on a 6-) but can use the Taint on a character to put him as the target of a move<br/><br/>- basically, stuff always happens, including bad stuff (as for other AW-hacks). With Taint, <b>it is worse</b><br/><br/>Your ES concept is not the same, because it manages as you wrote 'intensity'... it's something that looks more similar to the Mythic - Chaos Factor.<br/><br/>Anyway, feel free to look at the City of Judas for inspiration.<br/><br/>Another thing you might want to consider, is to increase certain scores depending on the ES (the harm suffered by the characters? the mana to spend for a spell? the level of the enemies that the characters will face?).<br/><br/>Of course, this really depends on the rest of your mechanics, so I do not have specific advise here...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
