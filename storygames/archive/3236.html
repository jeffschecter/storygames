I have a copy of the rules and am looking to build some mechs, but I don't have a good feel for how long a 2 or 3 player standard game would take. I saw another thread suggesting that adding an extra attachment to each mech would extend the game length by about 25% but without any actual estimate of the usual game length.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nMyles                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
