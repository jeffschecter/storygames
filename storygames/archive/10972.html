I can see how it's useful (or <i>vital</i> in some games), but it severely gets in the way of my imagination.  And once my imagination is in free-flow, uninterrupted by other stuff going on around the table, that's when my immersion is strongest.  We played 4th ed. D&amp;D the other day and I was deeply immersed until the first encounter, at which point out comes the battle-mat and the figures.  And that was that. <br/><br/>Another thing: one member of my gaming group is always offering cakes around.  They're on a plate.  Everyone can take one whenever they like.  Instead, the GM gets the plate shoved under their nose right in the middle of some important exposition.  Cakes are good, for sure, but not at the expense of loss of immersion!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243481/#Comment_243481" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T12:34:13+00:00" title="November 24, 2009 12:34PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>Haven't we already done this some months back?</blockquote>\nPossibly.

If that makes me schitzo, then we thank you for the compliment (it's sad to see other humans trapped with one personality--what if it's an asshole?!?).<br/><br/>I have felt most immersed in LARPs:<br/><br/>* Once, portraying a wolf (NPC) in a boffer LARP, I ended up alone because my pack was all (stupid and got) killed. Wandering the fringes of the camp sites, trying to stalk individuals that I thought I could take down, fleeing bands of hunters who noticed me and decided they couldn't brook some mangy wolf sniffing around the edge of the village... Yeah, that was VERY fun, very immersive.<br/><br/>* At a Dragon*Con theater LARP, I was extremely moved by a scene that a woman and I played out... pretty much without anyone else looking on. It was a logical result of play up until that point, given even more frisson by the fact that the game was ending badly for the PCs (Call of Cthulhu; failed to figure out the bad guy; and so Hound of Tindalos emerging to kill us all). We were both near tears, with fear and some actor's equivalent of "love," and it didn't really even matter if no one else was watching--we were watching each other in the moment (and the organizer's passable special effects), riffing off each other, and it worked VERY well.<br/><br/>* Pretty much any time after nightfall on moonless nights, going ANYWHERE is rife with tension and, yep, even fear. One doesn't go wandering alone, at the very least. And basically having to sneak back to my cabin to get anything (or retire for the night) added a special angle to the immersion: I have to be as thoroughly prepared as one would imagine a night adventurer would have to be, in such a world, before I stepped out onto the village path. Might not be able to make it BACK there, later, if the shit hits the fan!<br/><br/>I have managed similar immersion in tabletop, at times, but oddly enough only with horror-themed games. I recall being quite spooked out during an all-night Chill game, but I was rather young then (maybe 13 or 14--25 years ago).<br/><br/>Then again, I'm a Stanislavsky Method actor, so "immersion" has only ever had one meaning for me. And the crux seems to be achieving some echo of the emotions that are plausible and appropriate for the situation, not merely PORTRAYING them. Most tabletop play doesn't let me stay in character enough to achieve full immersion, between having to manage system, deal with real world interruptions (mine and others), and think strategically, be it in terms of story arc (with these hippie games) or in terms of game resources (with more "trad" games).<br/><br/>You want to BREAK my immersion?<br/><br/>* Crack OOC jokes about last week's Lost or similar. Although, actually, I have all-but-mastered ignoring this stuff and ostracizing the perpetrators, so it only "shakes" my immersion, it doesn't break it.<br/><br/>* "Been There, Done That, Got  The Chainmail" - There's a class of LARPers who feel that they have to somehow retain their "coolness" by acting like anything and everything in-game is something they've seen before, could beat with one hand behind their backs, and is best addressed with snarky comments and wisecracks. I've actually said to one particularly jaded brat, "Hey, man, sounds like you should just quit the game, if it's so boring and old hat. We'd all be glad not to listen to your bullshit anymore." He had at least the decency to blush and go off with his other (almost as jaded, and practicing HARD to match up!) OOC and IC buddies... to plot some kind of OOC, PVP gank. Which reminds me:<br/><br/>* Playing a political game with a combat monster; showing up for a combat fest with a non-com. I like to play out of type, too, at times. But it gets REALLY silly to see yet-another "tough, secretive assassin" hanging on the fringes of what is ostensibly a court of powerful and connected people. The "loner type" whose put all build points into combat and, as such, can't accomplish shit in the ACTUAL game play. And so what does he do? Trump up the thinnest excuses to gank someone, because "his guy would do that." To which I'd reply, "which is why your thug wouldn't be admitted within a half a mile of these gentles!" and look for an in-game authority to lock him up. (I find the irony of putting "the loner" into a isolated cell all event just too rich!) The non-com who shows up asking everyone to just get along just gets dropped, no muss no fuss (no lost Armor Points). But he's still immersion-breaking, if only because he can show how a somewhat thin premise for conflict isn't worth bloodshed. (So what? This is a fest--we came to let blood, ya Gandhi wannabee!)<br/><br/>* Get into a long debate about some annoying niggle of the system. I tend to walk away from these, now, when not forced into a Hold. If I'm in a Hold, I give him or her a TINY bit of time to deal... then bitch and mock the number-cruncher who's wasting 20 or 40 people's time to sort out 1 or 2 points of damage!<br/><br/>* Technology. In tabletop, you want me to drop totally out and restart cold... let your fucking 50-Cent ring tone go off. In LARP, drive your fucking SUV through the middle of the medieval village during game-on, because you're late AND too much of an asshole to carry your own shit to your cabin. (I've flattened folks' tires for doing this--you've been warned!) I even dislike when organizers have to use walkie-talkies to confirm stuff with each other--if I'm asking OOC, then fine; if I'm asking an NPC and the GM isn't sure... well, then, the NPC isn't sure at the moment: "Ask again later" is preferable t:<br/>"Hang on, Dave--*SSSHHH-TKK* Hey, Chip; who's the person whose got the treaty?" [wait] "*SHHH-TKT* "It's the Lord of Fortenfart's page, Blarfed." *SHHH-TKT* OK, thanks." *SHHH-TKT* "What?" *SSHK-TKKT* I SAID THANKS!" *SH-TK *Ah, OK."<br/>... what did I ask about, again? God... do I care anymore, really?<br/><br/>Sorry so long--slow day at work, and the memories started flowing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_243536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito" title="Davide Losito"><img alt="Davide Losito" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.webinprogress.it/allyraid/badtoro2out.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Davide%20Losito">Davide Losito</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/243536/#Comment_243536" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-24T17:04:48+00:00" title="November 24, 2009  5:04PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>For me, "immersion" always and only means "being in character" or, similarly, "forgetting that it's all fantasy."
