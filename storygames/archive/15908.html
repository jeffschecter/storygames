I tell myself I'd just check it out of the library anyhow ... am I a bad guy?) - anyhow, there's a crapload of improv games in there and he often says something like, "This game is good for teaching such-and-such." Often he does it backwards, like he'll illustrate blocking by having them play a game that's all blocking, like fortunately/unfortunately.<br/><br/>Also, I played a game of <i>Penny For My Thoughts</i> yesterday where one of the players, new to that kind of game, was blocking - <br/>I would have thought it was nearly impossible to block in Penny but it can be done, for example:<br/>"Did the priest make advances towards you?"<br/>"Yes and I told on him and he was sent away."<br/>(Just an example, didn't happen in our game.)<br/><br/>And later I thought, she'd be <i>great</i> at Polaris. That's just the sort of protagonist you want for Polaris, fighting what the antagonist puts on them every step of the way. So you could use Polaris like Johnstone uses fortunately/unfortunately, to illustrate what blocking is.<br/><br/>So. This'll be a kitchen sink topic, I don't know what we'll get out of it, but -<br/>Can you recognize what sort of 'story gaming' skills a player has or doesn't have, and then recommend a game that fits their skill set? Or recommend a game that'll teach a key skill?<br/>Maybe the simplest thing would be to list a handful of games and say what skills they require and/or what skills they teach.<br/><br/>Like Polaris might teach 'constructive blocking' <br/>And Archipelago II might require 'patience' and teach 'how to use more descriptive detail.'<br/><br/>And - I can recognize blocking when I'm playing a whole game with someone - but is there a way to recognize a tendency to block before you even start playing, so you can pull out Polaris instead of Fiasco? Some kind of quick test - make an offer, see if they block?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_361546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361546/#Comment_361546" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T00:05:54+00:00" title="February 23, 2012 12:05AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wushu can teach terse players to be more verbose and detailed with their descriptions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_361593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/361593/#Comment_361593" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-23T06:08:57+00:00" title="February 23, 2012  6:08AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I greatly appreciated The Mountain Witch, because it taught me to focus on something other than character advancement (the exact opposite happens in that game).  And it taught me about flagging (everything I brought up with my Dark Fate got used against me, so I had to bring up things that I <i>wanted</i> to be opposed by)<br/><br/>And it does great strides at collaborative improvisation.  Sure I might <i>think</i> the facts are a certain way, but other Dark Fates can alter the facts, and they can be twisted up. <br/><br/>And there's really no positioning in The Mountain Witch at all, or at least it's so vastly different that it makes you re-evaluate it.  Tactics or weapon modifiers or situational bonuses become nothing more than narrative detail.<br/><br/>Plus most die rolls end up with Mixed Successes, so there's constantly a "yes but" angle, constantly a need to expect compromise or extra costs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>I really like Polaris, because it taught me to trust my opponent implicitly, and to not hold back with the opposition.  It's not really all or nothing play.  It's making sure the other guy actually cares.<br/><br/>I like Misspent Youth because it teaches people to be pro-active if they want to affect the fiction at all.  The Struggle goes by so quickly and so frenzied that if you don't just jump in without thinking, you probably won't get a chance to act at all.  And it puts a huge burden on the last character to act, to narrate the end and seal things off.<br/><br/>Kagematsu and Misspent Youth both teach people about tough decisions.  Misspent Youth when you either sell-out or fail (and the pressure is almost impossible to describe without actually playing a game and getting invested) and Kagematsu when you either get desperate or fail (which is almost more tense, because some of those desperation are unpalatable, and the game is more competitive than MY.)<br/><br/>I like Remember Tomorrow, because it teaches people how to weave narratives together.  I mean, you have to make your character interesting enough for people to want to see them in scenes, or there won't be any Face-Offs.  At the same time, you gotta make Deals, and that leads to threads in all directions.  It's a delicious exercise in collaboration.<br/><br/>I like Happy Birthday Robot because it EXPOSES when players all come to the table with different agendas and don't listen to one another.  Those results are jumbled and random and terrible.  There's no game mechanic to filter out the crap, or to mitigate the results.  Either you work together and follow a theme as one group, or you get terrible-bad crap and you can easily see why and how.<br/><br/>Fiasco shows whether or not people are invested.  If they don't connect with their characters and their motivations, then they just bump into one another in a slapstick chain of events that flies off the handle and spirals into unbelievability.  Either is fun, don't get me wrong, but you can tell when people "get it" and when they don't.<br/><br/>Ganakagok teaches and encourages creativity through the tarot deck.  You draw from your surroundings, and you interpret with just a few guidelines.  It requires that players can take multiple inputs and focus them into a single result, but it also gives you plenty of tools to do so.<br/><br/>Zombie Cinema teaches people to boil towards conflict, specifically inter-character conflict.  It makes it more about the relationships than the events, which is a nice twist.<br/><br/>... long enough for now.
