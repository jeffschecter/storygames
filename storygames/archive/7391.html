Nice!<br><br>The story of Muu is in many ways the story of my awakening as a games designer. So I'll go to the roots ...<br/><br/>The naivistic roleplaying game <b>Muu </b>is a product of creative synergies in the gaming milieu of Oslo in the late 80s. I got into roleplaying games through <i>Tore Stuedal </i>in 1986, as he invited me to play in his homebrew (nameless). He showed me games like this could be fun and challenging. During the years of 87-89 I played a lot, especially at the gamers club <i>Ares </i>(oldest in Norway, started in -79, still going strong). One of my gaming friends at the club was <i>Jon Venbakken</i>, a great GM and staunch supporter of James Bond the RPG. The two of us had many revealing discussions on roleplaying games, often using the reactions of the rest of the gaming milieu as a creative challenge.<br/><br/>In the winter of 1988-89 Jon and me took our discussions into practical game-design. We created a small series of games, called <b>The Impro Series</b>. We made six games in the series, alternating on who was the chief designer from game to game. We had one significant rule for all of the games: they had to be written in no more than one sheet of paper (A4). The object was to experiment, and we challenged the boundaries of game design of the time in several directions at once (both GM-tyranny, GM as a slave for the game/players and GMlessness). This series laid the foundations for all my later exploits in the field of game design. I am very sorry to say that Jon was ashamed over his gaming, and dropped out of all gaming and design around 1990. It was a great loss to me and to RPGs in general.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164545/#Comment_164545" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T00:20:52+00:00" title="August 23, 2008 12:20AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2008 1:08AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            During the winter of 88-89 Jon and me kept up parallell discussions on several fields. Among the things we discussed most, where the dominance of violence in roleplaying games. Our stance was that violence was so dominating in roleplaying games that it permeated the form. Our view was that the unsound focus on combat stunted the development of roleplaying games. During the spring of 89 this discussion made an idea grow in my mind, an idea of making a game that would be devoid of violence altogether. The dream-game of a pacifist.<br/><br/>An unsuccessful attemt at playing a character with mind-reading abilities in the campaign of Tore Stuedal, made me yearn for a game that could master telepathy between characters.<br/><br/>And then I got the wild idea that I would like to make a verbal roleplaying game on characters with no language. The idea was typical of the discourse at the time, between Jon and myself. We threw all kinds of wild ideas at eachother.<br/><br/>This was the three ideas that laid the fundament for Muu: <b>pacifism, telepathy and lack of language</b>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164552/#Comment_164552" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T01:27:44+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  1:27AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2008 1:45AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then, a night in the spring of 1989, I laid awake in my bed with ideas churning in my head. To be part of a dynamic creative discourse can place unreasonable demands on an open mind. I had no chance of sleep.<br/><br/>So I gave up sleep, and sat down by the computer (an early Mac with 30 megabyte harddisk). I sat up until 5 in the morning, writing the game of Muu. After 2 hours sleep I went to work in the kindergarten, but I continued working on the game in every little break I could get (or steal). This was tuesday may the 2nd, 1989. The same evening, after work, I went to the game-club Ares with the finished game in my rucksack.<br/><br/>I tried to get players for the first playtest. It was difficult. They asked what the game was about. Well, I told them it was all about dreaming and walking and running and bathing and searching for food, and eating it. The typical answer: <i>Doh! Sounds boring! Count me out!</i> After a time Jon and some other openminded people came in, and I got to assemble a table for the first game of Muu.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164554/#Comment_164554" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T01:37:08+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  1:37AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2008 2:03AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jon Venbakken wrote a play report for the first game of Muu. Here is an excerpt of his report:<br/><br/><i>Tuesday may the 2nd we played the new naivistic roleplaying game Muu. the designer Tomas M\xf8rkrid led the game for us. The game was about being a Muu and doing things natural to Muu. One of the genial ideas of the game is that Muu is both an individual and part of a whole: I am Muu, you are Muu, everyone is Muu. When one Muu feels something, Allmuu feels what Muu feels.<br/><br/>Doing and feeling are the central terms of this game. The players tell eachother what they feel all the time, and what they do. Usually you make traditional "doings" like sleeping, eating, hugging, etc. - and you do that by playing a card from an ordinary deck of cards (there are 13 basic actions in Muu).<br/><br/>The game was very entertaining and rewarding.<br/><br/>A typical doings-phase can be like this:<br/>- Muu (player A) wants to climb a tree to lick some maple-sirap.<br/>- Muu (player <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> is bathing.<br/>- Muu (player C) is investigating a big rock.<br/>- Player A is rolling for Muu climbing the tree, and falls down.<br/><br/>Next phase is feeling:<br/>- Player A states that Muu feels irritation.<br/>- Player B says that Muu feels bafflement (coming from a mix of the nice bath and the irritation of the other muu)<br/>- Player C states that Muu feels irritation in solidarity with Muu.<br/>The leader asks if any of them wants to change their feelings.<br/>- Player A states that the irritation of Muu is growing into fear.<br/><br/>Fear is a state that may damage Muu if not remedied. The normal remedy for fear is hugging other muus. So this development in the game may build a need for hugging in Allmuu.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164555">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/toilet%20psychic" title="toilet psychic"><img alt="toilet psychic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/toilet%20psychic">toilet psychic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164555/#Comment_164555" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T02:12:57+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  2:12AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2008 2:26AM by toilet psychic.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks a lot, Tomas.

But the design-culture of todays Norway is stronger, broader, more knowledgeable and more groundbreaking.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lowbrowgames</cite>Were there other people making innovative games/searching for new concepts in Norway at the time or you were one of the first?</blockquote>I was one of the first going outside the scope of rewriting already known system like D&amp;D and Rolemaster. The fact that I started playing with Tore Stuedal, who had started out his campaign years before with D&amp;D, but had developed his game into something completely different (after converting to Rolemaster first), made it natural for me to think in the terms of making my own game (especially since I disagreed with some of the design-choices Tore made).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lowbrowgames</cite>Was the game a success? How much influence did it have on other designers/gamers?</blockquote>It was a success, but not in any commercial way. It was never sold in stores. I played it a lot, and arranged several big convention-sessions in it, and made it a well known part of the Norwegian game-scene. I still remember all the phony "Muu-modules" invented for jest by others: Muu in Flames, James Muu, Muuhammer, World War Muu, etc. Nowadays Muu is more of a legend in Norwegian game-culture.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lowbrowgames</cite>How did the distribution look like? You wrote before about special courses. I'm especially interested because there were many interesting games in 80ties and earlier but because of lack of means of promotion and distribution they didn't break through to mainstream gamers awareness.</blockquote>Distribution? :-) I sold it solely through courses where the muuleaders were educated in the following:<br>- how to set the tone of the game through a method of applied social skills and voice-manipulation.<br>- how to steer the dialog of the game into a muu'ish way of thinking (a poetic-naive language)<br>- how to use the muu-language to immerse the players in a sense of wonder that left them floating in muu'ishness.<br>- how to introduce and use the myths of Muus world (maple syrup, strawberries, Bigmuu, singing) to institute muu'ish player-goals<br>- the doing/action phase<br>- system handling, die rolling<br>- the feeling phase<br>- effects of stronger emotional states<br>- setting the game rythm, maintaining it<br>- the writing of dreams, correcting them, and sharing them<br>- singing; the premises for and performance of muu-songs<br>- starting the game, pausing it, and ending it<br><br>The sales for the game were limited to the participants in these muuleader-courses, so I am in the unique position that I still have the full names of all buyers of the game. The total number of muuleaders in the world are 29 men and women. :-)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lowbrowgames</cite>How do you compare Muu to newest game designs from Norway? What's different?</blockquote>Muu is, in spite of its original elements, a classical roleplaying game with a muuleader (GM) and players, played out with dice-mechanics. Newer design from Norway are different from Muu in all possible ways, and are done in a time where roleplaying games has been through several significant phases of development (even if much is the same still, at least if you visit sites like RPGnet ;-).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lowbrowgames</cite>Did working in kindergarten influence Muu in any way when you're looking back today at the process of design of this game?</blockquote>No. It has nothing to do with children. It is possibly the worst game you can play with children, in spite of the naive feeling of the Muu-world. The game needs mature players to work well. I believe this is due to the subtlety of the game-theme, the strong focus on emotions, and its way of playing with the foundations of our language.<br><i><br><b>CAVE LUDENS!</b></br></i><br>I really enjoyed looking into this game again. Back then I had no confidence in my own ability to write <b>Muu </b>in a way that would enable players to play it the right way. Now I believe my writing skills, and design-skills, are equal to the task. I believe it is time for a new edition of <b>Muu</b>.<br><br>Have a nice day!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164557/#Comment_164557" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T03:51:36+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  3:51AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2008 3:54AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would like to add that as my own way of playing Muu evolved, the game became increasingly relaxed in gameplay.

The harmony I experienced after an ordinary game of Muu is stronger than anything I have felt outside that game. After a muu-game my groups typically sat around smiling very calmly, sharing in the emotional state of harmony.<br><br>No wonder then, that I really <i>love </i>this game!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164575/#Comment_164575" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-23T07:35:48+00:00" title="August 23, 2008  7:35AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read this thread yet, BUT:<br/><br/>Muu was a complete eye-opener for me. It was one of those times when you get the feeling that this is not only a new way of looking at stuff, but it's so way beyond your frame of reference that you're not even sure you know what's going on. This was almost 20 years ago, and role-playing back then was pretty different from what it is now; to me, it seems like contemporary Norwegian role-playing has just caught up with Muu. If I'd seen the game for the first time today, I think I would have been nonplussed at the mixture between old-skool things (movement rates across a hex board) and new poetic techniques (empathy, collective emotions, dreams, song-singing).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
