If I could not use myself and the people I know as a paragon, I wouldn't even be able to portray a character as more than a pawn..<br/>\n<br/>\nThe same goes for the reasons these characters did what they did or didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nReally, isn't ALL narrative, or fantasy or not, a elaboration of actual life? How can you care about a character you don't recognize as human?<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, I think you are talking about something more than that basilar and always present baseline in the reality of the player.

We used to do back-of-the-napkin physics calculations to figure out the motion of falling objects, the mass of giant statues, and so on.  We'd work our biology and chemistry and Boy Scout knowledge to fill out the details about our trips through the wilderness, poisons, and what kinds of ecological niches various monsters might fill.  (The old-school Monstrous Manuals and Elminster's Ecologies books were great for this kind of nerdery, by the way.)<br><br>And in terms of intuitive emotional/social insights, it's probably not a coincidence that the way NPCs and PCs interacted in those games were pretty much the way that teenagers interact.  Yeah, I know.  Scary.<br><br>But that, I think, was where we were coming from back then:  we wanted the setting and mechanics of our game to provide verisimilitude, we wanted to believe that what we knew about how the real world works could be applied to this fictional world.  And possibly vice versa, since I know at least a couple of the kids I played with were pretty gung-ho about getting into medieval re-enactments so they could get their sword-swinging on.<br><br><br>It's actually a <i>new</i> thing (relatively speaking) for me to play in a game where we flat out do not care whether things that make sense in the setting also make sense in real life.  Maybe it's like what JDCorley was talking about earlier, and we are drawing a line to keep our day jobs out of our recreational time: we'd rather wave our hands at a TV- or movie-grade understanding of what we do in real life, and go from there.  We'd rather imagine other kinds of societies and relationships than drag the ones we're already familiar with into the game.<br><br>Even so, I do make some choices that are intuitively informed by real life.  I tend to grab character ideas from whatever I'm currently interested in, and steal details here and there from whatever I'm watching or reading about that interest.  I still find it easiest to get into a setting that differs only slightly from the real, contemporary world.  I typically have no qualms about using things I know to provide color, or even to directly shape the actions of my character.<br><br>The difference these days, as I see it, is that I'm more interested in going after a particular genre, and when given a choice between matching up with genre expectations (shooting a gun at a gas tank in an action movie = EXPLOSION!) or sticking with reality (shooting a gun at a gas tank in real life = a hole in the gas tank, no sparks, no fire, no nothing), I'll go along with the genre without looking back.  I guess that's part of what makes gaming fun for me now, the ability to follow the story even when it stops being "realistic."                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_291509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291509/#Comment_291509" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-03T22:33:24+00:00" title="September  3, 2010 10:33PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2010 11:17PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice take on it, Accounting, but neither your blend of <i>fantasy</i> and real life, nor <i>action</i> and real life, is really what I am talking about. I understand and participate in the gamers escapism too, and enjoy the genre-conventions as much as the next player. Flying away from the mundane, and into the realm fantastic, is one of my favorite pastimes.<br><br>However;<br/>- my thought is that in contemporary fiction we <i>automate</i> a lot more of our setting- and character-interpretation. We may do so due to the drama being close to our everyday life. This intuitive automated creativity is especially strong in modern family dramas, feeding each and every scene in these dramas, with elements from our inner stock of mundane knowledge, human relationships, physical conditions and shifting emotions.<br/><br/>I believe that <i>the way memory works</i>; with elements stored different places in our brains, and built anew each and every time we need them, is very much in play when we take on a fictional character; we use the elements of our memories to build a "real" world around it, and to make the character "come alive" with fictional experiences deeply rooted in our selves. We produce <i>new memories</i>, so to say.<br/>- and that way we may produce <i>a fictional existence</i> which mirrors the qualities of our real life, making the fiction even more acute to us.<br/><br/>My experiences in games with down-to-earth contemporary themes, has led me to think like this, and I do not believe that to be a coincident. In such role-playing games this phenomenon is stronger than in games of more fantastic nature (<i>stronger</i>, mind you; I do believe this phenomenon to be part of all role-playing).<br/><br/>My experience is that modern games of this type often produce scenes of great beauty and intensity, and that they are less limited by <i>our conscious self</i> than the scenes we experience in other genres of role-playing games. Scenes deepened by  intuitive automation are more in tune with our "inner self"; the unconscious soundboard of our identity; and as such they have a greater potential for flow; a greater potential for transforming us into a "true" fictional being.<br/><br/>Or, in other words; the game gets under your skin, even though you often don't understand how it gets there, and even though you do not understand what it is telling you, about yourself and the world around you.

I imagine that everyone does it a little bit, because that's the nature of the brain (and of imagination in general) -- but I don't consciously select parts of my emotional life and use them at the table, and I don't make it a central part of my play.  It's just not the sort of experience I got into gaming for.<br/><br/>I'm more likely to deliberately crib emotions/experiences from fiction than I am to use my everyday life as a source.  Like, if I'm playing a scared teenager in the midst of a zombie apocalypse, I'll adjust my performance to match up with the way scared teenagers act in zombie movies, because my only goal is for the <i>character</i> to be terrified beyond the capacity for rational thought, while I (the player who is sitting at the table) am not only NOT scared, but actually having a really fun time.  If my character was going through a bitter divorce, I would want to be able to <i>enjoy</i> the screaming angry fight with his soon-to-be-ex, make it an interesting scene, and feel good about how it went -- so it's going to be more "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and works of that ilk driving my performance, not memories of real-life exes.  I don't want to step across that line, it would kind of ruin my fun.<br/><br/>But given that my gaming priority is "have fun," I guess it's possible that I might blur that line more for positive emotions.  I dunno, it's not something I've paid much attention to.  It's definitely something I'll think about and look for the next time we play!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_291631">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/291631/#Comment_291631" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-05T09:33:33+00:00" title="September  5, 2010  9:33AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm on a strange planet!

Sad? Resigned?</i><br/>- You actually make the same evaluation of the situation as you would do in real life, and that puts you in the shoes of your character, making immersion the easiest thing you've ever done!<br/><br/>So; by saying these simple things, I've helped you open up a whole can of possible feelings about what is happening: <i>anger, sadness, worry, frustration ...</i> - and this makes it rather easy for you to go on: "Father; what is it? What is wrong?"<br/><br/>Thus we plant our minds and bodies in the tick of <i>interaction</i>, going where no author or movie-director has gone before; into the realm of a fiction in dynamic relation to the feelings you find in the real world; feeding them and being fed by them at the same time (much in the same way as is done in the real world). The degree of realism you get by tapping into this potential of role-playing games, beats anything you may experience in any other media; literature, film, theatre ...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>Annabel gets on very well with me and even better with my wife (but my wife wouldn't let me spend the night at her place by myself).

My idea is that you may build this kind of trust with (almost) anybody, by making games that feed our mutual hunger for trust, and make use of it.<br/><br/>Still; I believe there <span style="text-decoration: underline;">are</span> boundaries to play, real ones, the boundaries that makes us <i>enjoy</i> the pain of our characters, while we feel the <i>pain</i> in us too. Our <i>enjoyment</i> of it stems from our meta-focus, while <i>the pain</i> we share with the character stems from our immersion. However deeply immersed we are, we always keeps a meta-focus in the game, knowing that it is in fact <span style="text-decoration: underline;">a game</span>. This meta-focus let us observe our actions, and keeps our personal integrity intact. We may <span style="text-decoration: underline;">steer</span> the interaction in the directions we want, and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">stop</span> it if it turns sour on us (which, by the way; rarely happens with this kind of games).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>I had Annabel's chr slung in jail and Kaspar's beaten up by her boyfriend because that's where the developments and dice took us.

Lack of immersion makes us put other goals on it; going by abstract standards of "winning" or "fun" or "super-action-hero-unbeatable-EGO". I have nothing against these standards (as part of certain modes of game-play), but they are not conductive to immersing yourself in a role-playing character, and so they are not very interesting as part of the kind of game-play we are discussing here.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: droog</cite>Yes, I have known many young people in those situations (though I also have in mind fictional sources like Mike Leigh's films and the British TV series Shameless).

By reading a book or singing a song I experience one part of reality, and if the book/song is about a place, then I will have an experience of that place, kind of.

And then I believe that you may be proved wrong, by a new and different game, in which most players may find the courage and trust to participate in such game-play. I do not know if such a game is possible, but it is one of my design-goals.<br/><br/>I build my idea on the basis that most people always tries to act in a positive manner towards each other. If you travel, you will meet this positive attitude a lot, due to you having no history with the people you meet. No history = we try to act positive, to see if the stranger respond in kind (bar our prejudice, we always strives for positive relationships). As for people you got a history with, they tend to act according to what they perceive you to be; a friend or foe; a trustworthy individual or an unpredictable threat. So I believe we have as good a chance of playing such a game with strangers, or even a better chance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_292209">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292209/#Comment_292209" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-08T08:53:19+00:00" title="September  8, 2010  8:53AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't have a whole lot to add, but I just want to add my voice as someone who has enjoyed in recent years playing games set in the mundane modern world, for many of the reasons you cite, Tomas.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292487/#Comment_292487" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T08:02:52+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  8:02AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What it becomes at the root for me is that when I play with archetypes and genre conventions, the pain I'm playing with, while not strictly speaking artificial, is still processed and contained.  When I play with my own real-life experiences, the pain is real and dangerous.  So I don't disagree at all with your belief that bringing real-life experiences into games makes the games more intense.  However, there's no guarantee that that intensity will be positive or pleasant.<br/><br/>And because of that, I won't play a game that draws on real pain except with people with whom I'd be willing to talk about that real pain without the filter of the game.  For instance: take a game where one of the conflicts is a gay son trying to reconcile or break off with intolerant relatives and friends.  I have lived that.  I will either play that game with stylized and conventional pain with strangers, or I will play it with real pain with people I know well enough to trust with deeply personal revelations, or I will not play it at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_292544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292544/#Comment_292544" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T09:58:51+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  9:58AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2010 10:01AM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>there's no guarantee that that intensity will be positive or pleasant.</blockquote>It may be <i>unpleasant</i> on some level, yes, as it may be unpleasant to watch a revealing documentary, or to read a novel on a tough theme. We indulge in such films and books because they tell us something of value, about ourself or the world. Role-playing games are capable of doing that too. I find that very interesting.<br/><br/>But it is not hurtful. There are numerous failsafes to guard the players in such games:<br/>- social restraint works to counter excessive pain<br/>- personal integrity works to protect you from it<br/>- as we indulge in it, we still preserve the game-distance, and that protect us from being hurt<br/><br/>These are actual failsafes that have worked for me and all other players I've played with, each and every time we've indulged in the kind of play we are talking about here. So I feel quite confident in claiming that you have reason to expect being <i>hurt</i> in such a game. It may be unpleasant, and challenging, but it is not dangerous. Using your own experiences to support game-fiction is fun and exciting, and sometimes a bit challenging. I see no reason to construe dangers about it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_292610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292610/#Comment_292610" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T11:46:38+00:00" title="September  9, 2010 11:46AM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, you are free to decide what pain you're willing to put up with in the name of entertainment, but PLEASE refrain from telling me what will and won't hurt me, okay?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_292673">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/292673/#Comment_292673" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-09-09T15:30:09+00:00" title="September  9, 2010  3:30PM">September 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 9, 2010 3:32PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Charlton; please do not take my views on this matter as an insult.
