How well I remember it. And how well I remember those first games.  At the time we had really only played modules and module-style adventures in both Call of Cthulhu and D&amp;D.  Fun stuff, but we did it by following the rules.  You remember.  The party will go left at the fork in the road.  If the party goes right, <b>punish them until they go left</b>.  Now we weren't worried about "what would make a good story" then. We were just following the instructions and having a great time.<br/><br/>We got Vampire and a couple of Anne Rice-loving girls wanted to join up and play. Hell yes! We were going to play. We went over to their house. I had never really cared much for Rice. I liked rollicking adventures at the time. But I immediately loved this fucking setup. Nature + Demeanor + Clan was such a cool way of describing characters, a lot like Class + Race + Kit (or whatever) from D&amp;D. So we made characters pretty much in line with the clan stereotypes, got ourselves some modules and went and played them. I don't know if you remember those early Vampire modules.  They were, often, dungeon crawls.  It wasn't until someone actually looked at Chicago By Night and went "wait a second, what the hell did we do here and why is it so great?" that things seriously changed.<br/><br/>Anyway, we played a dungeon crawl, and we really loved it, we got the same kind of things we got from D&amp;D -  plenty of colorful character moments, adventure, supernatural hoohah, badassery, and fighting badguys.<br/><br/>We did another one. Loved that one too. We were diablerists and badasses.  I was playing a Tremere (I usually played 'the wizard' in D&amp;D, so.)  and during all these adventures I was reading through the book and I came to a realization.<br/><br/>So at the end of the next dungeon crawl, I snagged the Macguffin, tricked the rest of the party into staying in the dungeon (I think it was the lair of some ancient Mayan vampire or something) and dynamited the entrance, crushing them to paste and getting a total party kill. Then I went back to civilization and informed the quest-giver, I mean patron, that tragically, only I had survived to bring him the Macguffin and would - with deepest regret - be the one taking the entire payment. <br/><br/>Now, remember, the GM in these games was folloinwg the instructions just like everyone else, and the instructions made clear in Vampire 1ed that the biggest liar and most deceptive backstabber would win in Vampire society, so the GM said "kudos" and gave me the reward and everyone thought that was pretty cool, and they made new characters.<br/><br/>And I did it again.<br/><br/>This was our group's wake up moment. We all went back and looked at the book, and for me at least, I hit my forehead and went "Doh!"  Because Vampire was the first game I ever read that actually, right in its very design, took the railroad out behind the shed and shot it.<br/><br/>How? Because it emphasized extreme diversity in character concepts. You could easily have a Toreador hoity toity artiste, a Ventrue mobster moll, a Tremere nerd, and a Gangrel wandering badass Wolverine clone (as I recall this was our original group).  And there was no way, outside of the dungeon walls, to A) keep this group together, and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> get this group motivated to do something together unless you planned for it.  Those words: "unless you planned for it" were addressed over and over in the text of the book, emphasizing pre-campaign communication and discussion repeatedly.  It was the opposite of every game I'd played in, in which the GM would go home and work up an adventure and world, and the players would pass around the books and - usually silently, to my loud "LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT MY COOL CHARACTER" chagrin - work up their characters with no coordination or communication beyond tactical  concerns. <br/><br/> Hell, tactical concerns? There were a total of four combat skills!  Now, we weren't blown away by having non-combat areas to cover. Call of Cthulhu did that as well.  But once we grasped that "oh shit, we have no reason to hang around or like each other because we didn't design for it", that was when campaign design became important. Really important.<br/><br/>It blows my mind when I hear about "railroaded" Vampire games as somehow being some kind of norm.  Because that goes directly, exactly, against the very design of the game itself, and all the suggestions for how to make characters and how to create situations for them, the game would sabotage your every effort to railroad - characters were powerful, the system ensured they would succeed at virtually everything they tried...  If you don't plan for cohesive characters to be doing something together, you'll be running 5 separate games, and I actually tried that for a while, and it was brilliant, but a bit unsatisfying for a group that loved to banter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142781/#Comment_142781" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-06T23:31:57+00:00" title="May  6, 2008 11:31PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't discover until later how unbelievably flexible the game was, and to a degree, I don't know that White Wolf did either.

It felt like the shackles were off - the characters rampaged through a city, burning, killing, fulfilling their evil purpose.  I think that game probably captured more about the fun of the game than any later attempts.  It was about getting to be this badass character in a complex setting, about not having to follow the boring dusty D&amp;D module, just busting out your Potence on some unsuspecting mortals and getting away with it.<br/><br/>I agree with you about White Wolf not really knowing how to handle their own game.  I feel like the more I read the advice in their books, and the more I tried to follow it, the worse the game got.  My games didn't go the railroady direction (I agree with you that that's not a problem inherent to Vampire), they just became paralysingly slow, over-complex, and angsty (but in a bad way) with me trying to hammer home the emotional point to characters and players who weren't motivated to care.  I think that the game was never good for that type of play, and yet the books told you that was the "right" way to play.<br/><br/>But that's an old point that's been made a million times.  I just wanted to say that I have, on occasion, enjoyed a game of Vampire.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_142929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/142929/#Comment_142929" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-07T12:35:06+00:00" title="May  7, 2008 12:35PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome breakdown of how it broke the mold, JD.  That really models my experience with it across two different groups. White Wolf games (with Vampire as the flagship at the center of it all) systematically kept hitting us over the head until, over the course of 4-6 years or so, started developing really coherent campaigns that let the game shine.<br/><br/>But that's all past tense.

As has been mentioned in other threads, the "faction" element had been introduced in D&amp;D modules like Keep on the Borderlands, and I had even worked up a crude relationship map to help me run those modules.  Chicago by Night had relationship maps, and relationships, at the core of everything it did. I didn't at first notice this.  I was looking at the character stats and figuring out how long it would be until my character was that badass.  But eventually I did work out what it meant, when I designed a plot for the setting. A piece of information would flow relatively quickly and/or freely along lines on the map that were positive, and would be blocked or stymied by lines that were negative. If a piece of information ended up on one side of a negative relationship faster than it ended up on the other side, it would be used to the advantage of the person who got it first and the disadvantage of the person who didn't have it yet.<br/><br/>The same was clearly true of favors, and mysterious occult artifacts, and money and influence and whatever it was that I wanted my plot to be about.  Once I had that worked out, it became clear how to make my own cities and clans and plots and so on.  Unfortunately, I didn't get back to Vampire until Second Edition was out, so I wasn't able to put a lot of the design work I did into practice for a while. Second Edition improved the system, improved the mechanics, but kept it the same core game. And my own interests and awareness of different approaches also improved, including the hobby that would make Vampire one of my favorite games ever: I learned how to wallow in Watergate.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.utexas.edu/features/archive/2005/graphics/watergate7.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143040/#Comment_143040" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T08:40:29+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  8:40AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But before we talk about Watergate, let's back up a minute and talk about some other Vampire "issues" that came up for me between the beginning and the next campaign I actually sat down and ran.<br/><br/>First, Werewolf came out. Although I couldn't put my finger on it right away, what ended up making me not like the game that much was that it lacked flexibility. It seemed, no pun, dogmatic. But I did like that they made them incredibly combat-oriented and enemies of vampires. That way, I thought, they can be seen as fearsome but not trample on the Vampires' niche, which was, as I understood it, deception. I spent the next fifteen fucking years explaining this to idiots on the Internet, that the World of Darkness had made perfectly clear from page one of day one of edition one that for Vampires, physical prowess was secondary, sometimes pathetically secondary, to the power of lies and corruption.  I didn't have any problem with deciding that Werewolves existed in a game, did not exist in a game, or existed but were unimportant in a game. Again, idiots on the Internet did, and many still do.  I found this bizarre and contrary to the stated intent of both games.<br/><br/>Second, TEH INTERNAT. As you will know if you search any Usenet archives back around 1992-1997, I was a real college misanthropist know-it-all jerkoff on the Internet, but I did have a lot of fun because this was during the era when whenever someone would post a change to a game, a proposed alteration, a bug fix, anything, the authors of the game would leap forward to hysterically attack the contributor. It was a wild and woolly time. Giants walked the Earth then, or Michael Scott Brown did, anyway. rec.games.frp.advocacy actually was used for what it had been intended for: "NO U" style flamewars.  I survived the talk.bizarre wall of flames and became an oldbie, posting a Christmas special every year. You kids today don't know how it was back then. Scientists debated with fat goth morons about whether the depiction of science in Mage was fair. <br/><br/>All this fed into my approach towards Vampire (and gaming in general) as I prepared for my next campaign, where I would discover some more new strengths and some weaknesses in the game, bigtime.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow" title="Justin Bow"><img alt="Justin Bow" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Justin%20Bow">Justin Bow</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143052/#Comment_143052" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T09:37:11+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  9:37AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like a lot of aspects in the new Werewolf, I think it's a lot more playable than the previous edition. That said, it bothers me a lot that vampires and werewolves both go into berserker rages as sort of their mechanically-enforced monstrosity. I feel that makes them step on each others' niches. <br/>But I agree with you that vampires have always been the social monsters, the creatures of society and dysfunctional interaction rather than a slightly inhuman force of nature. <br/>I think the major design flaw for Werewolf is actually that the horror isn't internal. You're kind of a monster and that sucks, but you're doing an important job killing evil spirits and making the world nice. It's the WoD mortals campaign except that you're powerful and live in a supportive society of people like you, instead of having to worry about everyone else thinking you're crazy.<br/><br/>Anyway, I think the thing that White Wolf is doing really right with the new Vampire material is putting out a lot about the psychology and society of vampires in a depth that they didn't really go into before. It's certainly inspired our group.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143071/#Comment_143071" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T10:55:14+00:00" title="May  8, 2008 10:55AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Michael Scott Brown</blockquote>\nMan, does that name bring back memories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_143143">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143143/#Comment_143143" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T15:44:19+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  3:44PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 8, 2008 3:53PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've often stated on this and other forums that anyone looking at Vampire and thinking that it would give them what the virtuous young folks call "narrativism" these days must have been completely drunk. What it promised and delivered was Anne Rice-ean nonsense, with a highly flexible system at its core.  And in the source material there was never any real examination of philosophical or moral issues except as a fairly blatant means of dolloping easily-digested intellectual content onto what was essentially a purple-prose Romance romance.  That didn't mean it wasn't important color, but it really wasn't that much at the center of the Rice-ean mythos.  Thus, the Humanity mechanic, while innovative and flexible, wasn't really the center of Vampire either.<br/><br/>(Sorry these updates are coming in smaller chunks than I anticipated, I have a ton of stuff to do before friends get here for Lost tonight.)<br/><br/>Edit: Reference material, bike helmets on to protect you from brain damage: <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=55733" rel="nofollow">Vampire Revised Quickstart Rules</a>, actually a bit better than the full rules in some ways for reasons I'll address soon...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143162">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143162/#Comment_143162" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-08T16:36:56+00:00" title="May  8, 2008  4:36PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Vampire Revised Quickstart Rules, actually a bit better than the full rules in some ways for reasons I'll address soon... </blockquote>\nYes.

There was always something bizarre and creepy which could be added for more atmosphere. Indeed, morons on the Internet tried to put everything possible into their games and were amazed that they suffocated.  I never had this problem.  Instead, even the really crazy supplements were fun for me because I could always pull something insane from them to throw into the game.<br/><br/>And I was really enthused about the political aspects of the game, particularly since I had discovered The Presidental Transcripts, the bound collection of highlights of the Watergate tapes, and was fascinated by the venality and complete backstabbing sonofabitchedness of the Nixon White House. This, said I, was the place to go for political oomph and tomfoolery. (<a href="http://tapes.millercenter.virginia.edu/transcripts/index.php/Main/Nixon" rel="nofollow">Go and learn.</a>)  I also discovered the very very very best "practical" political book of all time, <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/plunkett-george/tammany-hall/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Plunkitt of Tammany Hall</a>, and devoured it eagerly.  <br/><br/>The supplements dealing with Vampire politics were essentially worthless in comparison.  Anyway, i was psyched. I built a volatile situation for the city, with plenty of conflicts of interest and nastiness, and pitched a game to my pals which was going to primarily be about being "fixers", supernatural troubleshooters for the various forces in the city. I figured this would give them the most amount of cohesion, as well as freedom to poke into everyone's various secrets and corners, so that all my great prep work would eventually be on the screen.  The Vampire NPCs were as awful a collection of monsters as ever populated a soap opera.<br/><br/>The players seemed to grasp what I was after, making mostly lighthearted blooddrinkers capable of commenting on, and being astonished and horrified by the terrible things in the situation they were in. We didn't do much personal stuff and we didn't hammer on Humanity that much, we just wanted to mess about with the setting and have some adventures. This the game did with only one single hitch.  I had pitched the game as having political implications, and one of the players looked at the character generation rules and went straight for Backgrounds. Backgrounds permitted him to buy a regular feeding ground, sufficient Status in the vampire community not to have to constantly scrape and bow, enough Resources to keep him safe from mortal scrutiny, and so on.  He basically made a character who had already won Vampire: the Masquerade, and getting him out of his haven and into the thick of it was a hair-pulling nightmare. Backgrounds are cheap, and if you take what the books say about vampire politics and resources as being even remotely accurate, you're a fool not to buy as many of them as you can at the beginning of the game. Ideas for threatening them were, as I recall, even discouraged, since after all, you paid points for them and couldn't actually buy them with XP.  This was a hideous design mistake, but once I recognized it, I could plan for it in the future.<br/><br/>However, the game was, other than this, largely a success, demonstrating another giant advantage of the game: it's highly, highly flexible.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_143387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kynn" title="Kynn"><img alt="Kynn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kynn">Kynn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/143387/#Comment_143387" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-10T07:34:16+00:00" title="May 10, 2008  7:34AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a great thread.

I will return with tales of the 5 years of LARP that I ran. Ah, what great days those were.<br/><br/>One thing I want to mention is that Vampire, throughout all editions, including the most recent, is the same game.  It is exactly the same game.  You have different groups of vampires, some of which you don't have any choice about being a part of and, and others, intersecting like crazy maniacal murderous Venn diagrams where you have a bit more choice, and thus every game has conflict, conflict, conflict built right into it.  <br/><br/>Now lots of Internet morons concern themselves with minutia like whether the first or second or revised edition of this faction or another has changed, how it has changed, and why, but frankly that is a giant waste of time.  From the very first day it was absolutely clear that you could run a game with (par example) 7 bloodlines of Vampires, or 13 (there were originally 13, the legends say), or 2, or 0, or 5 with 2 of them known in the world but Not Appearing In This Game, or 4 in one faction in the city and 2 outlawed to hunting in the fringes of the suburbs, or whatever you wanted. It was blatantly obvious and clear from the start that a lot of the narrative oomf was the fact that Vampire society was <i>arbitrary</i>, that it was not fair, that it was not just, that it had no rules except 2: 1, the Masquerade, okay, everyone pretty much believed that, even those that lied and said they didn't, and 2: <i>what you can get away with</i>.  This was marvelouslly freeing and let you push the aforementioned Humanity system as strong, or weak, as you wanted.<br/><br/>The game has always been like this.  Someone who tried to use every supplement in the game line would inevitably create a shitty game but not because any particular part was shitty, but because you can't possibly fit everything in and have a feasible game.  There was too much in the first damn volume to fit into one game!  Having realized this when I was a sophomore in high school it has baffled me the rest of my gaming career how someone could be so fucking idiotic as to think Vampire was anything other than a toolkit for making Vampire games.  But plenty of people have, and they struggle and fight to fit every single piece into some kind of cohesive whole and give that to the players.  <i>Nobody ever told them to do that and plenty of times they were told not to.</i><br/><br/>Anyway, there will be more later as time goes on, but right now I'm working a bit on an actual game!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145021">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145021/#Comment_145021" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-20T05:59:02+00:00" title="May 20, 2008  5:59AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            These essays are awesome.

We started right when the first LARP rules came out, kicking off the group with a Con game.<br/><br/>What I learned at that very first Con game was that even with very clear objectives and a crushingly simple plotline, the multiplication of factions can make any plot have all the twists and turns necessary to satisfy.  The plot at this, my first LARP, was about the murder of a Vampire and the recovery of a computer disk reputed to contain mysterious occult writings on it. There were three main power groups seeking it, one smaller group attempting to bury it, and my group, which was opposed to all of them. Two of the main power groups allied early on, and crushed most of the opposition, but the smaller, bury-the-disk group got this idea and sent someone offsite to buy a computer disk, which they then marked appropriately, and sold to the alliance. After the alliance would check the disk (on a real computer set up in someone's hotel room), and discover it was blank, they would set it aside, whereupon I would sneakily palm the blank disk, go back out into the hotel and sell it (or give it) to someone else, who would think they had the game-winning mcguffin and would run back to the alliance to check it out, they'd check out the same disk again, exclude it, I would grab it again, and go seed it again, over and over. It was hilarious - especially once they figured out it was me. I can still remember the hotel door closing behind me while a female voice, the light dawning, yelled, "Wait..WAIT, STOP HIM!!"<br/><br/>The Vampire LARP book had a lot of rules we considered very strange. For example, service to the game (hosting, setting up, cleaning up, etc. ) was rewarded with your character gaining Generation, which in the tabletop game was a powerful indicator of how far your Vampire was from the original vampire progenitor and could not be changed without embarking on a truly despicable deed to destroy a more powerful vampire and absorb their soul. We could grasp giving in-character rewards for doing out-of-character things - what else did a game have to give? - but Generation seemed totally bizarre. A Vampire embraced by another could soon have a lower Generation than the sire did if they helped the game a few months.<br/><br/>So we made some changes - service to the game would be, for the moment, its own reward. We didn't have any shortage of people willing to help.  Most important, we made the conscious decision that it would be a fairly low-powered game, in terms of starting characters, even for those claiming important roles in the city. Everyone was vulnerable, everyone had come to Tucson from far away, usually because they got screwed in those towns.  And because we weren't handing out Generation, the most powerful characters and the least powerful would not be very different.  We created an initial situation with two warring factions tussling it out for leadership and launched the game before we really knew what we were doing. It exploded like a beautiful, backstabbing firework. It was gorgeous.<br/><br/>A few problems immediately presented themselves and, with more luck than skill, we hit on solutions that were astonishingly above our level of competence and the level of most people who ran LARPs in those days:<br/><br/>1 - Shared Universes. There were at least four shared universes that came knocking to ask if we wanted our game to join up with theirs. We always said the same thing: "Fine, but we keep complete control over our game, you can't bring your super-powered character here and expect us to just let them walk in." and we mentioned we didn't hand out Generation for game service and that was the end of that. Even when White Wolf launched its "official" shared universe, we didn't even really look at it that closely, we only noted that their guidelines would have made virtually everything good about our game completely impossible, and moved on.<br/><br/>2 - Visitors. A similar situation. Visitors from other towns/games who wanted to play their character were politely told we would be rewriting them or giving them an NPC to play. Only one visitor out of perhaps 20 over 5 years elected to have his character temporarily powered-down to play in our game and he told us it was approximately a trillion times better than playing his character in his home game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145292">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145292/#Comment_145292" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T08:23:23+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  8:23AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The NPC thing was equally problematic, because nowhere in the books did it tell people to do what every other LARP on Earth apparently thought was required. If you have too many GMs, the books said, give them a NPC to play, but it did NOT say "and make them super duper powerful". We read it and thought, "Oh, this is our chance to show off how great the PCs are, and would inevitably make NPCs that were the minions, contacts, allies, and/or snivelling enemies of particular PCs, so they could get a bit brighter spotlight - the only conceivable purpose of having GMs, we thought. When we did hand out superpowered NPCs, we gave them to people who were at the game for the first time, and made sure that all the PCs had some relationship with them, something they wanted, or didn't want, or something. That way they had a constant wave of PCs giving them attention and they would want to stay.<br/><br/>(We also had our "twink inoculation" characters, for new players who insisted on playing a super-duper-mega-powered character ("twinks", from online parlance). We would say, for example, "Caine and all the Third Generation vampires are already assigned, would you like to play Merlin?" and give them a character who was deluded into thinking they were the reincarnation of a powerful magician. This was always one hundred percent fun and the player would never ever feel bad that we didn't let them play their mega-powerful characters ever again, and their recurring character would be of the appropriate level and they would jump right in.)<br/><br/>Visitors tended to fall into the first category - the ones we wanted to assign support NPCs to. The ones that agreed walked out with their minds blown, since they were treated in a way they never got to experience in their home games. Imagine being a part of an improv troupe but you never ever get to play anything but the straight-man authority figure. Then you show up one day and suddenly you're the wacky taxi driver. It's relieving and eye-opening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145335">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145335/#Comment_145335" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T12:20:22+00:00" title="May 21, 2008 12:20PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We also ran one-shot LARPs at the local con throughout this time - indeed, there was even a second Con in Tucson, gaming-specalized, where we ran LARPs too, which led to one of my proudest moments in gaming, successfully running a 2-night, 40-player con LARP.  Basically the plot was "evil occult auction" with everyone divided into 15-20 2-3-character teams, each of which was assigned a list of things they wanted and resources they had. Thus everyone had a RP partner, everyone had a clear goal and everyone had a bunch of cool stuff nobody else had, so that they could bid at the auction, or backstab and wheedle and bribe each other, which everyone did with incredible aplomb.  I also had "scheduled feedings", each team had an appointment with a "hunt" GM, who had pre-written "you leave the auction to go hunt and find some blood" scenarios for each of them.  This added another layer of strategy as if you had an early hunt time, you wanted to get a lot of physical stuff out of the way early, but if you had a late hunt time you wanted to conserve your vampire powahz. <br/><br/>It was a grand success. Even my wife, who normally plays "caraaaaazy" characters had a great time playing a Southern hoity toity vampire with a dumb redneck sidekick.  "Hush up now, Edgah!" I can hear her say, followed by the college kid's "Yesma'am."  The Russian team sounded like Boris and Natasha. The Malkavian team held a counter-auction with essentially things they took out of their garbage, before pretending to be a different team entirely. The Sabbat team spent the first day pushing everyone around, and the second day getting kicked like a soccer ball.  At the recap, everyone was grinning.<br/><br/>That brings me to something else we always did in both con and ongoing LARPs: the out-of-character recap. This was where everyone sat down with coffee/late dinner and went obsessively over and over everything that had happened, laughing at their characters' ignorance or misfortune, and bonding as players. I think this helped a lot of the more misfit players who had the LARP as their main social intercourse with the world, I truly do. You had to set boundaries, but having this allowed us to set them in a natural, but still organized way.  And I think this was a great feature of our LARP, that we always, after three or four hours of murdering each other, got together and said "good game, what should we do NEXT?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145337">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145337/#Comment_145337" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T12:42:14+00:00" title="May 21, 2008 12:42PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            wow.  i've always heard things about LARPs, especially WW LARPs, that have generally made me think "Ugh.

I'm a little confused what exactly you did. Was the character not really very powerful, but just thought that he was?</blockquote>\nThat's it exactly. The character was actually essentially useless in the areas he thought he was powerful.<br/><br/>I will tell a story about this now.<br/><br/>It was at one of the Con games. The player was about 17 years old. He approached the GM table. "Can I play an elder, or maybe an Abomination?" he asked.  The latter was a half-vampire, half-werewolf, the request for which was always a red flag. Not that it was inherently a bad or unusuable idea, it was just a bad sign. We immediately replied with our usual "Jesus and Caine are both already assigned to people, would you like to play Merlin?" He blinked, thinking he was getting a Mage character or a powerful Tremere (vampire wizzard).  Instead he got Ambrose, the guy who thought he was Merlin.  I kept an eye on him reading the character packet. At first he was puzzled. For one thing his character packet was really thin, and normally characters with special powers needed a lot of paper for extra special rules and such.  Then he "got it" and a big grin spread over his face.<br/><br/>As soon as the game turned on, he immediately and imperiously walked over to the occult-knowledgeable vampires and introduced himself as the greatest mind of the age on matters magical and occult.  He spoke with such calmness and confidence that they accepted him as one of their own. Now as a GM you are in the position to overhear a lot of things, and this guy would listen in on a conversation, stroke his chin thoughtfully, and then pontificate coolly but really obviously pointlessly on a topic, but because he was so calm about it, everyone took it at face value and began to trust him, although he was actually telling them "I don't know anything, I am crazy", they were hearing Deep Thoughts.  This dichotomy is the core of the vampire group he was actually a part of. <br/><br/>The plot involved a vampire murder and subsequent power struggle. One thing became a big question. Someone had found ashes that used to be a vampire in a hotel room and there was considerable debate about how to figure out if they were the ashes of a particular vampire. The occult group was called in to consult. They debated this and that and cutting deals with him or her, and Ambrose finally stepped forward and said with utter confidence "I can perform a ritual that will obtain the answer you require." They handed him the bag with the ashes. He stepped inside the hotel bathroom, stating, "The ritual requires privacy." They let him go. They heard the door lock. Suddenly we hear Ambrose begin to spew Satanic gibberish, growing louder and louder, more and more wild and chaotic and then....<br/><br/>FLUUSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br/><br/>Pandemonium breaks out, everyone is screaming at the GMs that they want to break down the door and stop him, the GMs are laughing so hard they can't respond, and inside, oblivious, Ambrose is continuing to spout gibberish and repeatedly flush the toilet. Just as the GMs get it together enough to respond to the requests to break down the door, Ambrose opens the door and is completely calm and composed. He throws away the now-empty plastic bag and gives the angry huge guy who was about to break down the door a <i>look</i> and then turns on the sink. He leans over the sink. Everyone is screaming at him and us.<br/><br/>Ambrose looks vexed for the first time, raises a hand. "Please." he says. "I'm trying to listen to the water spirits."<br/><br/>He leans back down in the shocked silence that follows, nods calmly, makes a few notations on his notepad, then stands up straight and confident and says "The ashes did in fact belong to the Prince. I thank you for the opportunity to serve." <br/><br/>The GMs just couldn't stop laughing - because Ambrose was <i>right.</i><br/><br/>After the game everyone was talking him up about how great he was and how wonderfully he had everyone fooled - some, even after this incident! And the player had discovered a new kind of narrative power - trickery.  He joined our ongoing game with a properly low-power character and never looked back.<br/><br/>Edit: In essence, Ambrose allows you virtually all the thrills of playing a powerful character without actually imposing the costs of an unbalanced character on others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145353">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145353/#Comment_145353" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T13:39:28+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  1:39PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh god, I'm having trouble breathing over here.

I should note that we recycled about 50-75 pregenerated vampire characters into various combinations for the con games.<br/><br/>This time Ambrose was not played by a twink needing curing, but instead by a LARP regular. He was a guy who would eventually leave Tucson for a chance to star in a backyard wrestling video. That tells you what you need to know about him.  And Tucson. Gads, I love Tucson.  <br/><br/>He was assigned Ambrose as the "leader" of the Malkavian team in the auction. They had a few things they wanted to get, a longer list of things they wanted to <i>stop others</i> from getting, and their only resource was, and this is a quote: "a suitcase full of money you found in your hotel room that you don't know how it got there".  Ambrose did all kinds of wonderfully disruptive things but when they hatched the idea of the "counter-auction" on the second night, he produced and held up in his hand an audiotape. Now, remember, the GMs have never seen this tape before. Ambrose declares that this audiotape will make you the greatest Mage in the world and he will sell it for one hundred thousand American dollars.<br/><br/>Finally one of the Tremere team can't take Ambrose's taunting anymore, so they pass over the money and Ambrose gives them the tape.<br/><br/>Written on the outside of the tape is: "To become the greatest Mage in the world you must listen to all four minutes and eighteen seconds of this tape, if you do not, your head will explode. I DO NOT MAKE THE RULES I JUST WRITE THEM DOWN OK??"<br/><br/>The Tremere guy puts on a walkman and listens. Before the end he has collapsed in paroxysms of laughter. In the end, he hands the tape over to the GMs who insist on being next, saying his purchase was totally worth it.<br/><br/>Here is what the tape said, in a very intent, stoner voice (the highlights, obviously it was longer):<br/><br/>"You are the greatest mage in the world.<br/>You are the greatest mage ever.<br/><br/>You can walk out of a movie before it's over. You already know how it will end.<br/>Because you are the greatest mage in the world.<br/><br/>You never have to worry about having cigarettes....or food....or ANYTHING.<br/>Because you are the greatest mage ever.<br/><br/>You always win NHL 98 on Sega.<br/>Because you are the greatest mage in the world.<br/><br/>You always have a ride.<br/>Because you are the greatest mage ever.<br/><br/>How many fingers am I holding up?<br/>That's right.<br/>Because you are the greatest mage in the world.<br/><br/>What number am I thinking of?<br/>That's correct.<br/>Because you are the greatest mage ever.<br/><br/>(one minute pause)<br/><br/>Ha ha ha, sucker! <i>I</i> am the greatest mage in the world!!!"<br/><br/>It helped a lot to see the tattooed, skinny, whitebread Ambrose standing there looking totally solemn while you listened. The punch line of never needing "cigarettes...or food...or ANYTHING" was just priceless. Of course that's how his version of Ambrose would divide material needs.  And he wouldn't say "you have a car", he would say "you always have a ride".  It was marvelously in-character, and added to so much by the player's out-of-character personality and background.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145377/#Comment_145377" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T16:38:17+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  4:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never EVER wanted to play in a Vampire live, even though I have many friends with fond (evil) memories of some.<br/><br/>I'd want to play in one of yours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145382/#Comment_145382" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-21T17:18:29+00:00" title="May 21, 2008  5:18PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am actually trying to find a Vampire LARP to join at my city, since I have never been able to play in one so far...

I wouldn't say they were "deep" or anything, but as amateur dramatics, which is, again, all the game ever promised, they were excellent, on par with the very best I've experienced in the hobby and certainly on par with the genre fiction that the game set out to emulate (and even better than much of it!)<br/><br/>And all this, all this experience, years and years of great play in many different styles from rowdy violence to gloomy politicking to emo shoegazing to straightfaced satire, with different groups of different sizes and different desires in different contexts, is why I knew, knew in my heart, as soon as I read that first Forge essay where it reached the conclusion Vampire was a horrible, player-power-struggle game that would inevitably lead to "dysfunction" (haw) due to "incoherence" (haw haw haw), that this theory, and all its diseased and stunted progeny, was a giant waste of time.<br/><br/>I will now answer all your angry retorts and tentative questions about Vampire.

That's like the old line from the tech world "that's not a bug...its a feature!"  Where you're seeing the features of a tool kit, I'm seeing the bugs of an underdesigned game.<br/>\n<br/>\nGURPS is a game that was designed to be a tool kit.  HERO is a game that was designed to be a toolkit.  Good or bad they made certain design choices intentionally for purposes of it being a tool kit.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not buying that Vampire was a game designed to be a tool kit.  The holes in the rules are not of the "insert your own customized GM / group preferences here" variety.  They're of the "totally absent and relying on the good will of the players to figure out on their own" variety.<br/>\n<br/>\nVampire was a setting book.  It was a great setting book...I was certainly enthused by it.  It had a basic set of medium crunch dice mechanics tacked on to it that weren't half bad.  But it had very little in the way of how to use those mechanics to deliver the kind of play that the flavor text promised (I say "little" to cover myself, because my inclination is to say "none" but its been a while since I cracked one of those books and don't want to overstate it).<br/>\n<br/>\nYou read the flavor text, said "this is what the game is supposed to feel like in play...now I'm going to design the set of techniques we're going to use to deliver that feeling".  I did the same...or rather the GM who ran the game for us did and we eagerly went along.  My point is...and the whole point of "system matters" is that we shouldn't have had to design that...it should already have been designed...because that's what a designer's job is...to design the rules to deliver the desired feel of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo no, I don't give credit to a game that we had to write / rewrite half of ourselves to make it work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145478/#Comment_145478" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T11:53:01+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 11:53AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2008 11:54AM by Andy.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, with the latter replies, these essays on Vampire smell like a very poignant counter-argument/example to "System Matters" essays: Seeped in experiences easily related to, with one's take on how it all fits together.<br><br>Anyway, JD's posts, and others' replies, are providing quite a bit of fuel for my brain.<br><br>I'm thinking the Game vs Toolkit discussion is weighty and awesome, and probably will end up needing its own thread in order to not derail this one too much.

One of the huge critiques of Vampire at the time of both 1st and 2nd Edition was that it spent <i>too much</i> time telling you how to play in various ways... remember all those essays at the back, by different authors? The whole Player's Guide and Storyteller's Guide from start to finish?  Each and every section of each and every supplement that talked about "Theme"s and "Tone"s, all of which were different? Since all those people clearly had different ways of approaching the material, and the material was presented from all sorts of different angles, I have a hard time thinking that I was NOT supposed to think about how my game would approach it.<br><br>I mean, yes, the mechanics were task resolution oriented, but to say "well, the game just relied on good campaign design and GMing" as if it provided nothing whatsoever to assist with those tasks is addleheaded.  The factionalized situation + the arbitrary nature of society + the common goal of the Masquerade = conflict, which is at the core of good campaign design and GMing. The whole game was created so that you would have a lot of material that contributed to good campaign design and GMing. And - here is the thing that blows my mind - when you admit that your group experienced good campaign design and GMing, you say "but it can't possibly have been <i>designed</i> that way", and then accuse <i>me</i> of being the one that discounts designer contribution to game experience!                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marco" title="Marco"><img alt="Marco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marco">Marco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145495/#Comment_145495" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T12:17:32+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 12:17PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a lot of GURPS V:tM.

No role playing, no immersion, no story. Pure munchkin's power play. They say it is right there on the rules. And yes, the rules could lead you there. I emphasize the <i>could</i>.<br/><br/>You could also create a very narrative, interesting, not powerplayed game by playing <b>by the rules</b>. No, no house rules, no rewriting the game, no big breakthroughs. Just the plain, simple and <i>as written</i> books.<br/><br/>Sure, the argument could be that the game was not designed to be played as such, and that <b>I </b>make it work that way. But the game still works for me. It does provide me (and most people I game with) with the kind of experience I like and enjoy.<br/><br/>System matters, but only as far as you can make it work. Sure, if I have to start from scratch, then I picked the wrong system. But sometimes we get too caught up with how the game "tells you to play", and forget about what we can do with it as it is.<br/><br/>Of course, I too see it as a toolkit, and not a Definitive Guide of How to Play Right. I do not see "skipping some of the rules that don't fit my style" as a reason to say a system doesn't work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145516">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145516/#Comment_145516" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T14:08:31+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  2:08PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2008 2:12PM by Johnstone.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, it looks like the Jason/Ralph disconnect here is over different parts of the rules.<br/><br/>What Jason says: The Vampire books said play a political game with R-maps, backstabbery, and players inventing reasons for their characters to hang out. So we played that and it was "teh r0xx0r." All that expository text that tells you how to play Vampire? Jason read it, took it at face value and played the game that way. In a nutshell - right Jason?<br/><br/>What Ralph says: Yeah, but the rules for rolling dice, and how the rules say those numbers on the character sheet work, and how the rules define tasks and conflicts and stuff? It's a different game. It doesn't create the kind of play that the expository text describes. If you take the mechanical rules at face value they don't create a political game with R-maps, backstabbery, and players inventing reasons for their characters to hang out. And it's not a toolkit - you have to use everything, because, yeah, they put that Golden Rule (ignore the rules if you want to) at the front of the core book, and nowhere in Clanbook:Setite (for example).<br/><br/><br/>I've had fun times and bad times with Vampire. The system, the hard mechanics, they really do suck. They fucking suck ass. I could break them down and poop all over each part individually, even. But the expository text, and the R-maps in the city books are part of the rules, too. They could be written out better, yeah, and they could have procedural rules to back them up, but Jason is proof that they gave people something a lot of other games didn't. Ralph can argue that they are just setting books, but that stuff is still part of the rules and the system.<br/><br/>So Jason had a good time with it, does that make it a good game? No. So Tucson had a good time with it, does that make it a good game? No. If everybody had a good time with it, provided they didn't hate vampires, would that make it a good game? Yes. But I've been there to see the bad habits come out that a slightly-better-crafted game could have easily quashed.<br/><br/>And then I could have been playing games that were like Jason's. Jesus, that's funny stuff!<br/><br/>It was big, it changed roleplaying, and still, it could be a better game. Is it so wrong to say that?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145521/#Comment_145521" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T14:21:50+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  2:21PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2008 2:23PM by Valamir.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD, we're apparently speaking two completely different languages here.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm specifically NOT talking about wanting more of the reams of how to play text that you mention above.  That text is what I referred to as the "flavor" text...the text that told us what a game of Vampire was SUPPOSED to feel like.  What the game didn't provide was instructions on how to use the mechanics of the game to deliver that flavor.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor proof of this you need look no further than the ease with which a Vampire game can shift from table top to LARP using an entirely different set of mechanics altogether...and capture the exact same feel / flavor / tone / mood / whatever.  In other words...the actual rules didn't contribute much of anything to that feel or flavor...if they did you wouldn't be able to so easily set them aside without losing anything.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a great setting book.  You could take nearly any set of mechanics you wanted and plug them into that setting and play...and as long as you had a GM who delivered the tone and theme and feel it wouldn't matter what rules you were using...because the rules in Vampire didn't matter.  They were best when they simply got out of the way and let the masterful GM work his magic...and that's a crappy design.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy is it a crappy design?  Because a masterful GM can work his magic with anything.  WW could have published the exact same set of books, with all the identical flavor text...but deleted the rules altogether and just marketed it as a "sourcebook for your favorite game" and the masterful GMs of the world such as yourself would have delivered the exact same quality of play experience.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo while, your ability to achieve great play with the thing you're calling Vampire: The Masquerade is fantastic evidence of your personal skill and that of the extended LARP team you worked with...it says little about the quality of the game design itself.  Its says great things about what they WANTED to deliver with the game.  But what was actually delivered?<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't think I'm saying anything different from you here...I'm just calling a spade a spade.  You open up above with a discussion of Chicago by Night...one of the greatest game sourcebooks of all time.  Better by far than Cyberpunk's Night City, and I'd thought Night City was the bomb.  Because Chicago by Night delivered a fantastic setting, juicy situations, compelling characters...all of the stuff you can BUILD a great game out of.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't consider that in any way shape or form great game design...I consider that great setting design.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo examine the quality of the GAME you have to look at the actual rules both for dice and for procedures of play.  The dice rules were a solidly passable dice pool, nothing too exciting but functional...but they added little to the themes of play.  Humanity and Blood Pools and Generations were attempts at tieing the dice to theme but they were awkward and clunky at best and...much like the weapon vs. armor rules of AD&amp;D; among the first rules to get thrown out, ignored in practice, or housed into something better.  And procedurally...and here I'm talking about what we now have lingo to discuss...things like distribution of authority, IIEE concerns, and the like...pretty much nothing.  The rules procedurally relied upon decades of "this is how you roleplay" tradition.<br/>\n<br/>\nProblem is, that the "this is how you roleplay" tradition was predominantly developed to promote dungeon crawls and proved largely inadequate to the task of running the much more sophisticated story lines of Vampire.  Trying to run the more sophisticated story lines of Vampire using old school "how to roleplay" tradition (all the more problematical because that tradition presumed party play, which as you note Vampire didn't require)...places you squarely on the road to dysfunctional play.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome...even many...GMs were skillful enough to invent their own procedures and techniques for "how to play" and so wound up essentially reengineering the entire game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I see it, the primary difference between your position and mine is that despite all your reengineering you still want to say you were playing "Vampire: The Masquerade"...and I'm saying...no...you were playing "Vampire: The Jason Corley Edition".<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Jason Corley Edition sounds like it rawked hard.<br/>\n<br/>\nedit:  Xposted with John...yes exactly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145545">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145545/#Comment_145545" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T17:03:35+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  5:03PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            question for you folks.  most of this talk has been about 1st or 2nd ed vampire, right?  2nd ed. Vampire is 16 years old.  Does anyone have any experience with playing or even reading the nWoD stuff?  if so, has it improved, gotten worse, or is it just more of the same?  i've got the nWoD and 2nd ed. books, and while I've read them both and have my own opinions, my direct experience with actual play is very limited... so i'm curious as to what the experts think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145552">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145552/#Comment_145552" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T17:38:30+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  5:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 22, 2008 5:41PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            nWoD's basic dice mechanics are a huge, dramatic, amazing improvement over 2nd edition's (in that the things that annoyed me about the old system seem to be gone for good now), and the setting books have the same "here's a bunch of interesting and cool stuff you can put into your game" goodness of the oWoD.  So yes, it's an improvement, and a fun game.  It has slightly different interesting and cool stuff, mind you, so if you had an unnatural attachment to some of the oWoD material, you'll probably find some reasons to whine about it.<br><br><br>Referring back to Valamir's rant about Vampire's "crappy design," I can only assume that he hasn't seen many games where the rules were genuinely crappy.  The old Storyteller system had flaws -- jesus, just look at how fucked up the combat rules were, or the problems inherent in the old "1's subtract from successes" rule, or the way difficulty numbers were manipulated -- but those flaws didn't make it a crappy system, it made it a slightly-below-average system.  It wasn't fundamentally broken, and it wasn't impossible to use in a game.  Generally, when our group was playing it I'd guesstimate that we were using anywhere from 60-80% of the rules as written, and most of our house rules were minor tweaks and adjustments.  A truly crappy design can't be playable with minor tweaks and adjustments, it requires a massive overhaul and possibly hunting down and shooting the designers in retribution.<br><br>It's better to say that old-style Storyteller was a weak system, I think; it was definitely a system that encouraged you to consider how to use the rules to suit your group's tastes at the same time that the setting material was telling you to use only the parts of the setting that suited your game.  For folks coming out of hardcore module-play D&amp;D, it was like manna from heaven.  Hell, if it was a truly crappy system, it wouldn't have been worth the effort to tinker with: you'd just swipe whatever setting elements you liked and throw them into some other game.  And maybe you did that, I don't know...sometimes I really can't comprehend what some people like or dislike.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145554">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145554/#Comment_145554" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T17:45:15+00:00" title="May 22, 2008  5:45PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am baffled as to the division between setting design and game design. Setting design is crucial, absolutely crucial to game design, especially if you're using a task resolution system and a central authority for the setting. Strong setting design is strong game design. It just is. Settings have to be playtested, they have to be worked on, good settings just don't "happen", good settings are hugely important and without them there's no way you can get good characters and no way you can get good conflicts.  Even setting-building games like Primetime Adventures recognize this - you have to establish the world the characters come from and live in so that you can see where they're going and why.  As story generation material, what Vampire gave you, whether it was dice or decision or central authority and players playing a character, was pure gold.<br><br>If the mechanics are bad (and they sure as heck weren't good in 1st Edition, they were better in 2nd, still better in Revised and now are quite slick in Requiem), okay. That is a good topic. As I noted there were places where the mechanics fucked up the game a bit (underpriced Backgrounds for the importance they were supposed to have). There were other mechanics that were problematic (the designers themselves seemed to forget about tenets of the system like "2 successes is a complete success" later in the life of the game). Still other mechanics (Humanity, Generation) were brilliantly tailored to the game and very effective in a wide variety of ways.  You say these were modded for what individual groups did <i>as if this was some kind of bad thing about them</i>. What's the alternative? A system you can't change without screwing things up? If that's the pinnacle of good design, holy shit, sign me up for another hobby, like being hit with sticks over and over.<br><br>The "how you roleplay" stuff was actually very strong in the essays of both 1st and 2nd Edition's essay section. It had to be, plenty of people were buying the game that were never interested in D&amp;D. It didn't talk much about the system, but why would it? The system was task resolution, it was going to tell you whether you did what you wanted, it didn't tell you how to decide what you wanted, that was the roleplay part.  It included ideas for troupe play, rotating GMs, GMless play (especially the LARP rules did this), all sorts of weird optional things you could try.  To say it was "my" Vampire that was cool and not "theirs" is to deny that they accomplished what they set out to accomplish - to give people the tools to run something like I ran.  What other conceivable purpose was there for task resolution, GMs, and players with singular characters that were "theirs"?  If they wanted me to run a game a particular way, why didn't they eliminate the GM position entirely?<br><br>There's of course plenty of things that could have gone better, as I noted.  But it was still just a really terrific game.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145597/#Comment_145597" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-22T22:25:51+00:00" title="May 22, 2008 10:25PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I never said setting design isn't crucial.

It was pretty good, in many cases, yes, and it was a welcome change for the massive, massive stress it placed on dramatic roleplaying. But the integration between setting and mechanics is where it really breaks down.<br/><br/>Lemmee stress that again - the relation between mediocre mechanics and above-average setting was very poorly done.<br/><br/><br/>A shining example of poor mechanics sabotaging brilliant roleplaying advice:<br/><br/>Vampire put a major emphasis on scenes. Units of time were split into scenes. The GM was told to organize scenes, not dungeon rooms. Your powers would last for a full scene - not 2dX minutes or 2x a day spellcasting. Spend some blood points, get extra strength for a scene, etc.<br/><br/>And then comes the rule - you lose 1 Blood Point per day. Great, now I have to keep track of days. Not scenes, days. If I follow the rules here, I need to know exactly how many days go by in any stretch of downtime, and active game-time is inevitably gonna be measured in days. Oh, but then they "fixed" this, in the Storyteller's Guide (I think). After downtime, you just roll 1d10 and that's how many Blood Points you start with. Great, so then the GM skips ahead a week after I went to a lot of trouble to have 8 BP in my pool and now I roll a 1, so the first thing I gotta do is hunt, before we can get to the politics and the cool roleplaying stuff.<br/><br/>Blood Pool loss should have been entirely scene-based.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Still other mechanics (Humanity, Generation) were brilliantly tailored to the game and very effective in a wide variety of ways.</blockquote>\nHumanity was a punishment mechanic, while Nature/Demeanor was a reward mechanic - explicitly a punishment or reward for roleplaying. Problem is, you got punished way, way more than you got rewarded (nWoD is much less stingy with Willpower rewards for Nature/Demeanor).<br/><br/>So you have a stingy WP award for exceptional rping to mechanically drive play, vs. Humanity, Blood Points, Frenzy and evil NPCs to mechanically punish the player.<br/><br/><br/>And I could go on. Maybe later I will, which is not something I'll do for the <i>actual</i> "many games where the rules were genuinely crappy."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145612">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145612/#Comment_145612" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T00:41:12+00:00" title="May 23, 2008 12:41AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2008 12:43AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>You say these were modded for what individual groups did <i>as if this was some kind of bad thing about them</i>.

Setting is one of the pillars of exploration.  There are many ways to deliver setting effectively.  Vampire did it with tons of text, evocate art, and short fiction.  Burning Wheel does it with life paths and virtually no explicit setting material.  Shadow of Yesterday gives only a sketchy setting in the text but really drives the cultures home with keys and secrets.  So absolutely...tons of different ways to accomplish this.<br/>\n<br/>\nStrong GM Talents:  If you'd phrased this as "gives the GM the tools they need to run a strong game" I'd be all over it.  If you'd phrased this as "helps the GM develop the specific skill set they'll need to run this game well"...I don't know that I've seen that yet, but I'd welcome it.  However, if by this you mean "master GMs only, those without the special magic need not apply" then not so much.  That isn't design in my book, that's partial design leaving the GM to fill in the rest.  A GM who's capable of filling in the rest, might as well just fill in the whole thing and not waste their money on a half finished design.<br/>\n<br/>\nActor Stance:  I'm totally cool with actor stance.  I believe very strongly that there's no such thing as All Actor Stance All the Time and never has been.  Its a "pretend ideal" like chivalry...something to hold out as an example even though it never really existed.  Back before the Forge closed the theory forums down I had an extensive series of PMs with a die hard immersionist player who swore that Author Stance was immersion breaking.  Several PMs later with him responding to my questions about how they actually play, he concluded..."huh...I guess we actually spend most of our time in Author Stance, don't we".  So, lot's of Actor Stance...yes.  Actor Stance with language that essentially forbids Author Stance (even when those terms are unknown to the writer) is a myth that doesn't exist, but pretending it does has a pretty damaging history.<br/>\n<br/>\nTask resolution that mostly stays out of your way:  That's a cop out to me.  The desire for that is predicated on a false assumption.  That assumption being that too much contact with mechanics always breaks immersion, or flow, or interferes with creativity, or whatever.  I think that's another one of those "Everybody knows its true" rules of thumb that's been accepted by parts of gamerdom so long its not even questioned.  Say rather "Task Resolution that actively supports and enhances the goals of the game" and I'm totally there.  Say "Task Resolution that gets out of your way" and I'll say its only necessary for it to get out of your way when its designed poorly to begin with.  Note for clarity:  by saying that a goal to have it get out of your way is unnecessary, I'm NOT saying that it needs to be in your face all the time.  But if "getting out of the way" is the best a designer can do...because they lack the ability / desire / patience* to design mechanics that actually enhance their goal...then IMO they're better off just designing a setting book and leaving mechanics design to others. (* and by patience I mean that it takes a TON of aggressive playtesting of the "not very much fun variety" to design a set of mechanics that enhances the design goals without falling into the easy pitfalls.  For those who aren't willing to do this, they can take the easy way out by just designing get-out-of-the-way rules...but that's setting the design bar pretty low.  So...no I don't think a game with a bar set that low can by definition ever be great.<br/>\n<br/>\nMetagame.  That depends.  If the reason the designer wants to limit metagame is because they believe it interferes with immersion and in-character play, then I'd say that's another false assumption, and I don't support design goals founded on erroneous principals.  However, there are potentially many valid reasons that a specific design application could have to promote meta game mechanics, limit them, use only certain types, etc.  So if there was a design goal that was well served by the idea of "no meta game" then I'm all for seeing it developed.  However, if its just another "meta-game hurts immersion" design...then not so much.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145643/#Comment_145643" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T07:44:56+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  7:44AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>Humanity was a punishment mechanic,</blockquote>\nWhoa, stop right there. No sir it was not a punishment mechanic. People gleefully, eagerly lost Humanity when their characters felt justified in doing something wicked.  "Hey," I'd say. "Does Jimmy feel remorse about what he just did?" "Fuck no!" someone would say, and that would be that.  Or they'd say, "I think so...he might!" and the dice would tell us whether the character's dead heart maintained a wisp of recollection of human feeling, and we all eagerly waited to see the result. Saying Humanity is a punishment mechanic is like saying Hit Points are a punishment mechanic. It makes not one tiny bit of sense. Yeah, you lose some in particular situations, big whoop, you play D&amp;D, you're going to lose some hit points and if you Produce some Primetime Adventures, you're going to lose some Budget.<br><br>The Nature/Willpower thing was pretty lame, but not because people were too stingy with it, you could always just say 'hey, that was pretty Nature-ful, have a Willpower point' - it was because Willpower points weren't that great to start with. I agree it's much better now.<br><br>I think "getting out of the way" is a red herring. For some groups and campaigns, they would push mechanics out of the way (some of the 'how to play' essays suggested this as an option).  For other groups and campaigns they brought certain mechanics front and center (again, the 'how to play' sections suggested this as an option too.) I ran games where Humanity was pretty much ignored, intentionally, I ran games where Humanity was a bit of a seasoning to what was really going on, and I ran games where Humanity was front and center. The game system didn't hiccup, no matter which one I chose.  To describe this as a weakness of the system - that I can do what I want with it and change it easily - is loony in the head. The die pool system went wonky at the extremes but for the majority of situations it was adequate to the task, and was easy to customize and tweak.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite> A GM who's capable of filling in the rest, might as well just fill in the whole thing and not waste their money on a half finished design.</blockquote>\nSee, this is just weird to me. Sure, I can do homebrew settings, and in fact, all settings in play are homebrew, no two gaming groups ever play in the same setting, period, ever, but that doesn't mean that a game that gives me a lot of great material for my campaign is bad because I don't use all of it in a particular game. What if I am a crappy GM and I pass over something that would be gold for what I'm trying to do? What if I'm drunk when I'm reading the book and totally miss something great? Or what if I'm the greatest genius the world has ever known and the designer just happened to luck onto an idea that even my genius couldn't come up with? What if I've got sort of an outre' idea and I am homebrewing 3/4 of the setting but the game helps me with 1/4? Or what if I am enthused about a particular book and I use 99.99999999999999 percent of what's in there? Why does an individual GM's decision make a book good or bad? It seems to me that if a book is usable by huge numbers of players of a wide range of talent for a broad spectrum of possible applications, that's QED, a good book. And that is exactly what happened with Vampire.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145648">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145648/#Comment_145648" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T07:58:53+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  7:58AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've talked to many gamers who explicitly say that tricky mechanics and meta-gamey stuff does indeed break immersion, and is otherwise not fun.

If they wanted to do a game in a particular way, they'd mess a bit with difficulty numbers or throw in some extra character generation guidelines, and there you'd be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145675/#Comment_145675" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T09:49:19+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  9:49AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Marshall, that's exactly right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI learned long ago that when people say "I prefer X" that very much of the time what they really mean is "I'm familiar with X, X is normally the way I do it, I'm comfortable with X, and I can do X well".<br/>\n<br/>\nLikewise when they say "I don't like Y" that very much of the time what they really mean is "I'm not familiar with Y, I don't have much experience with it, I'm much more familiar with X, and I haven't been willing to spend enough time and effort to become as familiar with Y as I am with X".<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSo yes Jeffrey I am inclined to say that for the vast majority of people who will claim, vehemently defend and shout to the heavens that metagame mechanics break their immersion, that in reality the most frequent reason it breaks their immersion is because they never learned the techniques for effectively using metagame mechanics without breaking immersion. But it requires a willingness to develop new gaming skills which frequently means the "practice sessions" where those skills are being learned will be inferior in quality than if they just fell back on the skills they already have.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow if someone is unwilling to make that effort...well that's entirely up to them.  But then I can't abide them claiming that its the metagame that's breaking their immersion.  No, its their unwillingness to learn a new tool that's breaking their immersion.  Learn how to do it and you can metagame quite nicely without loss of immersion.  If you don't want to, fine...but then put the responsibility for that choice where it belongs.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think the number of people who honestly truly CAN'T immerse and have a meta awareness at the same time are extremely rare...far far fewer than who actually claim that's the case.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that said...there are as many different approaches to incorporating the meta level into the game as there are games.  Some are friendlier to immersion than others.  Some click with certain people better than others, and so on.  So I'm not saying that there's no such thing as an immersion intrusive mechanic.  I AM saying that the meta level of play is not automatically intrusive simply by its mere existance.  So I am saying that dismissing all metalevel possibilities in a design because one believes that all meta level possibilities are automatically intrusive is designing based on a false assumption.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145678/#Comment_145678" name="Item_69" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T10:02:10+00:00" title="May 23, 2008 10:02AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">What I'm trying to get at with my assertion is the whole thing, from page 1 to The End, whatever may happen to be between those covers.

If you're designing a "no-metagame" game because you believe that metagame mechanics break immersion, not fantastic.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully that's more clear.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145717/#Comment_145717" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T12:34:14+00:00" title="May 23, 2008 12:34PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            JD,<br><br>Thanks for sharing your experiences playing Vampire.

These people are real.  I've touched some of them.  If your theory requires that they be *deluded*, then so much the worse for your theory.<br>\n<br>\nI will speak for myself.  I *love* Dogs and its ilk.  I think they are profoundly cool games.  However, they can't be all things to all people.  By choosing to have strongly Author stance dice mechanics, they preclude certain styles of IC play.  To shut your eyes to that tradeoff seems utterly foolish to me.<br>\n<br>\nThere is an area in design space that I believe is not sufficiently served.  Namely, to apply modern "tight-focused" design techniques to games with strongly IC, concrete, non-metagamey resolution systems.  Nobilis and Amber are on the edge of this space.  I'm working in this area now.  I believe there are people who will be better served (e.g. have more fun) from a system of this sort than stuff like what Vincent and Ben (who are both undeniable geniuses) are putting out.<br>\n<br>\nI believe I am one of these people.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145733">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145733/#Comment_145733" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T13:11:59+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  1:11PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know what you're disagreeing with Jeffrey, as there's nothing you wrote in this post that I disagree with, or that contradicts anything I've said.<br/>\n<br/>\nRalph                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145741">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim" title="Jeffrey Straszheim"><img alt="Jeffrey Straszheim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeffrey%20Straszheim">Jeffrey Straszheim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145741/#Comment_145741" name="Item_82" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T13:33:18+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  1:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fine.

No sir it was not a punishment mechanic. People gleefully, eagerly lost Humanity when their characters felt justified in doing something wicked.  "Hey," I'd say. "Does Jimmy feel remorse about what he just did?" "Fuck no!" someone would say, and that would be that.  Or they'd say, "I think so...he might!" and the dice would tell us whether the character's dead heart maintained a wisp of recollection of human feeling, and we all eagerly waited to see the result. Saying Humanity is a punishment mechanic is like saying Hit Points are a punishment mechanic. It makes not one tiny bit of sense. Yeah, you lose some in particular situations, big whoop, you play D&amp;D, you're going to lose some hit points and if you Produce some Primetime Adventures, you're going to lose some Budget.</blockquote>\nWell, by that analogy, then yeah... Hit Points kinda are a punishment mechanic. Some differences, though: Hit Points come back real easily, Humanity doesn't. The game makes it pretty hard to regain Humanity. Also, low HP doesn't limit character effectiveness. Your Humanity rating limits your dice pools during the day. So when the hunters break into the vampire's haven at high noon, the callous badass gets punished, the goody-two-shoes doesn't. Humanity also became a Difficulty rating for certain rare circumstances I can only vaguely remember.<br><br>In my experience playing and running Vampire, Humanity was a list of stuff the player couldn't do, without getting punished. It turned into unwanted book-keeping. Same with the Paths of Enlightenment. When I ran a Sabbat game for my friends, they loved being badass! They wanted to kill Camarilla vampires, blow up buildings and set stuff on fire into the wee hours of the morning. But picking a Path was just hassle. They would look through the lower depths of each and just choose the one with the sins they were least interested in doing, so they would avoid losing points.<br><br>Nothing in Humanity or the Paths actually provided <b>incentive</b> - nothing <b>drove play forward</b> - except the expository text. And the problem there is that not all players actually read the books...<br><br>Now, if the punishment was for evil stuff across the board, without having to memorize/look up a list, and you just wrote a philosophy for your character that allowed you to do the bad stuff without being punished - I think that would be a rule that actively drives play forward, and functions equally well for players who have and have not read the books with all their expository text.<br><br><br>So your players were masochists - I can understand, I feel the same way about Sanity in Call of Cthulhu. I love that downward spiral! But did they still think it was cool when low Humanity came back to bite them on the ass? Did that even happen in your game? Cause if it didn't, that may be an example of your game getting "screwed-up" when you start fiddling with the rules (&lt;-- hyperbole, of course - you had fun with it - but consider the point, at least).                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145785/#Comment_145785" name="Item_89" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T17:15:01+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  5:15PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2008 5:16PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>So your players were masochists - I can understand, I feel the same way about Sanity in Call of Cthulhu.

If the dice said they didn't feel genuine remorse, then, Aristotle-style, the game requires that they gain that genuine remorse by acting remorseful.  That drives play forward, bigtime.  If they didn't want to regain Humanity, that also drove play forward because now they had to deal with their degeneration, incrementally.<br/><br/>I still don't see why it's a "punishment" any more than, say, the Damage Track was a "punishment" mechanic for getting in combat, or the Blood Pool mechanic was a "punishment" mechanic for pumping your stats/using blood magic/etc. I just don't get what you mean by: "a list of things you couldn't do without being punished".  Is getting in combat something you can't do without (potentially) being punished by damage and perhaps death?

Who decides if you lose a point? The GM, decides how severe the sin is, based on the chart, and the player might not agree. If you don't roleplay remorse, you don't get to roll Conscience. So you take a hit based entirely on the GM's opinion of your roleplaying.<br/><br/>Hey, that's how I saw it. I maybe saw somebody get rewarded once or twice for roleplaying a remorseful character, sure, but my experience was almost entirely of seeing people resent Humanity as an intrusion. I felt the same way when I played. Nor did I ever really see anybody regaining Humanity. Generally, if roleplaying was going to drive it down, they weren't going to play a character that would get it back.<br/><br/>Damage comes from other characters, Blood Pool loss comes from player choice (or game time, as I also dissed above) - Humanity loss comes straight from the GM.<br/><br/><br/>Now, granted, I'm the kind of guy who wants to play a Sabbat game. If the choice is there, I will always, always choose Sabbat. So I will admit that might be a weakness in my argument against Humanity (I should point out I like the principle of Humanity, just not the implementation). But I saw the same problems with the Paths, and that's the basis of my criticism. Players think up a character, then groan when they have to pick a list of stuff they get punished for doing. And of course, Humanity's right out. So they look over the Paths and either pick one vaguely based on the premise, or based on which four worst sins they figure they won't do.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I just don't get what you mean by: "a list of things you couldn't do without being punished".</blockquote>\nSo, if I have Humanity 5, I can steal and that's okay. But if I kill somebody, I will lose a point of Humanity. And if I do something on the border, the GM interprets if I lose a point or not.<br/>If I get into a fight, I could still win. If I get into an argument, I could still win. If I use BP for stats, that's my choice. I can make a character that was good at any of those, if that's the game I want to play. But I never had a choice to play make a character who was good at being a badass until the Sabbat books, and I didn't really see much improvement.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>We had some low-Humanity games, but those games were so submerged in Vampire society that very little happened during the day and limiting the social dice was perfectly okay with everyone.</blockquote>\nRight, so if you remove most of the ill-effects of losing Humanity, it becomes like Hit Points - you're fine until you get to zero. It makes it easier to ignore the GM punishing you for your roleplaying.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145794">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145794/#Comment_145794" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T17:56:35+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  5:56PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i was going to let this alone for awhile, but i went away and it was niggling at my brain. so here's what i think about this stuff.  though... warning, mostly lately my experience is with the nWoD books, not the oWoD stuff... i can't recall exactly what the differences are between the various Morality traits.<br/><br/>soooo... the way i see it, these traits seem to represent what being a supernatural creatures is all about (at least to the game designers).  they seem to form the theoretical thematic core struggle of the creatures existence and what makes them, on an ethical or moral level, different from a human.  vampires have to deal with the fact they they are inhuman monsters.  werewolves have to deal with being half primal animal, half spirit.  mages have to deal with literally having the power to make just about anything they imagine reality.  etc.<br/><br/>yeah.  they're lists of "stuff you're not supposed to do."  and yeah, there are bad things that happen if you fall too far down that list.  but there is also something good that happens: you're more free.  if you're an evil fucking murdering bastard, you don't need to be concerned with your unpaid parking tickets.  that freedom comes with some kind of cost.  the other end of the coin is that there are good things you get out of being a saint, but you've got super-restricted behavior to keep those good things.<br/><br/>so that's why i don't really see it as punishment.  there's good things and bad things on both ends of the spectrum.<br/><br/>of course, your character is supposed to become an NPC and be taken out of your hands if he or she ever hits the big goose egg in the morality trait, so i suppose that could be seen as the ultimate punishment.  but seriously, the stuff you have to do to earn morality checks when you've got a 1 or 2 is pretty damn extreme so you've really got to be TRYING to be a monster.  you're not going to do that stuff accidentally.  and it's not like you didn't KNOW what would happen if you  hit 0.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145795/#Comment_145795" name="Item_93" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T17:58:38+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  5:58PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>Losing Humanity was entirely a matter of roleplaying.</blockquote>\nagain, maybe this is a problem of my only current memories of Vampire being from Requiem... but... the things that cause Humanity checks are actions.

A lot of people I played Vampire with were on the fence about playing vampires. If you are totally jazzed up to play a vampire, to struggle with your demons and backstab other vampires, you probably won't see many problems. But players who came to the table saying "a vampire, huh? I'll give it a try. What can I do that's cool?" And then the GM says "well, you can't do this, or this, or that other thing." And you end up with frustration.<br/><br/>On the other hand, players can't set up those parameters before playing - especially in nWoD. I can say I want a game with no combat, just politics. Fine. I can say I want a game with lots of vampires fighting each other. Fine. I can say I want a game with lots of research and buried tombs. Fine. But I can't say I want a game where my character can think he's supposed to lead humans into sin because he is a servant of the devil and not get mechanical penalties for it.<br/><br/>Well, I can if I use Paths of Enlightenment. And still, unless I bring a strong sense of motives to the game, I still only see stuff I can't do. Like how I can space out playing Burning Wheel and then look down at my Beliefs and go "oh right! I want to go do that right there." The mechanic doesn't push me into certain actions, not even ones the game provides! - it just pushes me away from certain actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145812/#Comment_145812" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T19:35:25+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  7:35PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2008 7:43PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>A lot of people I played Vampire with were on the fence about playing vampires.

If you come to the game with a sort of unformed "gee, what can I do in this situation" attitude, the game stumbles not just over Humanity but over a wholllle lot of things.  See my post above about our original dungeon crawls and my first college game where my friend made a character who had already "won Vampire".  Those were situations where I didn't have an explicit plan going in, where I didn't design a campaign with any goal in mind or work with players to make characters that fit into the campaign design - contrary to what the books suggested repeatedly, I might add.  Once I started doing conscious campaign design and give-and-take with the players at the beginning of the game, this problem never existed again. As you suggest, having players jazzed about how you are using Humanity (or not using it, or using Paths of Enlightenment, or whatever) solves this problem because they're ready to engage with the system and use it to move RP forward.  And that is exactly what the books tell you to do when cooking up a campaign and characters.<br/><br/>In this respect, Vampire taught me to be a better GM.<br/><br/>Edit: I should also note that there was a bit of interpretation in the Humanity rules that <i>I</i> always felt was clear but others did not (and I am not just talking about Internet morons here, I mean lots of people. I was always under the impression that you always believed a player when they reported their characters' feelings about an evil act they had done, but that the characters' feelings were not entirely their own.  The Beast was the true source of genuine feeling (scared of fire and sunlight, always hungry, always angry), the rest of a vampire's emotional existence was a sort of emotional muscle memory.  Thus when a player said "Joe does not feel remorseful", I took that as a given and Joe's Humanity degenerated. But when a player said "Joe DOES feel remorseful", I should then roll to see if this feeling was an actual memory of what it feels like to be remorseful or whether it was just a hollow, shallow impulse.  If the latter, that then was not the end of the story, instead it was the beginning. The dice have decreed that what your character is feeling is false and empty - now go and prove the dice wrong! That was an awesome challenge, in my book. It's a bit different than just a generalized Humanity gain. It was clearly making up for the action that caused the degeneration.<br/><br/>Others did not see that and only used the much harder general Humanity gain rules, which I agree are much less satisfying if you're trying to drive play forward (as the advice suggested you should.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145815/#Comment_145815" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T20:46:09+00:00" title="May 23, 2008  8:46PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw it happen whether the GM had a plan or not, and it happened even when players set up situations with the GM for their characters to struggle with in the game.

On the other hand, if you're interested in playing a monster, you're still perfectly free to commit the murder.  There are choices and their are consequences TO those choices.<br/><br/>I'm not sure I believe that in a WoD game it SHOULD be possible to just decide your vampire is going to lead people to sin without any ramifications.  It sounds like deciding that your vampire is a servant of the devil is going to make him or her less Humane.  It still makes sense to me...  the vampire is acting like a monster so the Humanity mechanics will enforce that monstrosity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_145825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145825/#Comment_145825" name="Item_98" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-23T22:49:41+00:00" title="May 23, 2008 10:49PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: fnord3125</cite>I'm not sure I understand this concept.  how can you "shut down" a choice?</blockquote>\nI mean the game doesn't provide the player with any specific options that are positive. The only specific options it provides are what you get penalized for. Playing a callous vampire isn't a risk like getting into a fight is a risk - you get penalized immediately. So if you're trying to sell somebody on playing vampire, all you have to show them are specific instances where they get penalized. By "shut down" I suppose I really mean "discourage" 'cause it just makes it a bitch to play, it doesn't actually stop you from playing. Unless it puts you at 0 Humanity, when it actually does stop you from playing. Because it negatively reinforces morality, it pisses people off.<br/><br/>I really don't know what else I can say on this topic. Remember, I'm not saying it doesn't work for everybody, just for some people.

I was about to say that it does give you positive options (Be good!  Don't murder people!) and it does give rewards for being good.  I believe (at least in nWoD, again) once you hit 8, 9, or 10 Humanity there are increasing bonuses you get.<br/>But... you're talking about the fact that the main way Humanity works and the way it is described in the book is by a long list of stuff that causes your Humanity to drop at various levels?  "Do this it goes down, do THAT it goes down..."  but it never says "Do this and it goes UP!"

Now this was primarily an issue in the old World of Darkness.  After the Requiem reboot, there's been explicit support all over the place for different sorts of supernaturals to team up, and the newly unified mechanics mean that it's as balanced as you can reasonably expect it to be. But back in the day, there was this giant urge to put different supernatural sorts into the same game, either as antagonists or protagonists. I found this to be problematic because, as I noted above, they all had niches, and White Wolf was very good at making the niches relate but not really overlap. In other words, my Vampire character and your Werewolf character wouldn't really hang out and do things together even if there wasn't inherent hatred, because the Vampire character is blind to the spirit world the Werewolf character thinks is the center of things and the Werewolf character is at about the fourth grade level of deception and betrayal whereas the Vampire character, even if they're not any good at it, at least have a college degree in the fields just from being in the world Vampires live in.  There just wasn't much in common there to build a campaign from even if you wanted to. <br/><br/>Oddly, one of the books that addressed this most directly, Dirty Secrets of the Black Hand, was reviled by most players and even later developers. I thought it was quite good for what it did - it created a global creepy/occult problem, and positted a cross-species conspiracy working to address the problem.  It showed how emphasis on tone (gothic + Hellraiser) and careful planning of what everyone brings to the table can overcome the "we have nothing in common" issue.

If the rules called for even something as simple as "write down the one person your character cares about and would do good things for on your sheet" that probably would have made a big difference.

But I get where you're coming from.  And I too think a game where PCs work from Humanity 1 up would be pretty fascinating.  However, the big question during set-up/chargen would be: how did the vampire fall so far?  and why, after falling so far, would he or she decide to start trying to be good again?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_145908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/netwomble" title="netwomble"><img alt="netwomble" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.google.com/netwomble/R5fup6Cz6tI/AAAAAAAABIQ/mSl7x0gzHo0/s144/Womble_logo_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/netwomble">netwomble</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/145908/#Comment_145908" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-24T23:57:55+00:00" title="May 24, 2008 11:57PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnstone</cite>Colin's right on it.

Then afterwards I will show you how I NOW use it.<br/><br/>I generated a quick R-Map of a fictional game to help with this example:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.gliffy.com/pubdoc/1435425/L.jpg"/><br/><br/>This is a really simple game setup, for a game with only modest political content. Why? Because there is only one central power struggle and - most important - it only has two players, McNulty and Glossop.<br/><br/>Another thing you can see is that this city is of significant importance to Vampire society. These are pretty powerful vampires. However, there is a lot of mobility and involvement of Kindred of lesser power, so this may be the very pinnacle of Kindred power in the city. (There's even a character right in the middle there, Bauer. who could be a stand-in for the PCs, a 10th Generation Brujah is very easy to make with normal character creation.)<br/><br/>The two power players each have one group or person completely in their pocket. (Bauer and the Brood).  They each also have someone that they have a bit of a shaky relationship with - Glossop knows her relationship with Josef is shaky, but McNulty doesn't know Burton is not completely in his pocket, giving Glossop a bit of an edge in "seeing the board".  However, McNulty has the edge insofar as in the current setup, he's still got Burton playing on his own side (not to mention his Brood would almost certainly be underestimated by any of Glossop's plans).<br/><br/>What relationships are stable and which ones are tenuous?  McNulty/Brood is stable. McNulty/Glossop is stable.  Glossop/Bauer is stable.  Josef/Burton is stable.  Burton/Bauer is stable.  That's it.  McNulty/Burton is tenuous because Burton is looking for a way to get out from under McNulty's thumb.  McNulty/Josef is tenuous because McNulty hasn't exerted the full measure of control over Josef.  Glossop/Josef is tenuous because circumstances require they both focus elsewhere for the moment.<br/><br/>Of the stable, positive, relationships, Burton/Bauer is the weak link, they're only business associates, if they could get more elsewhere, they would.<br/><br/>This quick analysis gives you a sense of how things are, a snapshot, and you can see a lot of things already developing out of this simple, bipolar setup.  You should always have three poles of power if you want to have an intrigue game, but for this example, I'm keeping it simple.<br/><br/>This is pretty straightforward.

It's actually fairly stable.  You can play an entire game without that R-Map changing.  And that's how I approached it based on what I saw in Vampire supplements like Chicago by Night. The R-Map is what it is. The things that created these R-Maps are spread over decades of Kindred existence and there is not much that is going to happen in the scope of a game to affect it.   (That was never in the text, but neither did it say that these relationships would change, so that's how I thought of it at the time.)<br/><br/>So even with that restriction, what did I do with these R-Maps? Here are some examples:<br/><br/>* The McGuffin<br/><br/>Plenty of Vampire plots involved some magical McGuffin which someone wanted or did not want others to have. This is cool because it gives PCs something concrete to seek, destroy, distribute, use, etc. However, because of the way the line got started, a LOT of these plots were fucking lame. I believe the phrase I used on Usenet was: "If the Vampire plot you are in involves the acquisition of a 'magic item', RUN, do not walk."  There were a few exceptions, naturally. The Tremere had to be involved in magical stuff or they were sort of pointless, for example.<br/><br/>Anyway, let's say there's a McGuffin that is going to be the focus of our game.  For whatever reason, the PCs acquire it and give it to Glossop.  Who knows or can reasonably guess Glossop has it? Follow relationships that involve exchange of information.  Bauer and Josef.  Josef, as a Tremere, would be highly interested and may even have more information on the McGuffin than Glossop herself.  I decide what Bauer and Josef think of Glossop having the McGuffin: Bauer is okay with it, Josef opposes it.  Josef and Burton discuss the matter (their Iron Alliance allows them to trust each other, and Burton might be able to confirm Josef's information via Bauer) and together they hatch a plan to get it from Glossop.  The R-Map has given me the questions I need to answer to get to the next step in what happens.<br/><br/>Now, that's how I did it at the time. I looked at each character, worked my way back to the person who had the McGuffin, and (separately from the map) figured out what they would know and what they would think about it, and (back on the map) who they trusted to achieve what they wanted.<br/><br/>These days I handle it a little differently because I'm okay with the R-Map changing, and in fact I want it to change over the course of the campaign.  So I built this little rules extension (OH NOES TEH GAEM IS BROKAN) Basically I look at each character of interest and I say "All right, <i>how bad</i> do they want this thing?" There are 6 characters (the Brood is indistinguishable at this point), so I assign them a number from 1-6. Normally I would do this by looking at each character and thinking about their history, goals they think the McGuffin might help them achieve, desire to keep it out of the hands of others, etc. For this example, let's just randomly assign them in reverse alphabetical order:                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146441/#Comment_146441" name="Item_115" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-28T11:13:57+00:00" title="May 28, 2008 11:13AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            McNulty: 1 - Doesn't much care about the McGuffin, sees it neither as a threat nor as an asset<br/>Josef: 2 - Interested but not willing to sacrifice much to get the McGuffin, or expend too many resources, but wouldn't kick it out of bed for eating crackers<br/>Glossop: 3 - Wants the McGuffin, considers it more of a potential threat or asset than an actual one, and its acquisition/control as a marathon rather than a race<br/>Burton: 4 - Wants the McGuffin, considers it an actual threat or asset, is concerned it not fall into hostile hands, will fight to get the McGuffin as a result<br/>Brood: 5 - Very much wants the McGuffin, considers it a high priority, an immediate danger if in hostile hands, and will expend significant resources to get it<br/>Bauer: 6 - Desperately desires the McGuffin, it is a top priority, everything else within reason takes second place to its immediate acquisition<br/><br/>And any time there is a conflict between two characters connected to the McGuffin (info about it, its location, the names of agents/PCs working on getting it, etc), I look at the chart to see who wants it more. If the numbers are different by 2 or more, the higher number gets what they want.  If the higher number belongs to a less powerful or controlled Kindred, they are hurt by getting what they want - they expend resources (minions, Influence, Status, even their own Health if they have to beat it out of someone) to overcome the higher power of the character that doesn't care.  Doing so might change the relationship.<br/><br/>Example: The Brood loves their boss McNulty but he really doesn't give a crap about this magic McGuffin. He has some information a minion gave him about its whereabouts and they want it.  They want it a LOT more than he wants to keep it from them (5 vs. 1). But he controls them, not the other way around. So they get it from him in return for him extracting a massive service from them, perhaps changing their relationship so that the Brood is more ground under his heel and they are not as confident in his abilities.<br/><br/>Example: Josef wants the actual McGuffin far less than Burton wants it.  It falls into Josef's hands, perhaps because as a Tremere he might have the resources to analyze it properly.  Burton finds out and demands it from Josef.  Josef doesn't care as much as Burton, but they're approximately equal in power level and there's no control relationship there, so there's not a significant shift in their relationship and Josef turns over the McGuffin.<br/><br/>Basically, an R-Map in this situation is a simulator for the behind-the-curtain mechanisms of the social world of the Kindred, and its main advantage is emergent - a very simple situation, like the one I posit above, can produce a lot of surprising outcomes, surprising for all the players, including the GM.

That is, if nothing happens, the situation is going to continue as it is, it's not going to tip over from anyone's actions. Virtually all the R-maps given (and implied, when they were not explicitly prepared) are like this. That can hold you back if all you're looking at is the R-map and trying to figure out what sort of plot to introduce. It should be done the other way around. A plot should be introduced and then applied to the "static" R-map, which is then a tool for figuring out consequences, like rolling dice in the skill system is a way of figuring out consequences at that granularity level.  <br/><br/>If you are more open to the R-map changing, as I eventually became (and as I think certain aspects of Vampire suggest they should), then you start to focus on different things on the map...but I'll get to that in a bit.<br/><br/>First let's talk about PCs on this map.<br/><br/>Now, the "default" for Vampire is a group of characters who have a common interest, usually from different clans and usually with different specialties. This is a natural "party" for Vampire due to the ridiculous amount of backstabbing in Kindred society and the crappy position of most PC-level Vampires. That said, they don't stay together and not all of their interests are necessarily contiguous.<br/><br/>The first and easiest way to use the R-map, both as a player and as a GM, is to leave the PCs off the map entirely. To some degree this is supported not just by Vampire but by a huge amount of "team of specialists" fiction and other games.  They are considered plot elements like McGuffins and events outside the control of the characters on the map, and identifying, evaluating, and responding to their actions are the same as they might to, say, the FBI showing up in town to shine flashlights on exsanguinated corpses.  This is how I started out using PCs. This has the advantage of being quick and easy and you can just make a list of PC actions that need to be responded to along with other game circumstances and just go down the list. The disadvantage is that again, this is a static thing and if the PCs want to affect the situation they are beating their heads against this document behind the GM's screen.  (Or a document they themselves can see.)<br/><br/>The second and somewhat harder way to use the R-map, though certainly different, is to spread the PCs out around the outside of the R-map relatively evenly, say, if we had 4 PCs, one would be up above McNulty, another below Glossop, another to the left of Burton and another to the right of the Brood, far enough out that we could get lines from the NPCs to the PCs. All lines go outwards - how the PCs respond to the NPCs is entirely the work of the players.  The advantage of this method is that the emergent properties of who-knows-what and who-does-what can now include the PCs to their (and other NPCs') surprise.  The disadvantage is, first of all, it's fucking unwieldy if, like with my group, you had one PC who was really interested in going around and cultivating a relationship with everyone, others who were interested in one NPC and not many others, and some who were pretty disinterested in the whole politics thing altogether, and did their best to stay separate and not get involved in anything other than the tasks at hand.  Basically this mean that only one player was getting any benefit from the R-map and everything else was filtered through them. Not ideal. But if you have a group where everyone is interested at similar levels, this is a good way to handle it.<br/><br/>Next: Changing the R-map, how I came to the conclusion that they should change and what Vampire told you about changing them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146601">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146601/#Comment_146601" name="Item_119" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-29T02:47:51+00:00" title="May 29, 2008  2:47AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff, Jason.

Nothing told me differently and there were some bits of text that told me they should, though I had never really given them much thought before.<br/><br/>I did it sort of haphazardly until I started becoming a DVD commentary track junkie. One of the things I heard from several different actors and writers stuck with me: never say, "that character wouldn't do X". Eventually you have defined yourself into a corner, the character will never do anything.  Instead, decide what you want the character to do and say "under what circumstances would the character do X".  By contrast to 'wouldn't do', this is freeing, it opens up possibilities instead of closing them off. Taking this insight back to the Vampire relationship map, here's what I came up with:<br/><br/>1 - Pick a relationship on the map (both ways, if it has two directions).<br/>2 - Under what circumstances would that relationship change to what I want it to be?<br/>3 - What would those circumstances do to other relationships on the R-map?<br/><br/>Example:<br/><br/>I want the Brood to break away from McNulty, to hate him ineffectually while he disregards them. I look at the relationship and figure, "He would have to gain some permanent, lasting advantage in some area to offset that this collection of vampires would go from being his willing servants to outcasts".  The permanent, lasting advantage might be, say, hooks in one of Glossop's trusted underlings (not necessarily on the map) who could tell him Glossop's plans and next move. Perhaps by framing the Brood for something this underling did he could obtain blackmail material, and everyone would trust that he wouldn't accuse his own Brood without the evidence being overwhelming? Yes, that works nicely.<br/><br/>What's interesting about changing the R-map in this way is that, in contrast to the above analysis method, it's plot-generative, rather than plot-reactive. You work backwards from your target to how to aim at it.<br/><br/>And thus concludes Uncle JD's lesson on Vampire R-maps, little Billy.

I understand that you're able to apply the same principles to PC actions, but my question is, the NPC-stuff you describe, how would you actually work that into the game? Like, would PCs be on hand to witness it, or would they hear about it later, or would the changes just happen, and the PCs maybe never hear about the cause of the change at all? Like, for example, the Brood pursuing the McGuffin and promising McNulty a favor-would the favor directly impact the PCs (like, negatively, possibly violently), and if they talk to the Brood about it, they'll be like, "we had to! It was the only way our Lord Mcnulty would give us the info!" ("Oh? The info on what exactly?" "Aieee! we've said too much! Skreeee!") Or would it be just something there, in the background, that would <i>maaaaybe</i> come to light if just the right person asked just the right questions? Or what? I'm just hazy on how use of the map would actually look in play.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_148571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148571/#Comment_148571" name="Item_129" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T07:44:24+00:00" title="June  6, 2008  7:44AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In the original, no-PC-on-the-map method, it is quite possible to generate outcomes with the maps that are distant from the PCs and have no immediate impact, you got it. It's a social outcome simulator, nothing more. However, in practice, if you use the simulator on plot elements the PCs are involved with, it's very rare that there will be an outcome that won't affect them in some way ("The Brood's got the info we need, how the hell did they get ahead of us?!"), often directly (Bauer: "God damn you, PCs, for doing what you did, god damn youuuuuuu...")  You shouldn't just throw random things at the R-Map, you should throw things that you and the players worked out in your campaign design as being what the campaign is about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_148609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/148609/#Comment_148609" name="Item_130" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-06T12:00:04+00:00" title="June  6, 2008 12:00PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            OK, I think I get the picture.

And it's got a lot of different answers that go a long way past Vampire, to every extent of the GM-runs-the-world milieu.<br/><br/>Sometimes something happens and nobody ever knows but the GM. Hell, a lot of times this happens with facts in mystery games that just aren't uncovered by the PCs. Have you ever finished a Call of Cthulhu scenario and still had some player handouts behind the screen? Sure you have. <br/><br/>There's not always an intention associated with it - sometimes the players just don't go where you have a detail generated, aren't as interested in uncovering the details as you were in simulating/generating them, or decide that the thrust of what they're after is in a whole different direction. If, say, on this R-map, I throw:<br/><br/>* The fallout of a Masquerade violation committed by Bauer.<br/>* A magical dingus.<br/>and * The Sabbat is in town targetting assholes who wear black tennis shoes and talk on their cellphones in movie theaters.<br/><br/>I'll quite easily get a lot of plot developments that just won't ever hit the "screen" because of <i>time</i>, let alone anything else.<br/><br/>The benefit that these offscreen details have is, in a way, prophylactic.  The players (GM included here) feel the world is real, because if they keep pushing in a direction, they'll find more details, every development has an in-world reason for it, and you never kick over a cardboard cutout standing in the background of your game.  They might not see every single detail you generate, but it's more than just an inner smile of satisfaction nobody else gets to share (and it's at least that, in a lot of cases), you're preparing for many player options.<br/><br/>There are ways the players find out about these background things, though:<br/><br/>"Cutscenes" in which players take on the roles of NPCs experiencing the events of the change. (Vampire suggested these in, I believe, the Revised Edition Storyteller's Guide, so fairly late in the process - but in First Edition, they suggested troupe play, which included multiple point-of-view characters for each player.)<br/><br/>A post-game recap (mentioned above, particularly a good practice for our LARP where far too many details were being generated in each session for any one person ever to figure out what was happening without a recap)<br/><br/>GMs can push their favorite details into the fiction in various ways. Vampire never suggests this, though I've experienced it before, and Dogs in the Vineyard's GM advice put it into text for the first time (for me), with the stuff about just having NPCs come up and lay it out for the players and figure out why later.<br/><br/>There's probably a lot more ways to look at this....<br/><br/><a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2814" rel="nofollow">Here's an old thread</a> with some good discussion of worldbuilding and what it benefits even when players don't experience every corner in any given campaign of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG" title="Albi_SG"><img alt="Albi_SG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Albi_SG">Albi_SG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289044/#Comment_289044" name="Item_132" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T18:11:47+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  6:11PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, tell me if it's  inappropriate to summon back such an old topic, but... wow.<br/><br/>Recently, i posted a thread asking for some D&amp;D-style, but lighter, story-oriented games to play with friends.

Now, for a practical question: how did you combine different characters, located in different points of the R-Maps, and still get to do something like a common game, instead of different solo adventures sparsely intersecting? i guess, the trick might lie in a clever use of the McGuffin, or whatever thing you set in motion (i had already thought of the r-map as fundamentally static, and was thinking i need something to get any kinf of action up and running... in particular, i was thinking about opening the game with some NPC getting killed, creating an imbalance in the city politics...), but can you share some experience you had or some insight about it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289052/#Comment_289052" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T19:31:59+00:00" title="August 26, 2010  7:31PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Where's the personal horror?

The whole notion that your vampire's emotions might just be the musty old memories of what it was like to be human, and that the Beast that ACTUALLY runs your life doesn't give a shit whether you feel bad about anything, ever...not a bad seed for a personal horror campaign.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289075/#Comment_289075" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T23:12:15+00:00" title="August 26, 2010 11:12PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know, I read the posts about Humanity and how to implement it, but all of the AP stuff I got from Jason relived my own experiences running a long term small scale LARP, city politics.

The characters (remember, the player characters were often not on the R-Maps, or are scattered around outside for shorthand purposes and to remind me who they want to stab) were going to be part of a coterie. In some games I said "You are all vampires that are 50 years old or less, and therefore if you're not working together, some asshole is going to pick you off for no reason and tell everyone you deserved it, and nobody will take revenge for you." and that was the connection, I let them work out the relationship details.  (Now that I know more about PC relationships being so important, I might come up with more solid detail creation work there.) Other times I gave the coterie a purpose. "You're the Prince's chief cooks and bottlewashers, when shit gets done in his name, it's usually you." That gave them an investment in a single purpose. But normally if I had to pick a purpose it would be a common enemy that they couldn't hope to prevail against alone. I found that really motivated the group.<br/><br/>Vampire did have the problem of being "5 games of Vampire" if you have 5 characters that are created without communication or consultation or a clear campaign idea.  There is not much reason to invest in each other's success at individual goals in the game, in fact the clear social underpinning of Vampire society is the graceful "fuck you, got mine". So when you do campaign design, be sure you have a clear picture of the sorts of things you want them to do or be.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>I'm not saying that Vampire didn't do that well, I think it did, but I noticed, Jason, that you never mentioned this as an aspect of your play (unless you mentioned it).</blockquote>\nYeah, it was the Humanity thing, here's what I discovered in the Humanity rules (I don't know if this is what I am supposed to find or not): losing Humanity is a <i>strong motivation to seek to make amends</i>.  In other words, it's much easier to regain Humanity and stave off your dissolution by specifically making up for the shit you did than it is by just generally being a good person.  That means when you're a GM, you have to constantly think about the consequences of someone's action, really trace it out, because if they come back and say, "I want to make up for it", you want to have a detailed situation that they can see their own cold dead hand in.<br/><br/>The main method of personal horror in Vampire is this:<br/><br/><i>Acting inhumanely, i.e. murdering people for political gain, is the fastest and most effective way to achieve your goals. </i>  Doing things nicely and diplomatically is less likely to work and virtually impossible to make stick against people who are willing to act more inhumanely than you. I don't know if this is ever explicitly stated, but I think it's implicit in the rules and setting.  <br/><br/>Vampire really suffers if you let an outbreak of Reasonable NPC Disease develop, or even too many "cold and calculating" NPCs who will rationally tote up their best interest and never send a bunch of assholes with gasoline cans to set fire to your house.  Actually this was a great strength of the citybooks.  Even in the worst of them, there was always some fuckhead ready to go over the edge because you didn't sufficiently praise their begonias.<br/><br/>Glad the thread was of assistance!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289079/#Comment_289079" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-26T23:24:08+00:00" title="August 26, 2010 11:24PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2010 11:26PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hm.  Y'know, I personally never really used Vampire to do a horror game -- some personal "what horrible things would you do to get what you want?" moments would come up, but the Vampire games I played in never made horror (personal or otherwise) the center of everything.  I'm not sure why that is, exactly.  I mean, the game's capable of doing horror, but for some reason when we would sit down and set up a Vampire game, we never wanted to make horror the centerpiece of it.<br/><br/>Now, Wraith is a different story...ALL of our Wraith games were horror games.  And, oh, at least 3/4 of our Changeling games.  For some reason, those two lines <i>really</i> clicked with our group as perfect setups for a horror game, to the point where we couldn't really conceive of a campaign concept that didn't involve it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289098">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289098/#Comment_289098" name="Item_138" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T01:16:05+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  1:16AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think when people complain that Vampire didn't deliver on its expectations, they mean on the horror front. Horror is so there... but its hard to do a horror game and do some of things specifically touted in the books (I'm thinking of some of the undead bad=ass ex-CIA type character templates from the Clan Books, sorry I can't think of any specifically). I am now seriously tempted to do a Vampire Hack that focuses on horror and tries to parse down all the other stuff. You know, Vampire could almost be reworked around a sort of old school D&amp;D model, where when you "level up" you do functionally different things: Phase 1) Horror, Phase 2) Grunts/Yesman run around and have mystic adventures, Phase 3) Political Intrigue, Phase 4) Horror again as you start to become something really alien.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_289101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289101/#Comment_289101" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T02:35:09+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  2:35AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 27, 2010 2:38AM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wouldn't say so much that it didn't deliver on the horror front -- I mean, it definitely had its feet firmly planted in a particular brand of horror (the Anne Rice variety, specifically, which...well, YMMV on whether that counts as "horror" to you).<br/><br/><br/>I've been thinking about this over the past little while, trying to work out why whenever we picked up our Vampire books, we never said "Okay, let's do a horror game!"  And I can't speak for the other people in my gaming group, but for my part, I think that on some level I looked at the tools in the box and thought, "Ah ha, there is a hierarchy here, with lots of different organizations and lots of different goals, and some very pragmatic rules that everyone more or less must adhere to.  That looks like fun!"  And oh yeah, there's this personal horror angle, too, but that doesn't seem to be nearly as cool or as fraught with interesting play opportunities.<br/><br/>But then there's Wraith, and that produced almost exactly the opposite reaction in me.  I read Wraith and thought, "Look at all the fantastic, horrifying ghost stories you can tell with this!  Everything that a ghost cares about is personal!" and shrugged my shoulders at Stygian politics, immediately classifying it as being less interesting and less relevant and clearly Not What The Game Was About.<br/><br/>And Changeling, where again, my first reaction upon reading the books was "Holy shit, these guys are SO SCREWED.  What a terrible place they're in, look at all the horrors that surround them, imagine all the stories you can do with that," but didn't connect much at all with Court politics.<br/><br/>But why?  Why did my brain look at three toolboxes which are more-or-less equivalent and say "Vampire games are about politics and intrigue, Wraith and Changeling games are about horror"?<br/><br/>My preliminary conclusion so far is that I think I see wraiths and changelings as <i>victims</i>: something was done to them against their will, and now they have to deal with the aftermath of that.  Their lives were derailed and they've been thrust into a bad situation and it's not their fault.  But vampires are <i>victimizers</i>: yes, something was done to them, but now in order to survive they have to do pretty much the same thing to other people, forever.  So while a wraith or a changeling could feel bad about their lot and the stories of how they deal with that could go lots of different directions, a vampire doesn't get that luxury:  you have to grow some pragmatism FAST when your continued existence requires you to drink the blood of the living.  Bemoaning your curse of undeath starts to ring a bit hollow when you're actively hunting down new people to assault.<br/><br/>So maybe that's why whenever I picked up Vampire, my mind grabbed at the Realpolitik and the philosophy and the grasping, needy hunger in all things that (to me) epitomized vampiric existence, and scoffed at the "personal horror."  I didn't want to get personal with those guys.  The kind of personal stories that I could think of for a vampire seemed to be either tediously depressing, or hypocritical mopery.<br/><br/>Today I can think of some other options for how to do a campaign focused on personal horror in Vampire, but...when I think about it honestly, I would <i>still</i> prefer to put my main focus on how vampires deal with each other, and keep how vampires deal with themselves as a minor part of the game.  It's just how I'm wired, I guess.<br/><br/><br/>Oh, and...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>Phase 1) Horror, Phase 2) Grunts/Yesman run around and have mystic adventures, Phase 3) Political Intrigue, Phase 4) Horror again as you start to become something really alien.</blockquote>...this is cool!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_289120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/289120/#Comment_289120" name="Item_140" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-27T07:01:18+00:00" title="August 27, 2010  7:01AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I think the newest Vampire is best for horror gaming because it's very crossover-positive, and if your group of bloodsuckers is targeted by a monster from beyond the void, it's what you call "good fun" instead of "ruining the mood".<br/><br/>But really, it's just about as much horror as Anne Rice is horror, and you can debate that as much as you want but you won't hear it from me.
