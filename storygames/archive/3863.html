As a term of art, I will use the word "acratic" to mean, literally, "without judgement", and we'll use it to describe play groups that are not interested in the theory and discussion of games but rather are looking for fun and cheetos only.  I think these players are essential and I think the distinction is also essential but every plain English word I came up with had some negative overtone that I certainly do not want.  So "acratic" is what they are throughout.<br/><br/>My other note is that I'm going to get hardcore pretentious here.<br/><br/>Okay, I think we screwed up. <br/><br/>For a while now there's been a division in the role-playing game community -- maybe for a long while -- and in an effort to illuminate the distinction that creates the division, there have been a lot of name changes.  We've seen "Indie games", "Story Games", "Fiction Games", and others.  None of them seem to quite fit and when we read the criticism from the traditional gaming community it is often along the lines that these new game forms are "too cerebral", "not fun", and, occasionally and I will now argue more insightfully, "not games".   That's right, I think our noun is broken. <br/><br/>Hang on, hang on.  Let me finish. <br/><br/>I think there are two important things here: what we're doing and what we think we're doing, and what we're doing is about a million times more interesting.  We are very highly focused on what we think we're doing, though, and I think that has blinkered us to the possibilities of modern gaming.  What we think we're doing is making new games that better emulate certain forms of fiction.  I have long argued that role-playing games are essentially unrelated to fiction in any useful sense and I stand by that.  I see, however, a reconciliation.  These are not games.  We are not trying to make new games that better emulate certain forms of fiction.  We have everything ass backwards and when you set it up in the right order it all suddenly makes sense. <br/><br/>What we have is a new form of literary criticism.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86647/#Comment_86647" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T13:38:39+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  1:38PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's look at what the best examples of our games do.  They isolate a critical element of a particular kind of fiction (maybe a kind that the author has invented, but usually not) and develop a mechanism by which a group of largely uninformed creative amateurs can reliably create new fiction in the genre.  Okay that sounds like we're making games that emulate fiction, right?  Well we are, but the game is not necessarily where the interesting bit.  What's interesting is that we have created a scientific approach to literary criticism. <br/><br/>Consider: a game author has a favourite form of fiction (Vietnam movies of a certain type, superhero comic books, issue-based science fiction, and so on -- you know the drill).  He isolates the components of that fiction that make it recognizable as a genre.  He mechanises those components -- he creates an algorithm by which people with limited creative input can generate or fail to generate these stories.  We have a hypothesis, an experiment, and a laboratory.  That's right, the game itself is the least important part of the process -- something I think many game designers secretly believ in their hearts.  After all, when you're finished designing an awesome game, is your instinct to play this awesome game forever with your friends or is it to construct a new game? <br/><br/>What is happening here, culturally, is that our algorithmic tools are finally catching up to the field of literary criticism.  We now have a broad base of people trained in or at least enthusiastic about fiction, drama, and language arts in general who also have had sufficient exposure to algorithmic thought (thanks to the pervasiveness of computer usage) to bring it to bear on their topic of interest.  When they see a genre of fiction and wonder what makes it tick, their toolset includes (and may now be dominated by) the capacity to mechanise process through well defined algorithms and, though these are expressed as game mechanics, I think something more general is happening. <br/><br/>These mechanisms -- the alrgorithms -- are essentially hypotheses about how a given genre works.  If you can supply certain constrained inputs to the algorithm you should reliably get genre-correct fiction out the other end.  And it seems to me that the games we laud the most are those in which this is most successful.  We can even see a scale of success that relies on the quality of these algorithms -- the degree to which they express the hypothesis as well as the quality of the hypothesis as a description of how the genre functions -- and that scale is how well the game works with an acratic play group.  We all know that most games can work when the game designer is at the table with some enthusiasts (I mean really, Josh, playtesting Shock with Vince Baker and Ben Lehman?  What were you thinking?) but the acid test is when the game is released to the public and acratic players are tasked with cranking out genre fiction.  If it works then we have evidence of the quality of the algorithms to express a true hypothesis. <br/><br/>So what are these games, then, if not games?  These are the laboratories of our endeavour.  This is where the hypothesis is tested.  It is of ongoing interest in much the same way that a chemistry set is of ongoing interest, but once the job is done and the lesson learned it's not so interesting any more and that's why we see problems of durability with many of these games.  They are not intended to provide continuous ongoing entertainment (though they migh!  Many laboratories are great fun and some more than others -- a good observatory could keep me enthusiastically occupied pretty much forever) but rather to prove a point and exercise the skill of translating that point into a proof machine.  These games are machines that prove things about literature.  The game table is the laboratory.  These are not games, and hence our naming problem. <br/><br/>So there are a few criteria by which we can judge a game's quality.  Normally we would have something like:<br/><br/>- Is it fun? and,<br/><br/>- Is it clever?<br/><br/>This second is where we get accused of wanking and, if 1. is genuinely our primary goal, then with good reason.<br/><br/>What I propose, however, is something like:<br/><br/>- Is it fun?  Now fun is not very hard to achieve -- Yhatzee is fun.  Just rolling dice is kind of fun.  Doing somersaults on the lawn is fun.  Fun while being interesting is much harder.  Personally, I think that's a great goal but interesting is sufficient precisely because fun is so easy.  Interesting is, however, way to vague.  So:<br/><br/>- Do the rules of the game test the hypothesis?  That is, are the game mechanisms well designed to explore the questions about stories that this game asks?  That is, does the laboratory work?<br/><br/>- Does game play deliver a result?  When the game is played by acratic players, do we get the fiction we anticipate?  Do we not?  That is, what are the experimental results and do they tell us anything about stories?  How does play differ with non-acratic (cratic is probably more correct but it's my word dammit) players?  What can we conclude?  That is, does the experiment work?<br/><br/>- Is the hypothesis about fiction interesting?  Is there something in here that someone who made a career out of literary criticism would be excited about?<br/><br/>I think we have some games that really solidly deliver on all four of these points and more as well, but they are written as though they are games, which defeats them.  The details of the experiment are invisible because it is written as instructions for the lab animals to follow.  For modern games to really deliver, they need to get really explicit about what's happening -- maybe that's a supplement or some other ancillary text or maybe it's right there in the book, but I'd sure like to buy it all at once or right next door.  That is, with a copy of, say, Shock: in my hands I want to also see:<br/><br/>- What the author thinks about the target fiction is interesting and how the mechanisms of the game get at that essence.  Clearly the author has thought about this and is doing something really intentional.  I want to read about that.  Building the mechanism allows him to test minimum assertions about genre, for example, and whether they are sufficient, necessary, or irrelevant to genre by whether or not play with those mechanisms delivers the genre.<br/><br/>- What the results of the experiment are with non-acratic players.  How did play go specifically with respect to proving the hypothesis about the source fiction.  Note that I don't ask about fun because it will be indivisible from academic interest for most non-acratic players.<br/><br/>- What the results of the experiment are with acratic players.  Do people with no interest in the underlying goal deliver the goods and prove the hypothesis?  Is the result interesting in other ways?  Do they have fun doing it?<br/><br/>- What do we conclude about the fiction?<br/><br/>See this is why I think we have things ass backwards.  Playing these games is fun, interesting, inspirational, and exciting, but I don't think that's what's essentially interesting about the games.  What's really interesting -- maybe ground breaking -- is how they are tools to examine fiction.  Not "might be", mind you, but "are" because they are certainly exploring the boundaries of genres, media, and other aspects of fiction whether or not anyone is taking notes.  The fact that they are games is like getting excited about a new kind of wrench -- I mean new tools are cool, but what's exciting from an enduring perspective is that you can fix the sink faster, better, and (or) cheaper.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86654">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86654/#Comment_86654" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T13:54:44+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  1:54PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            See, I think you're right about everything here except for this thin candy shell of supposed ass-backwardness. <br/><br/>Replace "what we think is cool about all this is totally lame, and ___ is cool instead" with "___ is also cool about this" and you have a real insight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86655/#Comment_86655" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T13:55:38+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  1:55PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, interesting stuff and all, but ... \n<blockquote>That's right, the game itself is the least important part of the process -- something I think many game designers secretly believ in their hearts.</blockquote>\nRight there you lost me.

I am not even saying that game designers don't design games in order to play them.  I am saying that the game itself might not be as important as the process of examining the fiction, elaborating a hypothesis as an algorithm, deploying the algorihtm as a game/experiment, and making conclusions about the literature (or the experiment) as a result.  That is, I think that the whole system is extremely interesting and possibly important and that many game designers appear to suspect this, judging by their designs.<br/><br/>My thesis there (not a theory) is one relating to the (potential, possible?) importance of what's going on.  My guess as to what game designers of games that are clearly doing this (deliberately or not) think is important is pure speculation and doesn't weigh on the thesis at all.  Your position is a data point that's interesting (though I'm more interested in whether as a designer you think this other stuff is important <i>at all</i>, leaving aside any relative importance) but I don't know if it generalises.<br/><br/>Does the stigmatisation of academic interest in games and game design affect anyones design or discussion of their design?  That interests me a great deal too because there are plenty of critics and players that are extremely hostile to any efforts to consider games "important".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86667">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86667/#Comment_86667" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T14:18:45+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  2:18PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 2:19PM by Brad_J_Murray.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>See, I think you're right about everything here except for this thin candy shell of supposed ass-backwardness.<br/><br/>Replace "what we think is cool about all this is totally lame, and ___ is cool instead" with "___ is also cool about this" and you have a real insight.</blockquote>\nYeah looking back on that it's probably just hyperbolic for effect.

It rewards things that actually do seem to define the type of fiction that the game seeks to emulate.  I think, however, that it's only useful in an academic sense if the whole system is considered -- by which I mean the process from deconstructing the fiction to find the elements that need encoding, through the encoding as algorithm, play, and review of play results.  It's possible that many designers are not doing this because they are not going through any formal process while designing a game, but they are doing it anyway, and it would be awesome to see the system laid bare.

This is true in the general sense, not just for RPGs.<br/><br/>Many of today's MMO's, for example, are particularly un-fun. most peoples' fun originates from overcoming the un-fun bits. Contrast with RPGs - we have fun whether we slay the dragon or not. MMORPG players don't have fun being killed by the dragon, their resolve to overcome the challenge the dragon represents increase as they respawn. Eventually, the fun comes out of overcoming the un-fun challenge.<br/><br/>"Fun" is very tricky to nail down in the general case. Every time I've seen the issue pop up on various game design forums ('specially MMOs) it's come down to a penis size contest that eventually peters out (pun intended) into oblivion, entirely unresolved. So you can't really define something a "game" because it's "fun". There is a more precise definition of a game, which I'm sure someone will add to this conversation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86690/#Comment_86690" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T14:44:24+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  2:44PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I doubt the existence of "acratic" players.  Perhaps they're <em>consciously</em> acratic in that they don't specifically think about thinking about stories, but they still get enjoyment out of the mulching and reforming of stories in the culture.  There's this episode of Stargate, right, where there's a Sword in the Stone situation, and nobody can pull the sword until the absolute crisis point, and then the <em>girl</em> pulls the sword out of desperation.  You don't have to be a conscious consumer of media to get a visceral thrill out of that; you only have to be female.  All people respond to stories, whether or not they consciously think about their responses.<br/><br/>And art always comments on other art.  Art is an ongoing dialogue of a culture talking to itself, articulating what it believes.  I don't see why game design should be any different.  Shock: is a piece that talks about the future and comments on other pieces of art from the speculative fiction genre.  Even the most uninnovating fantasy heartbreaker is participating in the conversation about our legends and myths and what makes people human or good or whatever.  And it does this whether or not the players are aware of it, and the players enjoy the experience <em>because</em> the game is participating in the dialogue, and because the players, playing the game, are participating in the dialouge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/misuba" title="misuba"><img alt="misuba" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gibberish.com/gifs/misuba_cartoon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/misuba">misuba</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86691/#Comment_86691" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T14:45:12+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  2:45PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 8, 2007 2:46PM by misuba.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Halfjack</cite>what I want is for there to be some room for games that are fascinating but not fun.

You could probably find similar stuff in the earliest days of any artistic medium. "Story games as literary-criticism laboratories" is a valuable idea in and of itself, but it's kind of a funny place to end up as a mere response to the problem of why we consume entertainments that aren't Entertainment. How about just that they're engaging and stick with us after they're over? You know, the same as in film and TV and books and whatever?<br/><br/>[cross-posted with everyone.

More stuff jumped out at me, much of which might be tangential again:<br/><br/>* I think you're absolutely right that there are game designers who treat their games as ways to explore certain elements of story. That's their approach and guiding principle, and the success of those games rides on how well they deliver on that exploration. Probably some are more Socratic than others -- that is, there's not really exploration so much as indoctrination via illusory choices and a narrow range of "correct" answers.<br/><br/>* That said, as I dip my toes deeper into the hippie end of the pool I'm really struck by how much GAME is in many of these supposed "story" games. Intricate interlocking economies, novel randomizers, tactical decisions, strategic decisions in some cases, risk/reward analysis, even explicit win conditions imposed by the designer on the players. (NB: games with win conditions are perhaps the <i>most</i> Socratic of the new skool, because they're telling you exactly where you're going to end up, and every in-game event exists only to end up there.) Fist-pumping "story now!" cries aside, there's a fuckload of math+psychology packed into a lot of these games that may or may not have anything to do with achieving story, plot, immersion, or exploration. (Hot-button concepts, all.)<br/><br/>* Thesis: The activities that make games pleasurable are unrelated to the activities that make lit crit analysis pleasurable. However, it is probably a valid design goal, if one so chose, to attempt to merge those goals in synergistic ways. How do you tie risk analysis into examination of story? How do you tie the examination of story into tactical decision-making?<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86750/#Comment_86750" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T16:50:42+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  4:50PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>What if I find examining fiction to be fun?

(because lit theory has focused on the trees of a few pieces of the canon rather than the forest of how literature has evolved). The parallel is that we don't need yet another book analyzing a Bronte novel-  several game reports on My Life with Master and Wuthering heights roleplay would generate much more data.  <br/><br/>3. I don't necessarily buy your overall argument because story games could just as easily be compared to literary games or writing machines as to literary criticism: slightly more complex versions of surrealist or oulipo writing games, or how about a manifesto for how to write a piece of fiction. Maybe the writing of a story game draws in criticism because the designer is implicitly excluding and including and prioritizing - judging-  aspects of their source material; but the play of the games is more like following a herky jerky formula for writing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

After an academic career focused on literary theory, I came to the conclusion (and maintain it to this day) that Literary Theory is largely the infected carbuncle on the ass of literature.<br/><br/>I realize that's not the most diplomatic way of expressing it and I apologize if the reader feels differently and is offended. <br/><br/>Literary theory is nearly completely tangential to anything having to do with ideas about the creation of stories and literature. Instead, it is a body of theory on the <i>interpretation</i> of literature. It has become a field of obscure academics pushing obscure ideological arguments purportedly based on interpretation of texts but divorced from both the intent of the author and even from the text itself (I'm looking at you, Derrida and de Man!).<br/><br/>I'll grant you that some of the techniques used in designing games are similar to techniques used by literary theorists and critics. But the resemblance is a passing one.  We are not operating at the remove (parasitic remove, in my view!) at which they operate. We are not interpreting existing stories, except inasmuch as we are exploring existing stories in search of principles (like Egri's premise!) that we can use to create a set of procedures that others can use to generate their own stories.<br/><br/>I should note that Lajos Egri was not a literary theorist. He couldn't be one, because his ideas were about creation, not interpretation.<br/><br/>All that said, I think the place where we do intersect with a school of literary theory is in the realm of reader-response theory. The stories we create are fascinating under the light of reader-response theory because the creators are also the audience, but the audience still has elements of the experiential discovery characteristic of traditional readers or viewers.<br/><br/>Anyway, the long and short of it is this: I don't feel that we are creating games for the interpretation of literature. On the contrary, I think we're doing something far more fascinating: We are creating tools for the creation of a new type of media in which certain limitations and constraints are set by a person or persons who would, in a traditional view, be considered the creators, and then passed to a new set of individuals who shape an experience out of those limitations and constraints.<br/><br/>A certain subset of those games (though certainly not all!) are focused on creating their limitations and constraints in such a way that the resulting experience has a distinctly literary narrative shape.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86789">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86789/#Comment_86789" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T19:22:55+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  7:22PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well put, Thor - all of it (including the carbuncle comment).<br/><br/>Of course, many literary theoriticians and for that matter many postmodern authors certainly <i>act</i> as if they're playing a game.

I'm not trying to shut it down so much as express my own view. The line between literary criticism and literary theory is a very narrow one, and extremely blurry when you get close to it. The techniques of literary criticism are largely derived from literary theory. I take the view (and I'm not alone) that literary criticism is the "practical" application of literary theory. Literary theory is the theory of how to interpret. Literary criticism is the body of work using that theory to interpret.<br/><br/>(I know, I hate irony quotes too. And yet I used them!

If you don't mind, I'll try to relate to it via explanation, and you can tell me if I'm missing what you're saying.<br/><br/>When Matt and I were working on Panty Explosion (and later, Classroom Deathmatch) it was definetly with the goal of producing an engine to create certain kinds of stories. We recognized that there was a real audience for horror and/or comedy stories about Japanese schoolgirls. We also knew that there were a lot of people who just wouldn't care or wouldn't know how to approach that genre. So we tried to create a "game" that in following it's guidelines and rules would give participants that kind of story. The idea being that it doesn't matter what you put into Panty Explosion; what you get out of it is Japanese schoolgirl genre stories (nevermind that we mashed 2 or 3 distinct genre together). This seems to be the case whether you approach the game as a reluctant player or as an enthusiastic genre fan.  Classroom Deathmatch does the same thing with a much more narrow focus (instead of a whole genre, we chose to focus on a specific novel).<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>This was all kind of accidental. We wanted a game that "did" Japanese schoolgirl horror (we later drafted comedy onto that). We knew that left to their own devices, most players would approach the game in the same way they would approach D&amp;D (or whatever their point of context was. Maybe Vampire, Dogs or How to Host a Murder). So we made a game that forces players to take a certain approach and results in a certain kind of story.  This was kind of an accident of neccessity, or maybe a self fulfilling goal. We created an engine for creating a certain type of genre fiction because we needed a way to make sure our game would be played the way we wanted it to be played. The goal became the point of the whole thing.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>What I'm getting at is that for me the "game" <span style="text-decoration: underline;">is</span> the creation of the fiction and the commentary on the genre. Maybe "game" is the wrong word then. But that's definetly the point of the whole exercise. When I ask "do you want to play some Panty Explosion?" what I'm really asking is "do you want to explore the Japanese schoolgirl genre of fiction and the inherant politics, relationships and fetishes that go with it by creating some really neat fiction together?". For me, that's the point of the entire engine. Rolling dice, keeping track of stats and even playing the role of a character are all just means to that end. <br/><br/>Am I missing your point?<br/><br/>Jake                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86866/#Comment_86866" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T05:09:39+00:00" title="August  9, 2007  5:09AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2007 5:13AM by timfire.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A problem I have with this idea is that it <i>feels</i> like "what designers do" is being conflated.

Change the name of "Spotlight" &amp; "Fan Mail" to "Attention level" &amp; "Social Feedback", and (like <i>The Pool</i> or <i>Universalis</i>) you get a ruleset that primarily discusses who-can-say-what-and-when, devoid of rules that directly effect content.

Regarding the construction of Panty Explosion, I'm delighted to here that the attempt to capture genre was deliberate even if you feel the result was a little accidental.  I expect that it was more a result of iteration (evolution?) and therefore accidental, perhaps, but certainly not random.<br/><br/>Timfire, when I was first dreaming up this hogwash on the bus (I don't really think it's hogwash, but I want to defuse a little of its pretension because literary critcism has become, with good reason, highly unfashionable), Universalis came to mind immediately as something I'd want to fit under the umbrella.  So this brings up three things for me.<br/><br/>First, I don't think game designers are necessarily doing this.  I think they have stumbled on a tool that could be part of the process I've described.  That is, some game designers could be doing this and some literary theorists could be doing this.  I think there would be a net benefit to our understanding of literature if it were so.  I imply nothing global -- I don't think all games pursue this, I don't think all games should, and I don't think that the most fun games necessarily do.  I just think there's a tool in here somewhere even if it's fun to play with.<br/><br/>Second, Universalis obviously doesn't address genre, which is what I focus my essay on.  It might, however, be an experimental lever to dig at something else about fiction.  In fact, it does try really hard to be a machine that generates compelling stories without respect to genre, which I think probably also merits some scrutiny.  But I agree it's certainly a different kind of beast than the specific tool I describe.<br/><br/>Now, reading over Jake's post a couple more times, I wonder how much player buy-in (and familarity) is necessary for the genre to be re-created.  If it's assumed that the players have to be well versed in the genre before genre fiction can be cranked out by the game-machine, then the game wouldn't be sufficient to examine fiction in that way with any precision.  I guess I'm wondering if it's possible to create games that can great genre fiction without the players supplying the genre components consciously or otherwise.  That is, this might only be interesting if the genre is cranked out largely through the mechanism and you're both suggesting that that might never be the case.  Could be!<br/><br/>I guess the place to look would be fictional genres -- games that reliably build fiction for a genre that the author of the game has invented.  I don't know if those exist -- Polaris seems closest, but even it has touchstones.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86978/#Comment_86978" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T10:47:46+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 10:47AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've arrived just in time. <br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, let me say that I'm largely in Thor's camp, with largely the same biases. Indeed Derrida would probably saying that our dismissal of literary criticism here is actually indicative of a social modus wherin we're trying to dissociate ourselves from a perception that the movement is, indeed, overly cerebral or, perhaps, elitist. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo which I can only reply, "Uh, whatever."<br/>\n<br/>\nPut whatever motives you want on it, I really don't care. Do you enjoy playing Universalis? That is, in point of fact, the only thing that I care about. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTo discuss how it was created, the game largely created itself. Which is to say that after the fact we decostructed what we'd done to come up with an explanation for why it works. And one of the things we discovered was that what Universalis largely does is to inform players that conflict is important in creating action that's meaningful in some way to the players. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, you can say that this is a literary deconstruction. If it is, it's a very simple one, and, again, the game was created this way unconsciously. I mean, far from being visionary on this, Raph and I figured we needed a resolution system in the game that included conflict, because, well, all RPGs have em. Now, what's interesting is that Universalis can be run entirely without the conflict mechanics - you can play a very similar game where everyone just makes up stuff paying coins for it one for one, including any potential conflict outcomes that come along. So, in fact, it may well be that we were just subject to the same sort of traditionalism that causes most RPGs to have separate combat systems. <br/>\n<br/>\nIt's only after the fact that we figured out why the game is better with the Complications rules in them than without. And that's because people find the suspense of the resolution of a conflict to be entertaining, and enabling in that it gives things to sorta "play around." Without which play is relatively dull. <br/>\n<br/>\nIs that a literary criticism of some sort? I thought it was more of a psychology idea. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nIn any case, I agree with Tim on a lot of things, but, even if Universalis is called "The Game of Unlimited Stories" as a subtitle, I'd argue that RPGs really have very little to do with anything that can be labeled "Story" or "literature." In point of fact, in working on our new game Other World, I've been striving with Mark (in a mail I just sent out, in fact), to stop him from using the term "story" in the text. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhy? Because I think that equating what we do in RPGs with stories is dangerous. It causes expectations that are rarely met, and, in fact, should not be met in my opinion. If you want a story, read a book, or even go see a film. <br/>\n<br/>\nWhat do RPGs do, then, if not provide stories? I subscribe to the Chris Lehrich school of thought here that what is created - if we must name it with a term other than RPG Play - is akin to the myths that are created by societies that have actual living myths. I'm not going to get into it too much here, but it should suffice to say that this has to do with the players transmitting values to each other. If it were that alone, it would be similar to literature. But there's something else. RPG play also includes the immediate feedback of the listener. Much like a shaman in some pre-industrial society telling his story in improvisational manner to his audience of members of his culture, the idea is that you relate the events, then see the feedback of the other participants, and then make up more stuff modified according to the reward system present. If the audience likes X, you'll probably give them more of X, for instance. <br/>\n<br/>\nBooks, Movies, stories in general, are all mono-directional formats, where the author simply conveys meaning to the audience. Even in a play, the performer does not alter his performance given the feedback he gets from the crowd in terms of the meaning conveyed. Even in improvisational theatre, I'd argue, does this happen, because the feedback from the audience is very subtle, and the feedback from the other participants is only in terms of their actual contributions. In a RPG, you have these secondary systems for rewards. Like EXP in D&amp;D, says to the player, "Good job for kicking ass!" Further "table talk" (even if verboten in certain groups) is actually a common form of feedback. Heck, just the fact that you're sitting around a table or something, so that you can see the reactions of the people closely as you're describing the action, is unique and important. You don't get that in a dark theatre, or even when acting and not facing each other. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is, why, in fact, that LARP is really more like improv theatre than TT RPGs. But it does have it's reward systems, however. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn all of these cases, however, even if you say, "Mike, that sounds a lot like literature to me in how you're talking about value transmission," one fact remains that's incontrovertible. The players are not deconstructing the genre, unless that's the value that they want to pass along. That is, sure, if you have some deconstructionists playing the game, the play can be about deconstruction. Heck, you could even make up a game about deconstruction (see the Iron Game Chef winner named Court of Nine Chambers). But the goal of play is the transmission of those values. <br/>\n<br/>\nWe are there to judge each other. Make no mistake. "Good Play" is when we "entertain" each other. The words "Fun" and "entertainment" are dangerous, in that they are almost always locally defined. I have loads of fun playing World of Warcraft, even if somebody else calls that non-fun. I actually do have fun deconstructing things at times (rare). I have fun doing math problems. That's just me, and I don't suppose that all of these things are going to be "fun" for anyone else. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut there's a Turing test for what fun is that we all understand. We know it when we see it. I'm not saying that people can't be having "fun" in deconstructing in RPG play. All I'm saying is that the play is about establishing these deconstruction values, then, between the players. Not in deconstructing deconstruction, for instance. And since most play isn't about deconstruction, it's about construction of understanding of meaning and values between players. <br/>\n<br/>\nYes, I think that value transmission has a great potential for fun. Which is not to say that it's somehow objectively better than Yahtzee's form of fun. But it's a form of fun that one can only get from RPG play. Yahtzee certainly won't allow you to do face to face value transmission with feedback cycles, will it? So, yeah, there's something "heavier" going on here, if you will. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut it's construction, not deconstruction. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and I don't want to be, again, accused of some kneejerk reaction in protecting the "commoner" player, but as somebody pointed out above, all players are the same on this. Everybody who plays RPGs is creating meaning. Even the most gamist "beer and pretzels" RPG game play does this. Yeah, it may not be as "heavy" in tone or as "deep" in terms of meaning transmitted. But even if the meaning is just "Look how cool these characters can be when we level them up" that's all about some values. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe "dichotomy" between "us" and "them" is entirely "them" being reactionary to new things. No, I don't expect every player in the world to want to discuss meaning on the level of, say, Polaris. If they had said, "that game is just not my cup of tea" I'd not quibble. But if they say that Polaris is at the same level of "cerebrality" as, say, InSpectres, I'd laugh in their face. <br/>\n<br/>\nPolaris and D&amp;D are precisely the same activity at their root. The only difference in people's opinions of these games are in terms of content (making their like or dislike no different than if they like Rifts and dislike Paranioa), or them making some BS political statement. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_87004">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/87004/#Comment_87004" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-09T11:53:25+00:00" title="August  9, 2007 11:53AM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 9, 2007 12:03PM by timfire.">edited August 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Mike Holmes</cite><br/>I'd argue that RPGs really have very little to do with anything that can be labeled "Story" or "literature"... Why? Because I think that equating what we do in RPGs with stories is dangerous. It causes expectations that are rarely met, and, in fact, should not be met in my opinion. If you want a story, read a book, or even go see a film.</blockquote>\n<i>(I... can't... resist...)</i><br/><br/>[rant] OK, this is the thing I've been ranting about lately, because as I said earlier, I just wrote an article about it. RPGs are about "story", but <i>improvisational</i> story. Improvisation, as compared with "composition", has certain characteristics. Or rather, applying improvisation to the creative process has certain consequences. Composition allows for editing, so you get nice and tightly formatted output. In improvisation, you can't edit, so things are much more stream-of-consciousness.<br/><br/>Compare Jazz, for example, with other forms of compositional music. If you can, compare compositional-jazz with improvisational-jazz. With that in mind, if you compare literature/whatever with RPGs, you see a similar distinction. I believe alot of confusion is caused because players try to impose compositional-standards on improvisational-RPG-play (and to this end, Mike's comment about expectations is true). So RPGs are still about "story", but a <i>type</i> or <i>quality</i> of story we're not used to. <br/><br/>And while I'm at it, Jazz and the other forms of improvisational music I've participated in certainly contain the type of social feedback you get in RPGs. People in the audience will yell, "Yeah---that it! That's it!" <br/><br/>That's all a very simplified version of what I wrote for the article.

I think, however, that designing Polaris and designing D&amp;D were radically different things.  As a consequence of this difference I think that play resulting from these games might say different things to someone who was listening for it.  Like, possibly (or potentially), the designer.<br/><br/>Acratic play is the reason practically everyone plays and designs games.  That's awesome.  I'm just wondering if there's something else in there that can be done as well.  No amount of contemplation on these ideas (or even action upon them) will ever take acratic play away from anyone.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
