if you are looking into design it is important to understand the medium.<br/>All rpgs are "narrative based" ... the fundamental activity is to have a bunch of people around a table describing stuff to each other with the mediation of rules.<br/><br/>So you basically asked people "which is your favorite rpg?".<br/>Why don't you start instead by better defining which games you liked, and why?<br/><br/>Saying PbtA is a start but it embraces sooo many and sooo different games, it is almost like saying nothing.<br/>And different PbtA games often have less glamorous but still very substantial differences.<br/>So if you love Dungeon World you might still not like Monsterhearts; if you are into Tremulus you might not care for Monster of the Week, or you might have a thing for Sundered Lands and Murderous Ghosts which are still PbtA but are also pretty out there <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>Tell us about you.<br/>About your favorite games, and the why.<br/>And why are you interested in game design... do you have a project in mind?<br/>Stuff like that.<br/>This way people can offer you answers and suggestions that are more useful and to the point for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment"

With Dungeons and Dragons and Pathfinder but I had a pretty big disconnect with them. I wasn't sure why until I played my brothers game Worlds in Peril - which was my first foray into the Apocalypse. For me, this is how you tell a story. I like that it was a collaborative contribution to the fiction instead of purely just a reaction. But, to be fair, I think I also just didn't have a great GM for D&amp;D now as well as good ones seem to do lots of the MC stuff anyhow. <br/><br/>So far, I've pretty much only been able to connect with PbTA games for that reason, other games don't really feel like it's my story or world etc. I love Monster Hearts, Worlds in Peril, The Warren is incredible, and I really like "vanilla" AW. I do like Dungeon World, but the problem I've found after playing a lot more games - is that the setting just isn't that interesting compared to what else is up there. I want to play Nightwitches and Undying so bad...you've no idea. <br/><br/>I actually have a PbTA game on kickstarter up right now, which wouldn't be without the benefit of my brothers experience. He's published The Magicians and Worlds in Peril as mentioned. I wasn't finding what I wanted from cyberpunk in a PbTA game so ended up making it myself and when I was getting there my brother said it was really unique and interesting and I should try and kickstart it. I'm just very fortunate to have his experience and knowledge, or of course it would have never come close to being in the state it is now as well as funded. <br/><br/>The number one problem I have, I would say, is extremely weak writing skills. I hadn't written anything since high school...13 years ago? It's hard to articulate myself compared to other my learned people. Especially on here, so many amazing creators here.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452916">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452916/#Comment_452916" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-04T01:55:09+00:00" title="May  4, 2016  1:55AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gun to my head, I think it's got to be Fiasco.

I'm learning to avoid the much vaunted adventure paths, and go back to my old ways of brewing a fantasy yarn. I do willingly strip other fantasy games for part, though, like Dungeon World's Fronts.<br/><br/>Fantasy Craft is nice when I still want a d20 engine thingy a bit less focused on magic and shedding some of the D&amp;D baggage. My primary setting here is a far-future dark fantasy world I brewed up to the tune of Zothique.<br/><br/>Fate is my lego toolset for all sorts of gaming. Now that most of my group GETS aspects etc., we use it for all sorts of things. I used it for Space Opera, China-inspired fantasy, and for one shot fantasy, and a friend of mine is about to use it for Achtung Cthulhu (finally! I get to play instead of GMing). Fate accelerated is nice for pickups, and I've run Masters of Umdaar and Dugneons of Fate on such occasions.<br/><br/>Feng Shui 2 is a nice quick action game for one shots and off days.<br/><br/>Gumshoe is my go-to of late for investigative gaming.

What do you think?</blockquote>\nYes, it is point spend. And I don't want to sell it short, because I have had lots of great thrilling games with it, but I have seen the downside of the point-spend mechanic. I do think there is a certain art/skill to running good games with it.<br/><br/>To get it out of the way, I think the point spend mechanic works fine for investigative abilities.<br/><br/>For general abilities, I see two principal problems:<br/>1) It can create some weird situations that don't make a lot of sense.<br/>2) It puts a strategic decision making management pressure on the player that I think can lead to hesitation to act.<br/><br/>A few techniques that I have used and have seen used to get around the main problems:<br/>1) The "strategy pep talk for new players." Simply put, there are two main strategies to spending general ability pools:<br/>- Spend two points and roll (for general tasks)<br/>- Spend enough that you think you will succeed either on a 1+ or (if you think you need to conserve points and/or are willing to accept some risk) 2+.<br/><br/>Once new players internalize this, things go pretty smoothly.<br/><br/>2) As a GM, use and make players aware of the main methods of allowing players to refresh their point pools (resting, place of safety, vivid ability use narratives)<br/><br/>3) As a GM designing and running one-shots, start PCs with *many* more general build points than the starting total in the book for new PCs. To Pelgrane's credit, I have seen them doing this more with pregens in their newest adventure anthology for the Dracula Dossier, the Edom Files.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452982">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin" title="Colin"><img alt="Colin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin">Colin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452982/#Comment_452982" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-05T13:46:18+00:00" title="May  5, 2016  1:46PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, <b>Primetime Adventures, 2nd edition</b> endures for me.  While there are certainly games that drive to more focused experiences, I still love how PTA cuts to this quick of conflicts, and I've used it to play everything from a game about Chicago in the 20's with Fae, to Deadlands, to Superheroes, to a game about an acting troupe.  And I think it's a strength that it frees people to take on conflict outcomes that are as harsh or as light as the player is comfortable with, or is able to deal with that night.  Plus, it allows players to reward each other for good play, which is nice.<br/><br/>Though, honestly, my groups often play without a game system these days, just taking turns making statements in a conflict.  Or if we're not sure how things will go down in a conflict, or what would be the most interesting outcome, we'll draw a tarot card and allow that to guide us.  Simple, but it works tidily.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce" title="soyosauce"><img alt="soyosauce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce">soyosauce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452994/#Comment_452994" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-05T16:33:37+00:00" title="May  5, 2016  4:33PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can't say I'd heard of Primetime adventures, the shadows of yesterday, or land of Nodd.

If you try it, I would be interested to read some of your experiences.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Felan">@Felan</a> Out of preference.  I've played and like 3rd edition and I love some of the tools in it, such as the card-based show creation tool.  And the advice on how to play is, as always, wonderful.  The concept of impulses is interesting, and it may just be the case that the game we played in it just didn't pop, because the edition didn't settle with us, or we may have been taking the rules too literally in an attempt to learn the new edition.<br/><br/>However, the results of conflicts in 3rd edition can allow a character to both not achieve their goal, and "keep it together." Which feels a lot like nothing happening?  It came up enough for our table (possibly disproportionately) such that those plots just stalled at the end of those conflicts, with no interesting outcome or thrust to take this story forward.<br/><br/>By contrast, 2nd edition's analogous outcome let's you lose a conflict, but win narrative control, which gives you some latitude to either find a way around the conflict to get what you want another day, or you can narrate something unexpected and not part of this conflict that is either good or bad happening to your character.  So you might not get what you want, but something interesting should always happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453006/#Comment_453006" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-06T01:39:44+00:00" title="May  6, 2016  1:39AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really enjoying Chuubo's Wish Granting Engine these days.

As the game progresses, these plotlines reveal unexpected connections and converge to form a larger overall narrative. Stories told through the Land of Nodd tend to be twisted and mysterious, full of conspiracies and strange coincidences.<br/> <br/>Its design was inspired by novels and films like <i>Cryptonomicon</i>, <i>Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</i>, <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, or the fantasy novels of Steven Erikson. In a game of <i>Land of Nodd</i>, the main characters could never meet, affecting each other only at a distance, or even inhabit different places or different times. Their paths might intersect, cross and part once more, or converge unexpectedly at the climax of the tale, as in the films and novels mentioned above.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce" title="soyosauce"><img alt="soyosauce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/soyosauce">soyosauce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453058/#Comment_453058" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-08T05:43:48+00:00" title="May  8, 2016  5:43AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, Paul!

Tell me more.</blockquote>\nOK, I'll separate the setting from the system. <br/><br/>The setting is a sort of a pastoral post-apocalypse: some extra dimensional villains destroyed the world, and all that's left of existence is a piece of countryside with a big town, a small lakeside town, mountains, a boarding school, and a park... and outside the boundaries, reality just kind of fuzzes out.  Everything else isn't destroyed, but is sort of lost in a timeless chaos, so sometimes refugees float to the surface of the lake and are brought in to start their new lives.  Everything is a little old fashioned and fantastical, with a strong flavor of Hayao Miyazake's animated films, but different parts of the setting support different genres.  The guys who ended the world are still around and still scary.  <br/><br/>The system is complicated, and I'll link you to a lengthy detailed blog post about it that I've found very helpful: <a href="https://samhaine.wordpress.com/2016/04/04/chuubos-rules-summary/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://samhaine.wordpress.com/2016/04/04/chuubos-rules-summary/</a><br/><br/>In a nutshell, each character has certain things they're good at, which can be defined tightly or loosely: Tea Ceremony 2 or Enthusiasm 1, and bonds to people and places.  They can also have miraculous abilities, which range from mildly superhuman to godlike, which usually let them do certain well-defined things.  By spending will and invoking these stats, characters can form an Intention: the intention outcomes range on a chart from 0, "make things worse by trying to do the right thing" to 8, "absolutely the right thing."  This is probably unhelpful unless you've already played Nobilis, in which case you will notice that this is the exact same diceless way that PCs do things in Nobilis.  <br/><br/>The most interesting, and freeform aspect of the game, are the quests and arcs.  Your character starts with a specific quest as part of a character arc that suits their character type.  This gets really confusing with a lot of colorful prose, but basically it works like this: you are playing a character who is, roughly, a disgraced knight. (He could be a defrocked priest or rogue cop or whatever, it's purely a narrative thing.) You look in the book to find the disgraced knight arc, then take the first quest from it.  Maybe the first quest is to find a new teacher, and it gives you steps to doing that.  Each step earns you XP!  When you complete all the narrative steps, you unlock that part of your arc and can start the next, maybe where your character starts training with the new teacher.  There are usually extra XP to be gotten if you can contrive to make other things happen that are in theme, like entering a martial arts tournament under false pretenses. <br/><br/>Finally, there are other ways to get XP at the same time, most characters have a second side quest at least: besides finding a new teacher and reclaiming their lost honor, they are also working on making friends with their neighbors, for example.  <br/>And then you get a few XP for doing things which are in your chosen genre, like sitting by the river drinking tea with a friend in a pastoral game, or become obsessed with a mystery in a gothic game.  <br/><br/>So it's fun and complicated and twee all at the same time.  And as I said, I wonder sometimes if the whole system is just a way of incentivizing freeform play within a specific genre.  On the other hand, you really do get XP and you really do get more powerful over time, so I don't know.

Though I'm afraid it will sit there unused for a while, as my most likely prospective co-players aren't sold on playing minotaurs, or reading a setting book.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charles_Parkes" title="Charles_Parkes"><img alt="Charles_Parkes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charles_Parkes">Charles_Parkes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453304/#Comment_453304" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-15T09:06:18+00:00" title="May 15, 2016  9:06AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really enjoyed Teo Kuusela's \u2018Lords of Aswick\u2019<br/><br/>I loved the ability to grow old on a pile of gold, or get sent to fight the crusades after failed backing for a pretender to the throne.<br/><br/>I don't spose anyone else is a fan of Kuusela or 'Choice of' generally?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453305/#Comment_453305" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-15T10:06:11+00:00" title="May 15, 2016 10:06AM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, video games.

That game changed the way I understand roleplaying games, which is hard to do after having played traditional games for a decade and then "indie" games for another decade.<br/><br/>If we're also not counting games not availible in English, I'd probably go with ... Dream Askew? PbtA games aren't really my cup of tea, usually. AW is alright, and I've warmed up to it lately as I've played a longer run in it (it gets better after three or so sessions), but Dream Askew is like Apocalypse World done right. It keeps most of the good stuff about AW and gets rid of most of the bad stuff. PTA is also really amazing, though the conflict mechanic and fanmail system takes away from the brilliant setup and structure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

with people putting in their own games because that means that they make games they care about and are passionate about.<br/>I just want folks to note that, say "My favorite game is my own game, Time Pilot 2097" instead of "My favorite game is Time Pilot 2097". <br/><br/>Because every time I've seen someone talking about While the World Ends, it's been Wilhem. That's not been the case for Drakar &amp; Bananer or Svart av Kval. (Or Wilhelm's The Daughters of Verona, for that matter.)<br/><br/>Simon, you and Arvid and I were part of what I consider my very best gaming memory of all time, that O Coco band game that started out as an attempt to play Psychodrame but accidentally got good. So I hope you know that I bear no ill will against you and would love to play more games with you if you were to visit this mythic city again.<br/><br/>And Wilhelm, I know that The Daughters of Verona is beloved by many. Keep on making your good games. All I wanted to say is that it somehow, and I know this is a bit paradoxical / weird, makes me less interested in the games when I look them up and find out "Oh, he was promoting his own game" as happened the first time I checked out While the World Ends so many years ago.<br/><br/>I'm all about the Jante style, maybe too much. I didn't mean anything ill by it.

That's a new name for most of us here, I'd imagine!)</blockquote>\nGladly! Prosopop\xe9e is an amazing French game written by Fr\xe9d\xe9ric Sintes, availible from the Limbic Systems website: <a href="http://www.limbicsystemsjdr.com/boutique/prosopopee/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.limbicsystemsjdr.com/boutique/prosopopee/</a><br/><br/>If you know French, you should buy this game. If you don't know French, you should learn French, then buy this game.<br/><br/>The genre is surrealist fantasy. The players are painters who are painting a picture, and the picture is a world. They are using seven colors, one of which is Humans. After having painted the picture, they notice it is unbalanced, and the problem is related to the humans. In order to solve the problem, some of them incarnate themselves into the painting, becoming Mediums (PCs). One or two remain outside the painting and are called Nuances (GMs-ish). Together they attempt to find the source of the imbalance and correct it.<br/><br/>The game brilliantly uses rules for how players are allowed to talk to each other. For example, nothing in the world has a name, and you can never name a thing. And you can never interrupt a player who is talking, but must wait until they are done. This creates a wonderful, evocative, descriptive, slow rhythm in the game, which fits the surrealist genre to a T. The game is very hard to explain, but it's very different from other games I've played and changed a lot of how I think about RPGs.<br/><br/>Some examples of things I've played in it:<br/><br/>In a city resembling Venice, triangles are forbidden, since they are passages to the land of the dead. Recently, more and more spirits have begun to haunt the city. The strange companions end up travelling to the realm of the dead to find out why they are not reincarnating. They have become greedy and haughty, insisting that only a life as a human is woth living, and refuse to reincarnate as anything else. In the final scene, the three companions walk through the three triangles, one reincarnating as a tree, one as a raven and one as a human, thus leading the spirits by example.<br/><br/>Another painting is a world which is a ring inside a ring. In the inner ring, the king of steel and diesel is manufacturing hunger and desire with his terrible machines, guarded by flaming monkeys. A memorable phrase of the game: "The desire machine thus becomes aware of its own existence, and explodes from despair". sSmetimes in this game you realize you've said the weirdest things, but they always make sense in context, which is, in my mind, a sign of great surrealism. Another memorable phrase from a different game: "O, legless man who is riding a goat, throw us your beard so we can pull you ashore!". In context, it made perfect sense (for example, the man had given his legs to a poor girl who was sad because she couldn't dance), but out of context it's ridiculous.<br/><br/>In a game I facilitated at LinCon a few weeks ago, a man who had fish inside his eyes pulled out a squid, squeezed it to produce ink, and used the ink to teach the humans to write books and stories, so they wouldn't need to steal stories from other bubble-worlds.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_453590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453590/#Comment_453590" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-27T13:17:22+00:00" title="May 27, 2016  1:17PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's okay, phoenix182, I'm a bit of a grognard too.<br/><br/>In that vein, I'm going to throw <b>Gangbusters</b> out there, especially when played with a criminal campaign focus. It becomes a bit like Boardwalk Empire: The Game, with the focus on the business end of things. You're a petty criminal with big dreams. Get Rich or Die Tryin' in the prohibition era.<br/><br/>For sheer fun, a chopped back version of <b>Mythic GM Emulator </b>used as the engine for the more open form minis-using play I talk a lot about. The core resolution chart could use a lot of pruning back and modification, but the rest of it works a treat. It works especially well if you've come with a core idea and general situation, maybe a few things you as the creator of the set up would like to see in there (if the opportunity presents itself), and then a fairly laid back, go with it, make t up on the fly attitude in actual play.<br/><br/>There are bunches of other games I like, but those two don't get nearly as much love.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_453591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/453591/#Comment_453591" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-05-27T13:24:12+00:00" title="May 27, 2016  1:24PM">May 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played quite a bit of AW derivatives but In A Wicked Age is still my favorite.
