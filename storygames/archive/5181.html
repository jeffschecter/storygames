Please understand this is my first real undertaking at a full fledged RPG rule system.<br/><br/><a href="http://users.livejournal.com/_thiefofhearts_/10285.html#cutid1" rel="nofollow">You can find the basic rules here on my LJ.</a><br/><br/>One of the things came apparent in last night's playtest was that the Trigger voting system wasn't working well. Players have 4 tokens, one small positive vote, one large positive vote and the same for negative votes. Each player places one token in a cup when a "Trigger Song" is played by another player. <br/>The problem was that a player was more apt not to vote negatively, or at the very least, not use the big negative token.<br/>While it did cancel out a really poor music choice set to the action on hand, I couldn't help but feel that the system needs some serious tweaks. What changes to the voting system, without using dice if possible, do you feel should be made to remedy this issue?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116961">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116961/#Comment_116961" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-29T05:51:59+00:00" title="December 29, 2007  5:51AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any way to express the voting exclusively in degrees of positivity?  If you re-set the baseline so that stony silence (and no votes) was the worst possible failure state, that'd address half of your problem.  <br/><br/>Partially related - having "big" votes and "small" votes seems fiddly - why not have a curency pool players can allocate based on their own criteria.  If you have, say, four tokens, that's a big vote and a small vote, or two medium votes, or one huge vote, or a bunch of tiny votes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116975">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain" title="Wirebrain"><img alt="Wirebrain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wirebrain">Wirebrain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116975/#Comment_116975" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-29T07:52:30+00:00" title="December 29, 2007  7:52AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "no vote and all positives" was one of the routes I was considering. As well as having a vote token go away when you use it.<br/><br/>The problem I'm worried if I'm using them as a "circulating currency" comes back from when I GMed Deadlands, where people would horde their fate chips. Granted, I suppose that it might be unfounded because the tokens don't do the player any direct good or give him experience, Even if that's the case, I'd like it so players can not "save up" votes for the big fights at the end; changing the question they ask from "Was that trigger scene cool and entertaining?" to "Was that trigger even worth spending a vote?"<br/><br/>So what would be some ideas to bring more vote tokens into play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116976">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116976/#Comment_116976" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-29T07:59:18+00:00" title="December 29, 2007  7:59AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some people are never going to be negative about others' contributions no matter what you do and no matter how much they hate what others are doing.

PodCasters is a little different from those since as it stands now it forces a show of support (or lack thereof) under specific circumstances.<br/><br/>Also, the group we had for the PodCasters playtest had some of the very least blunt people we know. Now, I feel that I was being honest in how I voted, but I never once felt any urge to use the big negative vote.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
