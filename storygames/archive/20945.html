Sheets with a bunch of questions for people to answer have never really been helpful in my case. Unless you are doing it on a suffifient scale, and systematically enough, that you are getting real data points (and most RPG developers don't have the resources or expertise for that). So I advocate a more conversational approach after and during playtests. For an RPG one of the mosts critical questions I've found worth asking is "Did anything seem inconsistent". This is mainly for scenarios and setting but that can be hugely helpful at finding issues. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I'd say your best bet is to playtest, playtest, playtest and to run the thing in live ongoing campaigns. Without the latter, you risk creating a game that works great for one-shots but might have issues that only tend to come up over months of table time (and I can still guarantee you will miss things). <br/><br/>Also, take notes.

I think identifying just a handful of friends or colleagues who are great at finding mathematical problems, editing issues, or playtesting and reporting on that playtesting could save you a lot of time and trouble. Perhaps it's worth buying those people dinner or taking them out for a drink - or offering to do the same in return (read over and/or play their games) - in exchange for some small-scale but potentially really useful feedback. <br/><br/>Locate the people you trust to do a good job, and reach out to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_460133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan" title="AnonAdderlan (Banned)"><img alt="AnonAdderlan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AnonAdderlan">AnonAdderlan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/460133/#Comment_460133" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-02-11T15:36:41+00:00" title="February 11, 2017  3:36PM">February 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After more consideration I think the most important guideline it this: Focus on meeting the needs of a single target audience and then ask questions about how well your system met those.<br/><br/>For example, if you're targeting competitive players, ask questions like "Did system X give you the tools necessary to accurately assess the difficulty of your actions?".

It's obvious he wants things to be about the Nemesis, but it's also obvious he does not want things to be about how complicated the character sheets are.
