The GM also gets to familiarize themself with complex rules in advance, making them easier to initiate at the table and requiring less look-up and argument time.<br/><br/>GM prep sometimes results in multimedia and visual aids, such as detailed maps or soundtracks.<br/><br/>A preset plot can be convenient if your players happen to be tired or in a receptive mood, even for the most adamant "play to see what happens" advocates.<br/><br/>The feeling that a GM did a lot of prep to make a story thread just for you, tailored to your character and your play style, is charming.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344527/#Comment_344527" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T11:56:55+00:00" title="September 30, 2011 11:56AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The GM getting to <a href="http://www.lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=613#16134" rel="nofollow">love it when a plan comes together</a>.<br/><br/>The players getting to ride along with a skilled story-teller.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344529/#Comment_344529" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T11:59:17+00:00" title="September 30, 2011 11:59AM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2011 12:00PM by Felan.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My favourite DM is also my oldest friend, and he doesn't always do a lot of pre-determining, but on occasion he does, and it usually works out really well. The best example I can think of is a d20 Modern steampunk campaign he's running right now - it's a sequel to a campaign I played in a few years ago featuring some of the same characters, and so I made a cameo while visiting home as my old character. The party had travelled back in time in order to ensure that certain events happened as planned and did not disrupt the space-time continuum Back to the Future style. But the brilliant thing about it was that the whole adventure was based on a PREVIOUS adventure they had played almost ten sessions ago, so they had to make the past versions of their own characters do the things that they had already done. They had encountered my character as an NPC in the original adventure, but this time I got to play him myself, interacting with the time-travelling future versions of the party, later the same day. It was too fucking funny (and just as brain-hurting as every other time-travel story ever).<br/><br/>At the end of the original adventure, the party's aether-ship had been blown up by sabouteurs in a spectacular explosion. This event was highly traumatic for both the characters and the real-world players, as the ship had been around since the original campaign that I played in and it was essentially their home in the game-world. The party had never found the real culprits, and had since built a new, crappier version of the ship and used it to travel back in time. So, naturally, they ended up having to blow up the ship <i>themselves </i>for complicated macguffinny time-travel reasons - but they stole back the original, better version of the ship and blew up the new, crappier ship instead. My favourite part was the party gathering on a nearby rooftop to enjoy the explosion, and watching the shocked reactions of their past selves, <i>which they had themselves roleplayed</i> ten sessions ago, before sailing back to the future in their beloved original ship.<br/><br/>It wouldn't have worked without extensive GM pre-planning and railroading, but it was just glorious!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344530">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344530/#Comment_344530" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T12:01:55+00:00" title="September 30, 2011 12:01PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems like there would be a processing speed advantage.

What do you do?" is a situation, it kicks off the action, it doesn't necessarily have an outcome to another situation in it. Deciding how the documents should be retrieved, if at all, and in what circumstance, that brackets the situation from the other end.

It seems so subjective that it could encompass almost everything or almost nothing depending on how your approach it. If a player cares about an NPC's attitudes and behavior, and wishes that they could get the NPC to stop being such a jerk, but the GM thinks that the thoughts and opinions of an NPC aren't fair game for the mechanics (e.g. you can force someone to do something with mechanics, but you can't change their personality), does that count as "planning outcomes" for you?<br/><br/>When I prep for a Mouse Guard mission, I figure out the various obstacles the patrol will be encountering, decide if I'll do a twist or condition if they fail (I never allow a single roll to result in an <i>outcome</i> that prevents the mission from being completed), and figure out where NPCs/animals/situations that will need to be dealt with via conflict mechanics will be. Depending on your definitions, I could have just described myself pre-planning a lot of outcomes. But I'm also leaving some stuff undetermined, such as whether or not they'll encounter the twists, so I don't know if this is the sort of thing you're talking about or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344557/#Comment_344557" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T15:21:16+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  3:21PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2011 3:22PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hooray for dramatically timed narrative beats!  <br/><br/>Yup, the old ways of achieving this are exhausting, but there are a million threads about that, let's keep this one about the positives.<br/><br/><b>As for "not outcomes":</b><br/><br/>Everything that ever happens in any RPG <i>could</i> be looked at as a situation and a "What do you do?"  <br/><br/>I'm talking about events that already made some irrefutable impact on the game <i>before</i> presenting those opportunities.  <br/><br/>And, more specifically, I'm talking about what's enabled by the GM planning those ahead of time.

I will try to clarify further.  First, though, I have to say I'm surprised at the need for clarification.  I thought we all kinda knew what it looks like when the GM makes something happen in play, and the players have no say in it, and how that usually has some downsides.  So why does the GM do it?  Oh, hey, there are upsides too!  Foreshadowing!  Big story reveals!  A plan coming together!  Just like source fiction!  Etc.<br/><br/>That thing.  Doesn't that sound familiar?<br/><br/>Okay, clarification time.  JD, I'm GMing, we're playing a detective game.  I give you murders to solve.  I've given you 6 and you accepted 5 of them.  The one you didn't accept, you had something better to do, which we did, and was fun.  So we all know the game doesn't end when you pass on an assignment.  <br/><br/>So, now I hand you the 7th assignment.  You come up with something better to do.<br/><br/>Either I have pre-planned "JD goes on my mission" or I haven't.  <br/>- If I haven't, you get to go do something else.  <br/>- If I have, then I find some way to get you to go do this thing that I came up with that I know will be super awesome and you will love all the awesome I made up.<br/><br/>I hope that's clear, but it might not be extensible.  So let's say that what I really have pre-planned is this:<br/>- JD sees my cultist take the orb from the dead man's house.<br/><br/>Maybe if you refuse to investigate the murder, I as GM am resourceful enough to find another way to give you that scene.  Maybe I'm not.**<br/><br/>Either way, is there anything I can bring to play by planning in advance for that scene* to happen?  That's the question I want to address in this thread.<br/><br/>Clear yet?<br/><br/>*including you not stopping the cultist from taking the orb, regardless of your feelings on the matter<br/><br/>**My earlier "refusing the assignment means certain death!" was an example of "<i>not</i> resourceful".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344571/#Comment_344571" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T16:41:44+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  4:41PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2011 4:49PM by TomasHVM.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>What types of <i>fun</i> have you seen a GM's planned outcome create?</blockquote>A well designed scenario, well executed, is better than anything.

I've seen great fun rise from total railroading, and from a carefully planned free-form way of playing. <br/><br/>Kicking it off with a great whiplash is good, and then let go of the reins and see what happens ...<br/>Letting it slide into a preplanned middle, with twinges, and then let it slide into an open aftermath, is good too.<br/>Steering it with a firm, but open, hand towards a preplanned ending is good too.<br/><br/>It all depends on how you, as a GM, help your players into the drama. How you lead them. Playing with no prejudice is a good start. ;-)<br/><br/>Maybe you should ask this question in a forum dedicated to classical role-playing games. Then I'm sure you will get a lot of insightful answers ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344572">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344572/#Comment_344572" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T16:42:23+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  4:42PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2011 4:44PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Recommend me a forum!<br/><br/>Also, can you name me a small number of your personal favorite things you've gotten best from well-executed scenarios (the ones which fit what I'm describing)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344573/#Comment_344573" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T17:00:00+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  5:00PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Recommend me a forum!</blockquote>Sorry, you must find them yourself.

As for why "see orb theft" is an outcome, it's because of my assumption that JD's going to care.  If he's just like, "Whatever, moving on," then I as GM did not actually get the outcome I planned for.  Part of my plan is that JD will be like, "No!" or "How intriguing!" or something.

The PCs are now approaching the (planned) climax of the first story arc. In this campaign, there are a bunch of things that are important to the plot that happen NO MATTER WHAT (modulo really crazy stuff). There is no way for the PCs to have the information or opportunities to prevent them.<br/><br/>The main advantage I have noted is that I can foreshadow the hell out of stuff, building a sense of dread and inevitability that is very in-genre and emotionally rewarding for players.<br/><br/>The other advantages include: <br/><br/>props are worth making, as I can reasonably expect that they will come into play and be important. I think I have spent more time and $ on props for this game than ever before, and player responses have been great.<br/><br/>I can adjust pacing as needed by means of scene framing, making sure that none of the developments come "out of nowhere", but are still inevitable.<br/><br/>I can build up certain NPCs as objects of fascination and frustration, as the Pcs keep getting hints of who they are and what they are up to, but not being able to find them or interfere. The reward when they are finally caught up with will be very powerful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344589">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344589/#Comment_344589" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T18:23:21+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  6:23PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 30, 2011 6:24PM by David_Berg.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's one of mine, from about 10 years ago:<br/><br/>I decided that the Mandragons were the arch-villains, but they were kind of reasonable and likable.  I decided the Nightrunners were total dicks, but ultimately small fries up to no great ill.  I decided the Grey Elders were majestic and enigmatic and annoyingly detached.  The Mandragons wanted the doomsday weapon, a sword called Quake, and manipulated the Nightrunners to get it.  The PCs spotted the Nightrunners and began a long endeavor to stop them, eventually turning to the Mandragons for help. <br/><br/>Then one player did something clever and discovered the Mandragons wanted Quake and had lied to him about it.  I hadn't planned that!  I wanted to roll with it, but then that player advocated to the rest of the group that they rally all the allies they could and destroy the Mandragons now.  Which was a good plan!  But I wasn't ready for it.  <br/><br/>The players still needed to know more about my cool villains!  They needed to learn that the Mandragons had manipulated the Nightrunners and assassinated the Grey Elders' leader!  They needed to learn that the Mandragons' reasonable exterior was a facade of their demonic shape-shifting general!<br/><br/>So I ad-libbed all sorts of Mandragon magics and reinforcements, so all of a sudden, no, the players couldn't just attack.  They couldn't beat the Mandragons.  Their best hope was to outrace them to the doomsday weapon.  This bought me time.  <br/><br/>While the players searched for Quake, I slowly fed them clues and messages that revealed the totality of the Mandragons' scheme.  And at each one, the characters were appalled, and the players were impressed.  And then, finally, I fed the players enough resources to go ahead and try their original plan of a full frontal assault.  That seemed more fun than my planned intimate showdown in the secret weapon cave, so I hatched a new plan: <i>massive</i> showdown as the Mandragons emerge <i>with</i> the weapon!<br/><br/>The responses I got from this were more satisfying than anything I've ever gotten from other creative work.  No one's gasped and oohed and aahed at a story I've written or a picture I've drawn or a song I've recorded as much as my players did over this reveal: <i>the Nightrunners only sought Quake because Siltra told them the Grey Elder's death would leave the weapon free for the taking -- and the Mandragons had killed the Elder and corrupted Siltra!</i><br/><br/>This was what I loved about GMing back then.  In fact, this was what originally got me into GMing, when I saw my friends achieve it while GMing for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344591/#Comment_344591" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-30T19:20:48+00:00" title="September 30, 2011  7:20PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some advantages that come to mind:<br/><br/>1. Preparation<br/><br/>If you pre-plan outcomes... you can better prepare them. Let'say you plan a big emotional speech by the Big Bad Guy. Well, you can sit down and carefully write exactly the speech you want, then practice reading in front of a mirror until you get to sound just the way you want.<br/><br/>If you know what's coming... you can make sure you're ready. Which leads me to:<br/><br/>2. Challenge<br/><br/>In a game built around challenging the players, you may be able to raise the bar higher by preplanning events. If you know they'll be in a dark room with five sides, and jumped by two tall three-armed troglodytes, you can take your time to prepare the surroundings and the monsters' stats to be really really challenging to the players (which can be hard to do in some games - maybe you have a group of super-powered munchkins in your game, but they love a harder challenge?).<br/><br/>This one skirts your line of "do we care?", though, which might make not qualify as pre-planned for your purposes. (I like that definition, incidentally.)<br/><br/>3. Acting/Emoting<br/><br/>When you know where things are headed, or at least that they ARE headed in a specific direction, you might be able to focus more on delivery, acting, voices, emotional details, etc. This may be what happened in Todd's game (in that link, "4 out of 7 cried"). By knowing pretty much what was going to happen, the GM could be better able to improvise details or descriptions (or whatever) for maximum impact without having to worry about where it was all headed. <br/><br/>Same thing from the players' side: when they trust they're "on rails", guided carefully by something-or-other (be it the GM or not), they can put more work into their portrayal of that kind of drama. In a railroad where you know you'll be the heroes, you can be more confident in doing brave-but-foolish hero-like things, and give big grandiose speeches. If you're playing Polaris, you know it'll probably be cool if you start foreshadowing your character's tragic downfall from the start.<br/><br/>From what I understand, some Nordic LARP/jeepform takes this to another level by letting everyone know where things are headed, and leaving the player's only job the thorough and high-level portrayal of that path. Someone whispers into your ear, "You are falling in love with her," and the player can dedicate him or herself to portraying that as skillfully as possible.<br/><br/>In the same way, if your goal is "immersion" inside your character's head, and in their emotions, maybe playing a strongly pre-planned story allows you to immerse yourself in the current moment where your character is standing, and really "feel" what the character is experiencing.<br/><br/><br/>(Full disclosure: I have pretty much always enjoyed un-planned games far more than pre-planned ones.

I don't buy it. give people a place to start and they will naturally build things unique and interesting on top of it.<br/><br/>Player's and GMs do not need to bleed for a few hours of world or character creation to create a good game they are engaged with. so put down that knife and stop cutting yourself... that is the job of a game designer.<br/><br/>So what are the benefits of pre-play when done by a game designer? many. <br/><br/>Specifics help people chose what game they feel like playing at the moment. they also help player's at the table understand what type of story they are telling and avoid saying or doing things that don't fit.<br/><br/>Offering specific and directed choice keeps the game focused while also keeping players engaged.<br/><br/>Structure helps define a game's play time and player count, these are critical aspects when people choose what game to play and when. they are also things that help game designers develop games.<br/><br/>I'm all for pre-play but i try to do it in the 9-5 and not on my weekends.<br/><br/>this is the kind of stuff i'm talking about if your wondering <a href="http://atarashigames.wordpress.com/2011/09/22/b-x-b-boy-x-boy-yaoi-explosion-and-why-traditional-game-design-kind-of-sucks/" rel="nofollow">GxB</a><br/><br/>Edit: oh i forgot to add that anyone who preps a game should think of themselves as a game designer, not as a gm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344602/#Comment_344602" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T00:31:00+00:00" title="October  1, 2011 12:31AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>And, more specifically, I'm talking about what's enabled by the GM planning those ahead of time.  "In tonight's session, the players will glimpse but not catch the murderer, feel menaced by the supervillain, watch their best friend get stabbed and find their notes stolen!"<br/><br/>What fun stuff can the GM bring to the game by doing that?</blockquote>\nOh, oh, oh!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>As for virtues of pre-planning, I know we've both played plenty of<i>non</i>-scripted games that were emotionally/dramatically satisfying.  Would you say that GM-planned outcomes can deliver this<i>moreso</i>?</blockquote>\nAh, ah, ah!<br/><br/>:hand up: I got this.<br/><br/>I was totally going to say "No." to "Moreso?" but then I thought more about it. I've seen emotionally/dramatically very satisfying moments in non-preplanned games, first hand and second hand, which is why I don't think pre-planning delivers them any more satisfyingly. But! Let's look at D&amp;D for example, right? (for further clarity, I'm going to be talking about post-3.x D&amp;D more specifically)<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, by the rules, you <i>don't reliably get emotionally satisfying moments</i>, except in combat. The "play to find out what happens" of D&amp;D is "can you beat this encounter", yeah? I've been in D&amp;D combats where the outcome was pre-decided by the DM and it was <i>boooring</i>. But outside of combat there is scarcely any structure to the game to guarantee emotional/dramatic beats of any value (they've tried with skill challenges, I guess, but I haven't yet heard any exciting AP stories about skill challenges). So outside of combat D&amp;D easily slips into "aimless wandering". Which is why the DM needs to plot story arcs and stuff to string these encounters into some satisfying whole, a greater narrative. So as far as D&amp;D is concerned, yes, pre-planning definitely delivers the emotional punch <i>moreso</i>. You could even say the game wouldn't pack any emotional punch whatsoever if it wasn't for planning! For example: there's is a whole history of D&amp;D DM techniques for making villains escape, as evidenced by internet discussions. Outside the naturally exciting combat of playing to see if you can win, D&amp;D largely relies on the DM's hands firmly on the steering wheel, to provide the necessary dramatic beats.<br/><br/>(Now, there is <i>another way to play D&amp;D</i>, without planning, but I'm going to ignore that for now.)<br/><br/>So the answer depends on the game. Because other games, like Dogs in the Vineyard for example, pre-planning outcomes would make the play <i>boooring</i>, but they successfully deliver narrative beats and emotional punches without planning outcomes, yeah? But then, the tactical question of "can you beat this" is suddenly made less relevant, it's not what provides satisfaction anymore. The easiest way to show this is: have the Dogs gang up on any enemy. Playing Dogs tactically-minded to see if you can beat the challenge is <i>boooring</i>.  (Also relevant here is Vincent's account of his old Ars Magica game, specifically the encounter with the dragon. The PCs were rolling d20s, the dragon a d6. So there was no way, mechanically, for the dragon to win. But it was an exciting conflict, because it wasn't about "can you beat the dragon?" but "what do you do?/what does the conflict reveal about our characters?".)<br/><br/>Still with me? Tell me if this makes sense to you. I've got more, but I don't want to jump too far ahead.<br/><br/>(As an aside, <a href="/forums/profile/Tyler">@Tyler</a>: prepping a game as a designer - there's definitely truth to that statement.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344603/#Comment_344603" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T01:10:15+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  1:10AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2011 2:36AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jenskot</cite>When a GM takes control of a player's character for the purpose of making a better emotional / dramatic story.</blockquote>I find this thread to be broader than that. But taking control of PC (or having them act out of instinct in certain situations) is something you should do on a fairly regular basis, when GM'ing. You would miss out on great opportunities otherwise.<br/><br/>Here's an example of how you may lead a group of players into hell, and have them thank you for it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>- making 30 players (and 5 GMs) shaky with revulsion over their own actions, after a hard war-scenario, was eyeopening</blockquote>This is how we set it up ...<br/><br/><b>ERA OF THE WORM</b><br/>("worm" alluding to armies on the march, snaking through the lands. And of course; alluding to the poison of war)<br/><br/>This scenario is pretty railroaded. The characters are scouts/warriors under commando, as part of an army. Follow orders, or be considered a coward and/or traitor.<br/><br/><b>- The first part</b> is your farewell to the village you live in, your close family and friends. Then you don your sack of provisions, and your snow-shoes, take up your weapon, and march towards a village in enemy country. Hard march in winter-conditions, and secrecy is of the essence. No witnesses to the march must be left alive. Preplanned scene: the characters happens upon a mother and small boy in the woods. The boy runs towards them, enthusiastic about though men with swords ... What do you do? Do you leave these two as witnesses?\n<blockquote>One group went against orders, and let these two go. After the attack it came out, and spoiled the political effect of the attack (breaking up the alliance of the enemy). That earned them the full derision of their brothers in arms; <i>So we bloodied our arms, only to see that our sacrifice was for naught, due to you not doing your part! Phew!</i></blockquote>\n<b>- The second part</b> is the attack on the village. You don the tabards of an ally of the village, and attack the unsuspecting village in pre-dawn, burning roofs, plundering essential food-stores, hacking down anyone. The fight is given as a pre-planned list of situations, that the GM's throw at the players, <i>in furious tempo</i>. We demand answers to threats the very second they are perceived (to simulate the stress of real combat). There's next to no die-throwing; only shadows, movements, cries and brutality, and characters/players making dire choices to survive. In the darkness and chaos they hack at anything that comes upon them; old men, naked women, screaming children, a dead man hanging on a wall by a spear, their own bloody comrades, etc-etc-etc. It goes on for a lot of rounds. It is supposed to end when a horn is blown, but we pack that info into more stressed and bloody situations, and predictable; not all players realize the horn has sounded. So the bloody killings go on a bit, after the attack has been blown off ...<br/><br/><b>- The third part</b> is you gathering for the march home. Now we slow down the tempo to a crawl; giving the characters/players ample time to consider what they have done. Describing how they avoid the eyes of each other, how some vomit in the snow, and how some sit and stare at bloody hands, making no move to wash it off. We let one soldier be an coldhearted idiot, asking the characters how many they killed ... bragging about killing 23 adults and 9 children himself. No one touches him; all have the same blood on their hands. And we keep that mood throughout the march home. Setting scenes with fellow warriors despairing over their own guilt, hanging themselves, crying, trying to put a brave face on it, etc. This dreary march is mirrored by the brave march they made at the start of the scenario.<br/><br/><b>- The fourth and last part,</b> is you coming home to your own village. You are received as heroes. Your younger brother wants you to tell how many you killed. Your father thumps your shoulder, and your mother wants to hug you (but she looks like a woman you killed, so you involuntarily steps back from her, eyes wide). And a great feast is organized, to celebrate the heroes and the victory. You all have to participate in it, listening to speeches, getting heroes gifts, being looked up to ... and all the time there are details reminding you of the village you burned and brutalized.<br/><br/><b>END OF SCENARIO</b><br/><br/>It was a mental effort leading this game. The reigns were tight and the theme challenging. We GMs came out of it with full honors, but feeling dirty and evil and mean, by having put our players trough so much shit. I've never played a scenario that made me feel I should apologize to the players afterwards, for being a good GM.<br/><br/>The players came out of it really shaken. The scenario was a well orchestrated attack on all their moral self, putting them in the unforgiving shoes of a soldier in the chaos of battle, having them, by their own hasty choices, perpetrating acts of brutality that went against all they believed in, and against what they really wanted to be. They came out of it as the characters; with their ethics under attack, their social skills in tatters, and their soul in turmoil.<br/><br/>One of them said;<i> I never knew role-playing could be so good, and gruesome!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344604">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344604/#Comment_344604" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T01:16:23+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  1:16AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I still don't get it.

Most of the players that participated in this had read the convention-blurb, telling it would be a hard war-scenario. They still came into it unprepared. Nothing I write can prepare players for a game that engage them so profoundly.<br/><br/>So I had instructed the GMs to make a debrief after the game, giving the players that wanted to talk about it, the chance to do so. The great majority of them declined; they wanted to be alone with their feelings, and their thoughts; it was a very though-provoking game, and the players had all the woeful details of it at their hands, when we had finished. I know some of them backed out of later role-playing sessions at the convention, to go home and mull over the game they had played.<br/><br/>Most of them waited to the day after, to seek me up and tell me what an amazing game it had been.<br/><br/>The scenario gives you some valuable insights in how a soldier in the field is required to sacrifice some of his humanity, to wield his weapon. It was a simulation of war, but not the heroic sword-wielding genre-cliche; a realistic simulation of the human condition of the soldier in the field, and how he fares at home, after being brutalized. <br/><br/>And it gives the insights by letting the participants <i>experience</i> how this comes about, not <i>showing</i> or <i>telling</i> them. It's ability to create first-hand <i>experience</i> of moral dilemmas is the real strength of role-playing games, in my opinion. <br/><br/>In my mind this scenario certainly goes to show that careful planning enables you to lead games that soars to hitherto unknown heights.<br/><br/><i>PS: In a country that has been at continuous war for 40 years now (USA), such a scenario should be very interesting (and important) to play ...</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344614/#Comment_344614" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T04:17:35+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  4:17AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2011 4:18AM by Teataine.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Gregor, I think what you're saying makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>So that is one thing that GM-planned outcomes can do: bring drama and emotion into games that otherwise lack them.<br/><br/>If you wanted to go further, what I'd ask is: do the planned outcomes in D&amp;D provide anything that you don't get in (properly played) Dogs?<i>More</i>drama/emotion?

I'll try to unpack.<br/><br/>Here's what's clicking for me:<br/>The core conceit of all roleplaying games is pretending, playing as-if. It is, in its most basic meaning, <b>play</b>. But there has to be a point to it, some <i>payoff</i> (just pretending is aimless). The payoff is different for different games. I'd suggest there are a handful of types of payoff, and different people, different groups enjoy one, some or all of them. Coming into a game you expect such payoff, consciously or not. It's what we find <i>satisfying</i> when sitting down and playing.<br/><br/>When you don't get that payoff, whether you've consciously identified it or not, the game is <i>boooring</i> (yes I'm using that as a term).<br/><br/>In the sort of game Thomas describes (norwegian-style, jeep?), pre-plotting definitely serves a certain kind of satisfying payoff. <i>But it excludes others</i>. Like, if I came into that game expecting the payoff of a tactical challenge, that would suck for me. You need to get in tune with what the game is offering to enjoy it. Similarly if Thomas and his team of GMs actually allowed a chance of the players, I dunno, deserting, or rebelling and turning away, then the whole scenario would have been ruined, right?<br/><br/>I think the payoff of Thomas' game and, for example, Dogs (or perhaps more accurately, Poison'd) is very similar, at least superficially - they are both concerned with brutal, troubling imagery, violence, emotional gut-punching, both seek a focused narrative. But the war scenario is concerned with giving the players an experience, quite literally, of doing terrible things and leaving them with that where Poison'd is (I believe) concerned with letting players decide what to do, and then showing them the consequences. I think those are very different payoffs.<br/><br/>So I think the thing to do is: <br/>-identify and clearly communicate the kind of payoff your game offers<br/>-figure out which parts of the game will bear pre-planning and which won't, to allow that payoff<br/><br/>Going back to D&amp;D - to provide appropriate dramatic elements, the DM has to plan story arcs, but the payoff of play is in the open-ended combats. As long as the DM's story only serves as the frame for the players' strategic and tactical decisions, that enriches the experience while supporting the payoff of tactical play. But when the DM's plots begin to intrude upon the player's decisions (like pre-determining the outcome of a combat because "that's what the story demands") then the tactical play payoff is killed. You can totally begin to drift the game in the direction of a different payoff, and turn that game into something like Thomas' scenario! But you've lost a different kind of payoff.<br/><br/>So, as a bottom line so far, I'd say pre-plotting (I actually prefer pre-deciding or pre-determining), is definitely a technique that can be applied to support (or block! it's neutral) different payoffs of play. <br/><br/>Identifying the specific payoffs of pre-play determination is harder, because it's reliant on actual play examples. But I'm pretty sure that the main payoff that pre-determining stuff can provide is the <i>accuracy</i>, or <i>correctness</i> of the experience (much as I said in my first post). Even more specifically, I think this implies an overall passivity on part of the player, who is being led through a dream like a somnambulist, being-john-malkovich-ed, put-in-a-VR, sensorium-stoned, immersed, walked-in-another's-shoes, body-swapped, is getting a transfusion (<i>bleed</i>) from the fictional persona.

Transplanted. Maybe I should say "raptured" instead. It's a dream-like experience, I think, with varying degrees of "lucid dreaming".

On the other hand... well, one of my favorite games was an online game of WHFRPG I played on RPG.Net.  The pitch for the game involved  a bunch of young toughs who hang out at a seedy Altdorf bar together, do a simple job for easy money, and get into political and mystical intrigues way over their heads.  And the game was exactly what it said on the tin! We made characters, took the job, things got progressively more complicated and greyer, and eventually we were all deep in a web of interlocking conspiracies.  One awesome gothic scene after another.  I never felt any frustration that the game wasn't under my control -- of course it wasn't!  It was the GM's game and he was taking me to some awesome places. <br/><br/>This is the way many role-players do their thing, isn't it?

plan.<br/><br/><br/>Tomas,<br/><br/>I really enjoyed reading your post about the "war scenario". I can certainly see how that would be a very high-impact, emotional game.<br/><br/>Can you tell us a little more about what happens during the middle action (the battle scene in the village)? Maybe an example of what "play" looks like in that moment.<br/><br/>Most traditional descriptions of roleplaying include something along the lines of, "GM delivers description/challenge, then says, 'What do you do?'"<br/><br/>What does it look like in your scenario? To what extent are you taking control of the player's character during that scene? As a player in that scene, what kinds of choices do I have to make? Or do I just let go of the reins completely and let you guide me, while I experience it?<br/><br/><br/>(As an aside, John's definition - "When a GM takes control of a player's character for the purpose of making a better emotional / dramatic story" - is quite a good one. It is either identical, or similar to, the old Forge definition of "GM Force." However, in most "typical" RPG play, it's not done as overtly as what Tomas is describing. For instance, the GM might say, "Which way do you go, up the cliff, or through the city?" It seems like a player choice. But if the GM has decided that, no matter which is chosen, the players will meet a Sphinx, then the GM has effectively taken control of a the player's character: it is effectively not terribly different from saying, "You now decide to go meet the Sphinx." So, I think that's what John was talking about, and I agree with him.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344634">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344634/#Comment_344634" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T10:54:52+00:00" title="October  1, 2011 10:54AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2011 10:58AM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, JD, you're a smart guy, I'm sure you can read everyone else's responses and get the gist of the point of this thread.

"Pre-planned" simply means "anytime before it happened". "Before the session" is the easiest type to spot and discuss, but "right before it happened" has a lot in common with the extended plans. In both cases, the GM is orchestrating the players' experience toward a particular GM vision of how things should go, and plopping down important developments without the players getting a say.<br/><br/>A reflexive "oh shit, can't let the players do that!" is <i>not</i> a good example of planning. But, in some cases, it reflects that there <i>is</i> a plan.<br/><br/>My plan was: <b>the players have a campaign-ending showdown with the Mandragons after learning all about what they'd done</b>. I engaged in a combination of scheming and planning and inspired ad-lib and desperate reacting to pull this off, but one way or another, I was gonna make it happen, regardless of what the players did. <i>That's</i> the good example. Cuz you can (hopefully) see why I wanted to do it and what we (especially me) got out of it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344651">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344651/#Comment_344651" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T12:51:44+00:00" title="October  1, 2011 12:51PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>I don't know... that sounds like planning an outcome but NOT making any kind of good contingency plan.</blockquote>\nWait, so contingency plans are part of this? I thought if you were planning for contingencies you were NOT planning outcomes.<br/><br/>If I make a list of 20-30 things characters might do, and expected consequences for each decision, is this planning outcomes then?<br/><br/>Ok, I hope this doesn't derail us.<br/><br/>I was trying to point out that in your example the problem wasn't the plan itself, but the method chosen for enforcing it. (As Dave pointed out, too.) If the GM chose to put their plan up front -- "Sorry, guys, this session is about going left" -- or if the GM was more subtle -- "OK, fine, I'll just switch 'left' with 'right', so they go left anyway" -- then we would be dealing with an entirely different set of problems.<br/><br/>There are all sorts of ways of dealing with planning at the table. For example, a player who has a specific plan ("This game is about my character doing X!") can stubbornly refuse to engage with anything that doesn't relate to X. In a traditional RPG setup, a player has less authority to enforce their plan than a GM does, but it can still affect the game in a very powerful way (especially if, say, the player begins playing psychological games with the rest of the group, trying to manipulate them into getting the game to go their way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344652">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344652/#Comment_344652" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T13:21:50+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  1:21PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2011 1:44PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a bit outside the thread-theme, but you asked ...<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Can you tell us a little more about what happens during the middle action (the battle scene in the village)?

Some of these situations demands less from the characters/players, some demands a lot. Here's an example of actual play, as I recall it, transcribed to english:<br/><br/><span style="font-family: Georgia;"><span style="color: #660000;">- GM is standing, pointing at a player, shouting: <i>You turn, and get blood in your face.

What do you do?<br/>- Player B: I run her through with my spear!<br/>- GM: She stiffens, turns, astonished, and you recognize her!

He falls! The others attack you! Roll the die for the fight!<br/>- GM points at player E: you have no spear, so you have -5 to the roll!

Evil demon! </i> What do you do?<br/>- Player B: I kill him!<br/>- GM: You split his skull open! The crying stops!<br/><br/>(turns to other player, pointing)<br/>- GM talks calmly, suddenly: You stand n the muck and snow, and no one is near you. You are so bloodied and tired, and no one is attacking you. But the battle is not over. You look around, and you are in the plaza in the midst of the village, but do not understand why no one is here. You stand there, and ponder what to do ... Why do you hear so many shouts and screams?<br/>- Player (confused): Eh ... I do not know ... eh ...<br/>- GM (calmly): You are certain it has nothing to do with you. They are dying somewhere else. You are not attacked. You are safe.<br/>- Player says nothing.<br/>- Gm says nothing, breathing audibly for a small moment.<br/><br/>(GM turns to two other players, pointing)<br/>- GM shouting again: Two bearded men with great timber-axes are swinging at you! What do ...<br/><br/>etc.</span></span><br/>__________________________<br/><br/>When the tempo is on, you have no problem coming up with new situations, so you may go on spreading blood and gore on the table for a period that may seem indefinite to the players (as you do this, players really loose their sense of time). <br/><br/>As the dreadful slaughtering goes on, the GM asks the players to help frame situations too;<br/>- <i>You stand by a burning house; what do you see? Is anyone attacking you? How many?<br/>- What is happening to you, right now? Where are you? Tell us what you see!<br/>- The two of you is doing something! What?</i> <br/><br/><b>3 ESSENTIAL TECHNIQUES</b><br/><br/>--&gt; <b>Killing tempo</b> <br/>The battle is done in ferocious tempo. The list helps you gear up to really fast tempo, so no one can relax between situations they take part in. We end encounters by simply turning to new players, starting new encounters. This keeps all players on their toes, ready to go. The players get pumped up, with adrenaline, by the tempo. And that in turn, keeps the battle alive and acute. We do this to mirror the crazy tempo and chaos of a real fight in the night, and to mirror the panic of humans in such conditions. <br/><br/>--&gt; <b>Postponed reflections</b> <br/>The overall effect is that each and every player make a lot of choices, in the heat of the moment, and none of them gets to ponder anything very much (except for the pause-situation, which is thrown in for contrast). The full weight of the choices is left for them to ponder in the aftermath, when the tempo is dropped to a slow pondering crawl. And the painful emotional implications will begin to show when they return home, to families/friends/lovers, and a heroes welcome ...<br/><br/>--&gt; <b>Using instinctive reactions</b> <br/>The players instinctively react to the shouting and gesticulating GM, building up adrenaline, and thus they share in the fear and aggression of the characters. This is done to mirror the adrenaline of real soldiers. The technique is simple, and effective.<br/><br/>--&gt; <b>Bring the character to the crux</b> <br/>No character dies in these encounters. If a player rolls abysmal, we let the character have a scar or some bad trait for it. We do not explain how they survive. They do. Miraculously or shamefully. The characters are important vehicles for the aftermath. Without characters living through the aftermath, feeling the pain and shame, this battle is meaningless (in the context of the narrative, that is).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344657/#Comment_344657" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T14:39:19+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  2:39PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>My plan was:<b>the players have a campaign-ending showdown with the Mandragons after learning all about what they'd done</b>.

Because I can certainly envision a player who doesn't really care about how they reach that point so long as you adjudicate <i>what happens in the showdown</i> fairly.  They might simply not identify this as an outcome at all.  "It was really great you didn't pre-plan the outcome of our campaign, David!" they might say, clapping you on the back and shaking your hand.  "You could have made it so those Mandragons beat us, or we beat them, but it was completely fair and open-ended! Great job not planning the outcome!"<br/><br/>Similarly in my Dragonlance example, a group of people who were enthused by the over-powerful monsters immolating the party might high-five each other at the end of the TPK, crowing about how long they lasted against the monsters.

But we're forgetting or skewing a lot of the potential for pre-planned, prepped, or pre-plotted games.  Railroad has become a four letter word.<br/><br/>I love a pre-planned game.  I'm fine with outcomes that are inevitable, even when i know what they will be (though i'd prefer to find out).  I see the strengths of planning a game giving you richer detail and a stronger GM control, and even more than that.  But it's still being associated with a person manipulating the people around them.  And so Illusionism becomes a new four letter word.<br/><br/>You don't prep a game, or it's plot points, in order to manipulate people.  You don't prep a game to impress your crowd.  <i>You do it as a gift to the people playing your game.</i>  Prep is bad when it's manipulation.  It's good when it's the act of crafting something for people, like a gift.  Bad prep is showing off and not letting people participate.  Good prep is creating something heavily tied to what your players love and want to see.  It's the art of building sockets into the game they're playing that they can plug into.  A good designer-prepped game system will build generic sockets for people to plug into - and those can be all you need.  But if you're good at prepping a game you'll do more than just uncover the game-designed sockets.  You'll build your own.  They will be shaped perfectly for the friend you've got sitting at your table.  And that's what will yield the real "Ooohs" and "Aaaahs."  That's when the big reveal isn't just a railroad, it's a friggin rocket ship going straight where they want it to go.<br/><br/>There's a lot of discussion about this in theater improvisation, and i wish it was talked about more here.  About how to take a cue from someone, how to build with someone instead of blocking them, how to understand and communicate in a way that doesn't have to be taken out of the fiction and explained.  A good pre-prepped game is going to work well if the GM is building something for their friends, but it works even better if the players are looking for the big reveal, if everyone is cooperating.  It takes trust.  It takes focus on what the other people around you are interested in.  It takes the willingness to just communicate what you want to see.<br/><br/>There's gotta be a better way to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344659/#Comment_344659" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-01T16:05:19+00:00" title="October  1, 2011  4:05PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 1, 2011 4:06PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: graypawn</cite>We've gotten really good at playing a game rich in detail by making up the fiction on the fly.

Also like RPG, it is a narrative medium, and a goal of many creators is to avoid the railroaded, pre-determined plot, to live up to the "interactive" part of "interactive fiction." Many works of interactive fiction therefore tend to have either a branching path structure to their narrative, or a limited sandbox structure. However, one of the greatest and most influential works of interactive fiction, <a href="http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ju778uv5xaswnlpl" rel="nofollow">Photopia</a>, is a heavily railroaded, single path, pre-determined story. The really interesting thing about it, though, is that it would not work at all as a traditional prose short story. It would be too cliched, too heavy-handed, to make the reader feel the emotion the writer wants them to feel. But, because of the very slight interactivity of the medium, which, in this case involves no choices which can actually affect the outcome or the path of the story, the player feels involved in the story, and feels a much stronger emotional effect than they would with a traditional, non-interactive, narrative medium.</p>\n<p>I think this involvement with a pre-planned narrative is exactly what GM pre-play can do well as well. The GM can write a story, like they would write a novel or a film, and they can more easily get the player-audience to have an emotional connection to the story by use of interaction, even without allowing the players meaningful choice.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344686/#Comment_344686" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-02T08:31:06+00:00" title="October  2, 2011  8:31AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 2, 2011 8:34AM by jenskot.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Berg</cite>Actually, wait, JD did make one good point that I definitely ought to respond to:<b>duration of planning</b>. "Pre-planned" simply means "anytime before it happened". "Before the session" is the easiest type to spot and discuss, but "right before it happened" has a lot in common with the extended plans. In both cases, the GM is orchestrating the players' experience toward a particular GM vision of how things should go, and plopping down important developments without the players getting a say. </blockquote>\nI think this is what is throwing some people off.<br/><br/>If "pre-planned" means both "before the session" and "right before something happens", it doesn't sound much like pre-planning. <br/><br/>It gets more complicated when I take into consideration that every "pre-planning" GM I've known doesn't hesitate to change any of their plans on the fly if they come up with a better idea in play, perhaps still sticking with their overall theme / vision, but straying away from their plan. The actual plan part doesn't seem like the most important part here.<br/><br/>"GM vision" may be the key factor. <br/><br/>It's why I defined this initially as "when a GM takes control of a player's character for the purpose of making a better emotional / dramatic story." I suspect people would prefer "when a GM changes the world\u2026" instead of "control a player's character\u2026". But the examples used in this thread support this being more than controlling the world and extend into controlling a player's character:<br/><br/>- "When the supervillain twirls his cape and it is menacing. No, really. You feel menaced."<br/><br/>- "anything that matters to the players that they can't [snip] opt out of"<br/><br/>Can prep, pre-play, or planning be a part of all this? Yes! Is it always a part of this? I don't believe so. It is possible to talk just about pre-planning but we may need to narrow many of the definitions in this thread and eliminate some of the examples. <br/><br/>That all said, pre-play has positives!<br/><br/>I know players who can't immerse unless the GM pre-plays. If they feel the GM is "making it up" on the fly, they feel the game has no weight or meaning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344687/#Comment_344687" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-02T08:46:21+00:00" title="October  2, 2011  8:46AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I gamed with 2 people who only felt comfortable with Mouse Guard if the twists were pre-planned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_344695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344695/#Comment_344695" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-02T11:54:28+00:00" title="October  2, 2011 11:54AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John, those are good points, but I'm resisting narrow definitions, for the sake of inclusivity.

I have had a few immersive experiences where, looking back, I couldn't draw a distinct line between what was me thinking as the character or the character thinking as me.

One player was playing Wedge Antilles. The other player was playing a smuggler of his own invention.  I had the Star Wars soundtrack playing on loop in another room - loud enough to be heard clearly when attention was drawn to it, but mostly faded into the background.<br/><br/>The time: Pre-New Hope.<br/><br/>At one point they were on Alderaan.  I mentioned a strange, small looking moon appeared in the sky. Alderaan had no moons. I also had Wedge's very willful astromech choose this time to go exploring the city. They players knew what the outcome was going to be. They weren't going to save the planet, and in fact, it was going to be destroyed any second. This added some great urgency to the situation that wouldn't have been there otherwise.<br/><br/>Later, during the death star run, Wedge gets damaged and needs to pull back. Well, the player decides he's going to risk it and try to take this thing down and not leave Luke alone after Biggs is taken out. I was fine with this since I didn't really want to have it all about NPCs.  Two things happened. The first was the player got a FANTASTIC roll, beyond legendary, when firing his proton torpedoes. Luke was still there, but it added into our story a question of who really blew up the Death Star.  The second part, which was more coincidence, is I noticed that the music was approaching the finale. So I drew out the medal awarding (in addition to Luke, Han, Chewie, were Wedge, and the other smuggler) ending it right when the end credits crescendo starts. Hitting that point, we all felt like we'd just (re-)made a Star Wars movie.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344852/#Comment_344852" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T14:34:39+00:00" title="October  4, 2011  2:34PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2011 11:34PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Was off topic, so I edited to keep in line.</i><br/><br/>The virtues of GM pre-planning is many. It's maybe the main reason classical role-playing games still have a large following. <br/><br/>Designers pre-planning, or helping GMs pre-plan, is a part of it. <br/><br/>If you look at modern games, a lot of them are pre-planned extraordinaire; there is no way you may play anything other than what the designer had in mind. Many modern games got one single scenario, and that's it. But this is important: the whole game is focused on it, so they do this single scenario very well. <br/><br/>There's a good reason for this; a well laid plan, with good execution, is THE most certain way for the players towards the fabled heaven of interactivity.<br/><br/>Why?<br/><br/>The answer is: deep thinking, careful inventiveness, testing and discussions. In short; good planning!<br/><br/>Ideas are born, and tried out, and reflected upon, before they are rejected or presented as part of a game. There is a plan to the method, a goal-driven interactivity that the players are made part of. So there is sense and synergy to the game-play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_344858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344858/#Comment_344858" name="Item_72" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-04T15:47:01+00:00" title="October  4, 2011  3:47PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 4, 2011 3:49PM by David_Berg.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's way off topic.

I'll give two examples from my convention games and then offer what good I think comes of each.<br/><br/>[Background that may be helpful as you read the text below: I run all of my adventures as if they were movies. We talk about camera angles, voice-overs, cut scenes, the whole nine yards. One of the systems that I currently use is Hollow Earth Expedition (HEX). HEX characters have something called Style Points, which can be used to augment die rolls, reduce damage etc.]<br/><br/><b>Example the First:</b> From my HEX scenario for this year. At the start of the session, I explain to the players that this adventure focuses on <i>action</i>, a la an Indiana Jones movie. Their job is to keep the audience on the edge of their seats. I then open the adventure with bad guys stealing a crate of something from a university. The PCs see the bad guys from a distance as the bad guys load the crate into a truck and start to drive off. My intent is to have an exciting car chase with lots of over-the-top stunts.<br/><br/>About half the time, it doesn't occur to the players to chase after the truck. Some will react as if it's a real-world situation ("I write down the license plate number"). Some will attempt to bring the action to an abrupt halt ("I shoot out the truck's tires"). In those cases, I usually say, "Rewind. Remember two minutes ago when I told you to make an action movie? A truck is <i>driving away</i> with stolen property? What would Indiana Jones do?" That's always been enough to make the lightbulb go on. I've never had to tell players, "Chase the truck!" Although I would tell them that, if I had to.<br/><br/>The Good That Follows: I want an opening scene that shows off what the game system can do and sets the tone of my movie. That's my job as the GM of a convention game. I've planned events within the car chase that will give the players opportunities to be creative and will give them something to react to. This scene will also let them discover how I apply the rules to over-the-top action, because no two GMs use the rules of a game in exactly the same way.<br/><br/>But here's where the real GM fiat comes in. As soon as the car chase starts, I say: "Here are the rules for the car chase: (1) The bad guys are going to get away with the crate. That's just the way it is. (2) Pretend you don't know that. Make the car chase as exciting as you possibly can. If you come up with an ingenious idea that should stop the truck from getting away, you'll also need to show the audience why that idea fails. Any of the resources that you spend this scene (Style Points, ammunition, whatever) will be returned to you at the end of the scene -- plus additional Style Points, the number of which will depend upon how exciting a scene you make this. (3) The car chase will last exactly as long as you want it to. When you're ready to move onto something else, the bad guys will get away."<br/><br/>Most of my players have played out the car chase scene for about an hour and a half. It's almost half of my adventure.<br/><br/>In case it's not obvious, the second half of the adventure is the recovery of the crate. The reason the bad guys' escape is by fiat is so there's something to recover. Happens all the time in action movies.<br/><br/>The Good That Follows: Once those rules sink in, my players have a lot of fun with the car chase. Because they don't have to think about tactics (since the bad guys will get away anyway), they focus on making the scene fun and exciting. Some players will come up with stunts that hinder the PCs, thereby helping to explain why the bad guys were able to get away. I reward those players with extra Style Points, of course.<br/><br/><b>Example the Second:</b> This is from the Unknown Armies adventure that jenskot <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14899" rel="nofollow">mentioned</a> above (which I've permanently retired, by the way). In his character write-up, one of the players is told that his character brings several board games to the first scene. One of the games is Ouija. The player is instructed to ensure that the Ouija game is offered for play.<br/><br/>As soon as the player has his character bring out the Ouija board, I step in as director of the movie and explain to the players that the Ouija game is the Maguffin -- it <i>has</i> to be played. Not all of the PCs have to participate in the game, but none of them can stop it from being played. A character can <i>try</i> to stop it, but that player has to come up with a reason why the effort fails. This discussion is necessary because one of the PCs has a very superstitious mother, and the player of that PC might feel that it would be in character for her to prevent the game from taking place.<br/><br/>The Good That Follows: The adventure is about a haunting. The Ouija game is the primary factor that starts the haunting. It's required in order to keep the storyline tight and to avoid plot holes. The only benefit the players get from this particular GM fiat is that the adventure makes sense.

I really haven't gotten much in the way of flak from players. In fact, the most common complaint I get is that players feel mild peer pressure to come up with creative scenes. In other words, they're slightly stressed by having too much authorship in the face of a blank canvas. (I think that's a mixed metaphor.

Being clear and straightforward in using them, and communicating them, is a great benefit to gaming in general. It's about being a good leader, and imposing structure on our interplay.<br/><br/>Structures help us be creative.

It's going to take about 70 years to get home.  Period."<br/><br/>Lots of stakes-setting games handle these kinds of issues really well, I feel.  Like the car/truck chase: any of the players can simply request, "Hey, can we not make one of the possible outcomes 'we capture the truck'?  And instead if the PCs win the roll they get an important clue or learn about the bad guys' weaknesses?"  (Or something like that.)<br/><br/>Other games make this kind of thing even more explicit, like in Polaris, where the Protagonists simply cannot die except under very constrained circumstances.<br/><br/>Where I find this kind of thing can fail is with a certain strain of trad and/or old-school gamer who doesn't want any spoilers.  In fact, now that I think about it, while OSR and Indie have in common the idea of not pre-planning outcomes, what OSR and Trad have in common is a resistance to overt/explicit structuring of narratives.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_344996">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/344996/#Comment_344996" name="Item_83" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T01:52:45+00:00" title="October  6, 2011  1:52AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 6, 2011 2:42AM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>what OSR and Trad have in common is a resistance to overt/explicit structuring of narratives.</blockquote>I'm not sure what "OSR" stands for (old school role-play; but what sets that apart from Trad?), but I am quite certain that classical role-playing games don't have an inherent resistance to techniques that structures the narrative (I term games with GM "classical", them being "trad" or whatnot).<br/><br/>Classical role-playing games have a great field of dialogue techniques to explore, largely untapped or in unconscious use in todays game-practice. These techniques may be explored and developed further at the courtesy of skilled game-smiths and inventive GMs. There is nothing stopping you from having more tools at hand when playing a classical role-playing game, the tools that focus on <i>the dialogue between players</i>, aka; the psycho-social field where we actually create the <i>fiction *</i> of our games.<br/><br/><i>* A strong and engaging fiction</i> is the final goal for any role-playing game. "The fiction" being our self-made narrative arc, of course, and then some more; it is the small tidbits too, that gives us some experience throughout the game; every small scene, every character involvement and dialogue, every mood-swing related to the character and/or happenings of the game. "The fiction" of a role-playing game is the great total sum of our game-experience. It is both something we share, as a product of our interaction, and something we produce internally, as our imagination and emotions are spurred by our interaction.<br/><br/>I've made a simple <b>3-step model</b> to get to grips with this: <br/>1 - the designer gives us a <b>vision</b>, and a method to go with it ...<br/>2 - that we the players use in our exploratory, dialogue-based <b>interaction</b> ...<br/>3 - to create a <b>fiction</b> (that may be an expression/exploration of the initial vision).<br/><br/>I find this way of thinking, simple and stringent as it is, quite liberating. It clarifies the fact that we have a lot of leeway in how we organize and play our games, and says very clearly what our gaming aims at. We may whisper ourselves towards that high goal, or talk ourselves into it, or scream our heads of in our quest to get there. The tools at our command are ours to make, and is as versatile as anything we may invent.<br/><br/>The interesting thing is that a lot of GMs place themselves in a middle position in this model. They are <i>visionary designers</i> in their pre-planning of a game-session, going further than the game itself supports (tweaking, inventing setting-elements and new methodical tools), and then they are <i>interactive players</i> in the execution of the scenario. <br/><br/>A lot of GMs do a lot of work to make a lot of players have a swell time.

Players of traditional RPGs believe that it's the GMs job to build and describe the world -- erect walls and place doors, so to speak. So you'd think they should be the most comfortable with the GM placing another metaphorical wall by saying, "Here are the things your characters won't be able to do in this scene."<br/><br/>That's immensely different from saying, "Dance, puppet, dance!

Any GM technique can fail with the wrong audience. Some players just won't like this style. It's a matter of taste; no harm, no foul. But my experience has been that for every naysayer, there are many who are just unsure whether this approach will be fun. The latter folks can be won over if the GM presents the idea properly -- and if the players trust him.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345094">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food" title="Will_GM_for_Food"><img alt="Will_GM_for_Food" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Will_GM_for_Food">Will_GM_for_Food</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345094/#Comment_345094" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T18:10:20+00:00" title="October  6, 2011  6:10PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This doesn't quite count as "GM pre-play," but it may come close enough for this discussion.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier that I'm currently running Hollow Earth Expedition, and that HEX has Style Points that players can spend to benefit their characters.<br/><br/>When I'm explaining the rules at the start of the session, I tell players the different in-game benefits that they can buy with Style Points. I then tell them the four ways they can earn Style Points. Ways 1 through 3 are basically rewards for a player's making the kind of movie I want us to make.  <br/><br/>I explain that Way 4 is different. It's not initiated by the player. "The fourth way to earn Style Points starts with me saying something like this: 'Ann, I'm giving you two Style Points for what I'm about to do to your character.' " The players usually laugh at this point. "Whatever I say after that cannot be avoided. Trust me that whatever it is, its sole purpose is to make a better movie."<br/><br/>I've used this technique to have characters get caught in traps, get knocked out, fall down holes, have their weapons jam, fall victims to mind control, all sorts of stuff. Most, but not all, of these obstacles are made up on the fly. (That's why I'm not sure this belongs in the "GM pre-play" conversation, because they're rarely planned.) To the best of my recollection, I've never had a player complain about any of them.<br/><br/>- Todd                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345101/#Comment_345101" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-06T19:43:38+00:00" title="October  6, 2011  7:43PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tomas your post has nothing to do with what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>I'm talking about game rules that specify things like a countdown clock, or each player getting a certain number of scenes, or us knowing ahead of time when it's okay for the bad guy to die, or whatever.<br/><br/>Specifically, I'm discussing mechanics, not techniques.

If you can get buy-in for <i>that</i>, I'd guess you can get buy-in for <i>anything</i>; it really opens up the possibilities for what outcomes a GM can consider planning.<br/><br/>Can you share an anecdote about knocking out, mind-controlling, or imprisoning a player character, and how that made the game awesome in a way it wouldn't have been otherwise?<br/><br/>I can't help also asking <i>how</i>, but I'll do that in <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15178&amp;page=1#Item_8" rel="nofollow">the other thread</a>.

They are grown from a specific GM-style, and they do need meta-knowledge, of course, to play. But they've developed a certain norm in how the meta-level is organized, under the influence of the "patriarch" GM-style (the benign patriarch running the game with a firm grip on every aspect of it). I suspect that the minute their patriarch GM introduce elements like a countdown clock, destiny-play or whatnot, the "resistance" felt by such players would rapidly melt away before his stern face.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>As to the difference between an OSR GM and a Trad GM: the former is supposed to be an emotionally neutral referee and exert as little control over the game as possible, functioning basically as a physics engine and the eyes and ears of the players via their characters.

Sigh!<br/><br/>Both these styles of play are well known and old-fashioned. There have been, and are far better ways to be a GM both yesternight and nowadays; middle roads between these two, and venues of play founded on tools and techniques not in their arsenal.

Why? <br/><br/>Why should I not pre-plan a great plot to my trad-game, and take the liberty of making the players party to it? It may give us some great game-play of a different kind.<br/><br/>Why should I not pre-plan a great plot in my OSR-game? I'm still able to GM it as before, and it may give our game-play some twists that the designer of the game has not thought of.<br/><br/>Why should I not pre-plan in secret, in my indie classical rpg? It may give my players some delightful surprises, some delighfully wicked game-play, and give their view on trust and daring in role-playing games a much needed broadening of perspective.<br/><br/>Why choose to fetter ourselves in needless irons of the mind? Role-playing is all about being free to explore; so why not make that part of our philosophy on the games themselves too?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345180/#Comment_345180" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-07T07:44:10+00:00" title="October  7, 2011  7:44AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please?
