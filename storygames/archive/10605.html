I've been wanting to run a Delta Green/Cthulhuesque campaign for a while, but running it straight using straight CoC never seemed to work for me.  I thought I'd start a new thread rather than raising the last one from the dead again. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Looking at the thread and the beautiful character sheet, I can see how the skills connect between versions, except for battle.  There's a section in the back of the book that suggests weapons changes for a modern campaign as:<br/><br/>Bow -&gt; Assault Rifles<br/>Javelin -&gt; Submachine Guns<br/>Spear -&gt; Shotgun<br/>Sword -&gt; Pistol<br/><br/>That's clear enough -- but it's the combat skills on the Dagon sheet that lose me.<br/><br/>The original has: Sword/Spear/Aim/Shield, and the Dagon sheet has: Rifle/Submachine Gun/Shotgun/Dodge.<br/><br/>And I'm not sure how the dice work here.  In base Agon (as I understand it) you can put your Shield die in your left hand if you're carrying one, and you can choose either your shield or your weapon skill die in either hand. Also, Aim is used for both Bows and Javelins.<br/><br/>So how does this carry over to DAGON?  Does Rifle = Aim and Dodge = Shield?  And characters simply don't have the option of carrying a shield (and thus the die for it)?<br/><br/>What I mean:<br/><br/>In Agon: I'm carrying a shield (1d8) in my left hand and a sword (2d6, R1) in my right.  On any particular turn, I can decide to go offensive (my Sword skill die in my right hand) or defensive (my Shield skill die in my left).<br/><br/>In Dagon: I'm carrying a pistol (2d6, 1R) in my right hand.  On any particular turn, I can go offensive (my Pistol? skill die in my right -- I guess the DAGON sheet assumes something like Shotgun for 1R) or defensive (my Dodge skill die in my left).  There is simply no such thing as a shield die, though characters can wear modern equivalents of armor as usual.<br/><br/>What I'm thinking of doing is taking the Dagon skills as:<br/><br/>Sword -&gt; Pistol<br/>Spear -&gt; Shotgun<br/>Shield -&gt; Dodge<br/>Aim -&gt; Aim<br/><br/>...with Aim being used for Submachine Guns and Assault Rifles.  Does that seem to line-up?<br/><br/>There were several other suggestions from the original thread that I love.  Changing Fate to Grit/Sanity/Edge works great -- you can start as a Veteran (demi-god) rather than a Rookie (mortal), but you've seen a lot and it's started to get to you.  Divine Favor becomes Support from your Agency.<br/><br/>I also liked the suggestion of Clout to replace Glory.  Since DG is made up of a variety of alphabet-soup agencies, and no one's sure of everyone else's real objectives, I liked the idea of acquired Clout during a mission deciding the final outcome -- with every player character coming to the table with an Agenda that they're supposed to accomplish while also pulling off the mission.  The player who accumulated the most Clout during the mission gets their Agenda -- which probably lines up better with the cooperative/competitive aspects of the game: you still all want to succeed, but you each want something more.  Oaths become Favors between the players ("you owe me one from...") and the Oaths from the Gods become - as noted in the thread - drawing on your experience with the Mythos.<br/><br/>I've been making a list of possible agencies to line up with the Gods listed in the books, as well as Specialties that line up with the Heroic Traits, all of which give some great color as well (are you from the DHS? the FBI?). <br/><br/>All in all, I'm pretty happy with how it's looking -- I'm just wondering if I've gone off the rails anywhere. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>-d-                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/peccable" title="peccable"><img alt="peccable" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/peccable">peccable</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235196/#Comment_235196" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-02T08:15:22+00:00" title="October  2, 2009  8:15AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh.
