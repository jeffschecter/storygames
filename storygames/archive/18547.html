On Friday we created the world, stealing heavily from Early Renaissance Florence with magic akin to _Dresden Files_ mixed with referee advice from _Lamentations of the Flame Princess_ (i.e. magic and wizards exist, but kind of on the down low and not flashy or widespread). We've set the Seriousness dial to "Tongue-in-cheek."[*] Yesterday we had the first session.<br/><br/>The adventure I created is a "request" from the players' patron (the head of a powerful family) to recover an artifact from the ruins of an ancient temple underneath a monastery close to the city. It consists of three chapters: journey to the monastery, inside the monastery, and in the ancient subterranean ruins.<br/><br/>So far they've had 1.5 encounters from the first chapters. First a teenage niece of the patron was following them, and now has made them take her with them. Then they ran into an assassination in progress, which they are planning to prevent; I'm planning for the assassin to reveal that he works for one of the most powerful houses in the city, and therefore interfering will have repercussions. The rest of the adventure, I figure, will involve bandits, finding a way to gain entrance into the monastery's cellar where the passage to the ancient ruins is located, finding a way to keep the Hierarch's agent---also looking for the same artifact---out of their business, and finally retrieving the artifact without triggering the traps protecting it.<br/><br/>I have been re-reading the rules and am getting increasingly uncertain whether Donjon is suited for this type of campaign, even assuming the players will stick to the setting in their facts. Does the system break down when used not so much for bashing hordes of strange monsters and more for intrigue and magical horror, with a judiciously placed aberration from time to time? Does it still work without magical loot, or with magical items that do not give numerical bonuses to fighting abilities?<br/><br/>From the first reading, I very much like the general mechanics, and feel like the Law of Successes is quite brilliant (and so far has inspired my players to add small facts more than Trollbabe's more subtle author stance possibilities did). I am also a fan of Heroquest-like Abilities combined with pool dice. However, even reading some old Donjon-related threads on the Forge, I get a distinct feeling that I should be looking for material in _The Order of the Stick_ rather than poking into history of early modern Florence.<br/><br/>Has anyone successfully run Donjon in settings without pervasive magic? Is there anything I can do to make it work more smoothly?<br/><br/>[*] We picked Tongue-in-cheek as a compromise between "Black humor" or "Serious" that I would want and "Slapstick" that a couple of players seem to gravitate toward, but the description of what Tongue-in-cheek means here still eludes me. I'm not sure I know of these "role-playing cliches" allusions to which the characters should be taking dead-seriously. What does Tongue-in-cheek seriousness level mean to y'all?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_417248">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clinton" title="Clinton"><img alt="Clinton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clinton">Clinton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417248/#Comment_417248" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T18:29:36+00:00" title="June 26, 2013  6:29PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I regret to inform you that what you are doing sounds like an improbable match for Donjon, although stranger things have happened. (As opposed to Stranger Things has happened, which it has not.)<br/><br/>If your players are into it and it's working for you, go for it! Donjon tends to get pretty gonzo, in my experience, so beware of that. Just keep yourself and the players on the same page as regards to tone and it just might work.<br/><br/>Magic items are, as I remember, fairly central to the mechanics, so make sure to tone down encounters a bit if you aren't using them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_417264">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tigranes" title="Tigranes"><img alt="Tigranes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tigranes">Tigranes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/417264/#Comment_417264" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-06-26T23:25:53+00:00" title="June 26, 2013 11:25PM">June 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was actually going to leave a comment earlier today that after browsing the Forge archive some more, I saw a number of people doing space operas and post-apocalyptic settings, so I felt that low-magic Renaissance was not going to be a problem after all. Though, come to think of it, both of those settings allow "magic items" in terms of new technology or newly found old technology, respectively.<br/><br/>We had another session today, and while short, it went smashingly. After the assassin revealed that he works for the Donati family (powerful silk merchants), the players unanimously decided to get involved anyway. We did initiative, the assassin managed to finish garroting his victim by using six successes from a successfully resisted approach from one of the players, but succumbed by the very end of the flurry (literally the last action in the flurry, on player's '1' initiative roll). Midway through combat we collectively decided to simplify the combat by eliminating the separate damage roll, using the Bloody Donjon variant ([Virility + Attack successes + Weapon DR] - [Wherewithal + Armor DR]), which might bite the players in the ass later on.<br/><br/>For the loot roll, one of the players---an inventor---tried to recover a vial of poison on the assassin's body, but it got shattered by the crossbow bolt that killed him (the player's explanation for why he failed). This fits very well with the theme, as does the Bloody Donjon variant, both of them pushing for a more lethal, gritty game. We will see how things go against armored opponents using actual weapons (bandits), but so far I am quite hopeful. If they fight demons, it could very well end up a bit Lovecraftian.<br/><br/>Clinton, as a side note: reading the Creative Commons version of TSOY was my introduction---a couple of years ago---to the Indie RPGs, having only played D&amp;D, Pathfinder, and GURPS beforehand; I have not looked back since. Thank you very much. I also very much admire that you released your games under CC license. I bought Donjon a couple of days ago in large part because it was available under CC.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
