Its become a real nailbiter with less than $3,000 needed in the last three days.<br/><br/>If you are interested, consider pledging. Hellas is a cool RPG which would really benefit with a revamp of its system (despite the Omni system holding up remarkably well after 20 years).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
