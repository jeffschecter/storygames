I've been running a game of 3:16 on Infrno.net for several weeks, and they have mentioned <i>3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars</i> as a recommended game for play on their site. Here's the clipping from their latest newsletter, I wanted to share it with you.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Infrnal <b>Recommendation: 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars</b><br/>\nFrom time to time, we'll recommend roleplaying games that are ideal for use on Infrno, for one reason or another. This newsletter's recommendation is a cool little game known as 3:16 Carnage Amongst the Stars, created by Box Ninja and published by our friends at Cubicle 7.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters are troopers that are part of the 3:16th Expeditionary Force. The premise is simple \u2013 travel to alien planets and wipe out all the dangerous aliens that you find there. Every planet you go to has them and there is lots of carnage.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo why is ideal for Infrno? Here are a few reasons:<br/>\n<br/>\n[ulist]<br/>\n[*]You generate Characters in 5 minutes \u2013 10 tops, only if you've never played before.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe simple, focused premise means that players get the game almost immediately.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt requires less GM prep than most RPG's.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game system is extremely simple, yet has some fun twists.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe book is only $20.<br/>\n<br/>\nDid I mention carnage? And not at the sacrifice of roleplaying.<br/>\n[/ulist]<br/>\n<br/>\nIn short, it's an easy game to get, learn, and play, yet it is satisfying in its execution. It's great for shorter Infrno sessions, or for pick-up games when you're just hanging out in the Chat Lobby!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want to check a game out, check out Donnie Clark's game profile for <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://infrno.net/games/538" rel="nofollow">Abbatoir</a>!<br/>\n<br/>\nIf sci-fi isn't your thing, they are releasing the fantasy-themed Carnage Amongst the Tribes later this year.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nAnyone who is interested in joining the game or just spectating is welcome; <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://infrno.net/games/538" rel="nofollow">Here's the link.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
