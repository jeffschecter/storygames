(Can't remember if I sent this to you or not.)  On page 2 of the thread, Jon describes a huge combat which is, unfortunately, too long to include here.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorcerer's combat is pretty cinematic <i>when you slow down to use the system properly</i>--ironically, it's more exciting the slower it gets.  In Jon's combat, he was hustling for every bonus dice he could find--and as a result, the combat between Nimrote the Hunter and Thak the Four-Armed Albino Primite ended up being a titanic battle of wills as Nimrote was forced to reevaluate his past actions, drawing strength from his sinful pride.  (Later on, he would do just the reverse: try to recant those sins as a way of redeeming his daughter.)  One of the neat little system tricks here is that although it took about 45 minutes to an hour to resolve, by the time it was over everyone was emotionally invested in Nimrote as a character and creatively pumped up to see what would happen to him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108480/#Comment_108480" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-15T20:06:12+00:00" title="November 15, 2007  8:06PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To put some flesh on that - here's what works well in <i>Sorcerer</i> combat scenes:<br/>\n<br/>\n* Use the suggestions in Sorcerer &amp; Sword, and come up with a <i>simple</i> weapons &amp; armor chart.

However, it uses one single unified mechanic.  Basically this:<br/><br/>1) Everyone announces what they want to achieve this exchange be that an attack, a taunt, a distraction, whatever.<br/>2) Everyone rolls dice simultaneously Stamina for physical actions, Will for social/mental ones.<br/>3) Actions are resolved from single highest die to lowest.<br/>4) Targets of an action who have not yet gone have the option of giving up their declared action  or defending with just one die.  If they've already gone or they give up their action they defend with full dice.<br/>5) Those that succeed in their actions can carry their victory dice over into their action on the next exchange.<br/><br/>That's basically it.  ALL actions work that way.  So you taunt your opponent which gives you victory dice on your sudden lunge but he successfully parries which gives him victory dice on his riposte but you counter with a punch to the face which yeilds penalties to him for when you try to kick him to the ground and so on......<br/><br/>What actions chain into what other actions are all in how actions are announced and the logistics of the situation at the end of an exchange.

Or perhaps more accurately, HeroQuest with the chained conflicts from Mystic Russia. Because at default, the simple conflicts are resolved in a single roll, so there's not a whole lot of complexity within a conflict, unless you really play up the augments (using mutliple abilities in a conflict to improve your primary ability) but players can augment each other and with the right abilities, all that flavor you want can be right there. It's all player defined, so no charts. In fact the core rules pretty much fit on a few pages (and if you act now, you can download the Hero's Book players guide for free from drivethru rpg, which has it available for free until the end of the day EST, and pretty much contains all the basic rules you need to play), so it's really simple to learn.<br/><br/>FATE is another good one, as you could encourage what you want with the use of aspects. As in, "I manuever to knock him off his feet, giving him a temporary aspect 'Stumbling'" and then the next player can tag that for a bonus.  You can really promote teamwork and countering and chained attacks, and it's all on the fly so there's no charts to memorize.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108629">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108629/#Comment_108629" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T19:00:59+00:00" title="November 16, 2007  7:00PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 16, 2007 7:01PM by Ry.">edited November 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FATE sounds like it might be more like what I'm looking for, which is bad, because I was leant a copy of Spirit of the Century a while ago and have neither read it nor returned it (because I'm not big on pulp).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_108632">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108632/#Comment_108632" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-16T19:47:13+00:00" title="November 16, 2007  7:47PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite>I'm still not sure about the merits of BW, Sorcerer, Beast Hunter, Riddle of Steel. ...

When a player makes a maneuver against an opponent, she describes tactics, use of environment, passions, cool little details, and so on. The Challenger then evaluates the action and offers a certain number of advantage points. The player can take those and successfully complete the action, or roll the dice for potentially higher gain, but also potentially no gain at all.<br/><br/>Ryan Macklin just talked about how this promotes a certain style of action combat on his <a href="http://masterplan.libsyn.com/" rel="nofollow">Master Plan podcast</a>, Episode 18.<br/><br/>Creative tactics is exactly what I was going for with the game. The narrative counts, dice are a fallback mechanism.

In playtest, the referee's workload was pretty minimal, as I let players create most of their own conflicts, only introducing NPC or environmental conflicts when it seemed necessary to spice things up. It worked out well. But the referee acting as a player (i.e., controlling a single character and having the same rights/controls as all other players)? Uhm. . . I don't know. <br/><br/>I think the best way to <i>try</i> this might be to expand the role of the referee to encompass all other players, rather than trying to eliminate it. That is, treat all players as referees, rather than trying to strip the referee down to being a standard player. Some of the referee privelages really make the game run. Distributing them equally shouldn't stop that but eliminating the altogether probably would. <br/><br/>The only danger I see in this approach is that play will ostensibly be much less ordered, to the point that it might fall apart due to confusion about who has control over what and, subsequently, what kind of 'moves' are allowed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_108795">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/108795/#Comment_108795" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-11-18T21:48:28+00:00" title="November 18, 2007  9:48PM">November 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdrakeh</cite>The only danger I see in this approach is that play will ostensibly be much less ordered, to the point that it might fall apart due to confusion about who has control over what and, subsequently, what kind of 'moves' are allowed.</blockquote>Well, what about a die roll?
