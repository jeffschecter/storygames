I like the idea (basically, if you roll there's consequences, but another PC can intervene to help.)  How can I write this so that it's actually readable?  Any advice is welcome, including anything wrong with the mechanic.<br/><br/>Background: There are 4 stats, ranging 0-5 (Might, Agility, Insight, Will).  Conviction is like any other fast-flying hero point mechanic.  Hit points are something you usually have 5-10 of, like in Red Box Hack.<br/><br/><b>Step 7:  Conflict Begins</b><br/><br/><b>When a character tries to do something important where the outcome of their action is in doubt, a Conflict begins.</b><br/><br/>The GM can simply say \u201croll against X\u201d in which case you roll 1d6 and add the appropriate stat.  X will usually be between 7 and 12.  <b>The GM has the option of naming additional consequences of failure depending on the nature of the action attempted.</b>  This might be the loss of Conviction, loss of hit points, or something entirely in-fiction.<br/><br/>If you state a concrete detail then you get to roll 2d6 instead of 1d6.<br/>If you succeed, your character is successful at what they were trying, and you gain a point of Conviction.<br/>If you fail, the GM must pick one of your stats and reduce it by 1 to a minimum of zero.  You narrate how this happens in the world, including the GM\u2019s additional consequences, if any.  You might say your character is minorly injured, that your character is losing heart, and so on.  This \u201cstat damage\u201d lasts until the end of the session.<br/><br/>When you fail another player can jump in and spend a Conviction point \u2013 if they spend this point they get to narrate the outcome and their character loses a Stat point, a point of Conviction, or a Hit Point.  The player who jumps in has to narrate how their character takes the hit and gets to decide which penalty to take.  In addition, if the action ahd any additional consequences from the GM, the intervening player can retry the action themselves, which would bring on new consequences, or narrate the GM\u2019s consequences and let it go.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_125605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/125605/#Comment_125605" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-10T15:06:09+00:00" title="February 10, 2008  3:06PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan,<br/><br/>This part is confusing.

Say, for example, we have this situation.<br/><br/>The PC's are camping in the wilderness near the lawless port of Bluegravel, and they forget to set a guard. In the middle of the night the GM initiates a conflict where they are woken by the rough hands and gutteral voices of Bluegravel slavers, bundling them into the backs of their catch wagons to sell in the port.<br/><br/>Surely the only sensical outcome of his conflict is "you are taken captive by the slavers" not, you lose 2 damage.<br/><br/>Going back to your original purpose for Camaraderie you want the party all working together against adversity, and winning out despite the odds by helping each other. I think you will hamstring that from the get-go if you have weak and puny adversity. You are giving the players the tools to beat the odds by working together, so don't hesitate to give them really stiff odds to beat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
