I don't want to revist those rants here, but one of the reasonable questions that arose from such is "what could you do to encourage things differently?" (*)<br/><br/>One idea I've been contemplating is more of an incubator approach. Where a design that was past the "hey this is fun" stage and needed the extra effort, and potentially guidance and motivation to get to the "really truly fully baked and done" stage (as opposed to the "not really fully baked but I'm tired of working on it done stage").<br/><br/>The potential of a more patron / grant model to encourage...dare I say...healthier...design habits vs. the game competition model is intriguing to me.<br/><br/>(*) which I why I'm very interested in seeing how JW's revamped Game Chef does or doesn't encourage different design habits than previous incarnations.</blockquote>\nI happen to be a "design what you want, how you want" kind of a guy. Lots of people probably don't <i>want</i> to be encouraged to finish their games. This isn't about them. I'd like to talk about ways to encourage excellence and closure in game design by rewarding it with money. Ralph mentioned the patron / grant model. Microfinancing or investment capital might also be viable models.<br/><br/>Microfinancing is where you elicit small donations into a project. I don't know a ton about it, but what I do know intrigues me. It's essentially eliciting a bunch of investments of a small amount, say $10, to raise a significant amount of money, say $1000 or even $10,000.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235716/#Comment_235716" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T11:56:21+00:00" title="October  5, 2009 11:56AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What about a model where the cost of a print run is loaned/donated/whatever upon completion of a game?

But in the end...really?  Because ultimately if the choice comes down to paying back the guy who loaned you money for your RPG vs. paying the rent and utility bills...we know how that's going to turn out...and people for whom paying regular bills is "no big concern" probably don't need a load for a print run anyway.  So treating it like a loan sounds good in theory but seems more likely to turn ugly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn investment (i.e. taking a claim on profits rather than a fixed payment) carries with it all the baggage of control issues that are just messy.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo a grant approach, perhaps one with a strong social pressure to "pay it foward" seemed the least likely to result in ugliness to me.  I'd kind of love to see some sort of incubator / group mentorship model...kind of like the Forge was back in the day but a bit more focused on the financial side of publication rather than the design theory and basic into to publishing side.   Of course, all of that falls into the category "Sounds good Ralph, go do it" which isn't really feasible for me, at least at this point, which is why I haven't really been talking it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_235745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235745/#Comment_235745" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-05T13:14:16+00:00" title="October  5, 2009  1:14PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 5, 2009 1:16PM by Destriarch.">edited October 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>If someone were to pay me $30,000 a year, that'd be enough.

To make the kind of returns necessary for such a project to be successful you'd have to look at turning out a constant stream of material, including core books and supplements. To put that model into perspective, if we assume an approximate wordcount per book of 200,000, you'd be getting paid 15 cents a word.

I still haven't found a set of incentives that work for me, aside from possibly scheduling playtests which force me to get material together to facilitate play for people.  In that vein, I'd actually suggest a playtesting agreement or something where folks agree to constantly bug the designer about the game until they give them something to play and keep bugging them until it's done.
