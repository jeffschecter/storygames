That's not exactly the goal...<br/><br/><b>Goal #1:</b> To make it plain to everyone that while I am developing a way to play in the world that is cool and good, the stuff others make, and the rules they use, to play in the world are equally awesome.  I want people on the site to generally be, and feel like, <i>peers</i>.<br/><br/><b>Goal #2:</b> Conversions to different sets of rules that work well bring new stuff to the table.  They highlight different things in the game world in new ways, and they are great advertising for <i>both sides of the equation.</i>  I would very much love to put the word out among the SotC community, for example, that a well-done "play this with SotC" write-up will be not only welcomed, but read, applauded, and treated as worthy of thanks from myself...    Because it would be.<br/><br/>...Despite which?  The suggestion has a lot of merit.  I'll think on that.
