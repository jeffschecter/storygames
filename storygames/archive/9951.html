I've noticed that, recently, Your Move has had a much better selection of small press games than Pandys." (Implicit question: Are you gonna try to preserve that / learn from them?)<br/><br/>FLGS GUY: "Yeah, that shelf certainly <i>looked really nice</i>, but it seems like it was the only thing the former manager was really concerned about." (Implicit response: Focusing on indie games, which didn't really bring in the money for Your Move, contributed to the demise of the store.)<br/><br/>ME: "Huh." (Thinking, in my head, that the only reason I didn't spend $100 a month at Your Move is because... I already owned most of the indie games I wanted. And the reason we run SGBoston at Pandys is that Your Move doesn't really have a great atmosphere for playing in the store.  Still, I feel bad that the store that was really invested in supporting indie stuff wasn't better supported by local Boston area indie games fans.  Clearly there could have been a better way to combine our powers like Voltron.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220937">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220937/#Comment_220937" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T08:33:22+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  8:33AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That stuff you thought in your head might have been useful to FLGS GUY if you'd said it out loud.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_220939">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220939/#Comment_220939" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T08:42:49+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  8:42AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's partially why I'm pondering it here (even though I just moved to Seattle).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_220952">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/220952/#Comment_220952" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T09:53:33+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  9:53AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>I already owned most of the indie games I wanted.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>This is something that happens to me, too.

That may not hurt my personal play of Mouse Guard with my local crew or whatever, but, in the long run, the success of indie designer/publishers (aka my peers) is important both to me and to the overall community as a whole, not in a "So Say We All" hivemind sense, but in a reciprocal sense.  If retailers carry indie games and they don't sell well enough to make it worth their while -- then folks like IPR making a push into retail doesn't make any sense at all -- retailers will get some indie games, find they don't sell, and never reorder them.  It gives indie games in general a bad name in retail.<br/><br/>I mean, sure, as Shreyas suggested, and stuff like the Unstore and other recent developments shows, the indie community as a whole is not altogether convinced that pushing into retail is altogether a good thing -- or, at least, that individual publishers should carefully consider the pros and cons before signing on for it -- but that's a nest of complicated issues.

If there's one thing I've learned from dealing with half a dozen local FLGSs, it's that very few of them actually want to <i>sell</i> games in the proactive sense - they're on auto-pilot, ordering in exactly what the other guy is ordering in, and moaning endlessly about people who buy direct or from online retailers. And when I come in to order something:<br/><br/>"Hey, can you order me a copy of [insert semi-popular to popular indie game here]?"<br/>[after checking the database half-assedly] "That's one of those 'weird' games, isn't it? No, we don't carry those."<br/>"Why not?"<br/>"Oh, because nobody buys them."<br/>"But you don't carry them! How do you know nobody buys them?"<br/>[after long, blank stare] "My supplier doesn't carry them."<br/>"But, but, here's a supplier that does!"<br/>"Oh. Um. You can buy from them directly, right? I'll pass, thanks."<br/><br/>Drives me up the freakin' wall. If you won't <b>special order</b> me something, how do you expect to get sales statistics on those products? Are you <i>really</i> doing that much better with your sorry-looking display of old Rifts supplements sitting around waiting for some nostalgic misfit to come in and catch a glimpse of some yellowed cover missing in his collection? How about reading up on some industry news and actually <i>plug</i> that new hawtness to your massive mailing list of fanatical customers?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221709">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221709/#Comment_221709" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T13:41:29+00:00" title="July 30, 2009  1:41PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And run demos.
