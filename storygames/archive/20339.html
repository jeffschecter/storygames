It tells the story of the rise of Prince Argrath, a key figure in the Hero Wars, the conflict that drives much of Glorantha's gaming content (dating back the boardgame White Bear and Red Moon, which was the first expression of the shared world in a game.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.princeofsartar.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.princeofsartar.com/</a><br/><br/>Now part of what any fictional series gives the reader is a guide to what the authors think the world is like. With a web comic that is visual, but it's also about the kind of stories that belong to that world. I mean in the sense that I can tell many kinds of fantasy stories in Middle Earth but certain stories are Tolkienesque, and fiction shows us what those stories are.<br/><br/>Indeed, Robin Laws designed Hero Wars to emulate the fiction of Greg Stafford's unpublished novels, and the extract Morden Defends the Camp was added to the original boxed set to show folks how Greg saw Glorantha.<br/><br/>Fiction set in game worlds is nothing new of course, and in-game fiction to set mood is increasingly common in many game texts. Numenera has significant game fiction, and M.A.R. Barker wrote a number of novels for Tekumel.<br/><br/>Now one opinion might be that game fiction is valuable, because although the Guide to Glorantha might have won the Diana Jones award, not every player is going to read it, but they might read a web comic. But of course the other opinion might be the game fiction stifles the ability of players and GM to own the setting, because it creates more 'authorial intent' that folks may feel constrained by. <br/><br/>So I was curious: how valuable to you is setting fiction?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448294/#Comment_448294" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-31T17:35:41+00:00" title="August 31, 2015  5:35PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Personally, I never read it, but I seem to be in the minority.

It's difficult to bridge that gap of everyone's interest without turning off a player who values sovereignty of the setting. And you can easily have a couple of heavily invested players who find completely different things interesting about the setting. While that sounds good because hey, diverse minds, it can end up creating a weird tension because it's easy for neither player to get quite what they want. When you have very specific expectations, having them boldly flipped can be revelatory or at least a clean, obvious break; but when things are kind of, but just <i>not quite</i> what people wanted, they get that Wrong-Christmas-Present feeling. I've seen people gradually become disinvested in games they thought they wanted for that single reason.<br/><br/>It's a big challenge to do serious justice to established characters and/or an existing plot. Even an earnest attempt at roleplaying a known character will commonly get laughs or at least make people feel odd and distracted. But issues with investment, immersion, and various logistics pop up as you strip away or replace characters and plot from a piece of media.<br/><br/>There are groups who can overcome these issues and there are settings that are more conducive than others. And I've had good games with established settings. But the norm, in my experience, is an unrewarding hassle.<br/><br/>Besides, most settings in media are not particularly original or compelling out of context of the original narrative. For me, there's a difference between, "I would love to visit/live in that world," and, "I would like to play an rpg set there." Probably because other media can be about escapism for me, but rpgs rarely are. But while think <i>that</i> is a good discussion, it veers off-topic and I'll leave it there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448302/#Comment_448302" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-01T09:59:28+00:00" title="September  1, 2015  9:59AM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For heroic and epic games, which is to say a lot of games, there's also the issue of feeling like you're not the protagonists of the setting.

A couple of my friends did read the VtM novels and clan books, one loved most of them and the other can't hear the words "Theather of the Mind" without starting to flame about how VtM larpers influenced and ruined the setting (that's his version and opinion anyway). When directing their respective VtM games, the former uses but a few references to the general notions of the setting and the rest is his own creation. The other only drops references here and there in a humorous way.<br/><br/>In my personal experience, I found something like Aslf describes in the Anima Beyond Fantasy corebook. I used the things I liked and dropped the rest, barely using but three of the main NPCs mentioned.<br/><br/>On another side of things, if the setting reference has been read by everyone on the table, it's easier to convey strong feelings to the players, specially when using NPCs or places that are already charged with emotions. Happened on our Game of Thrones campaign, where my character had a chance to spar with Jaime Lannister, K.O.ed him (sheer luck and some powergaming on my part) and had to courteously apologize his way out. The GM was kind enough to let us toy with the canon to our surprise, and it was a blast for us to be in the setting, be at level with the main characters of the story and even change the course of things. We did the least amount of metagaming possible, but it still felt a bit like we were time travellers changing the past to a point that future events were unfathomable.<br/><br/>On a side note, one of the party members didn't enjoy the game so much because he hadn't read the books nor watched the series, and our GM isn't always kind enough to explain and not even our help is enough to cover all the stuff he's missing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
