Mainly, I change all the classes to go with a more Swords &amp; Sorcery color and I add a few twists to the danger system and to some GM stuff (NPCs, monster powers and adventure preparation). At this moment I am working on a kind of 4 pages oracle game with things from this hack. My plan is to use it to test some of my ideas before I finish the game. I hope to release it soon.<br/><br/>The rest is only notes.<br/><br/>I have a pulp setting hack. The treasure part in the RBH realy inspired me to make something around tomb raiding and relic hunting. But that's a backburner.<br/><br/>I realy want to run Nephilim as a RBH hack. For me, it never was an occult puzzle solving games as the game developped into with french players. I realy want my crazy occult flavored adventure game in France's country side.<br/><br/>I have some vague plans for another noirish oracle game inspired by James Ellroy's L.A. Quartet.<br/><br/>As a note, aside the talents, the conflict system and the combat systems that a lot of people love, there's a thing that always seems to be overlooked in the RBH. It's the way Eric took the two experience source in D&amp;D and redefined them into meaningfull elements. I speak of the treasure and the monster. In each of my hacks, the first thing I think is "do I have good equivalents for the treasure and monster ?"<br/><br/>Let me cite the text :<br/>"Monsters are creatures that do terrible things with terrible consequences. A dragon isn\u2019t necessarily a monster. A dragon that steals the village livestock is a monster, because it\u2019s messing with the livelihood of the villagers."<br/><br/>"THE REAL VALUE OF A TREASURE<br/>Whenever you include a treasure, the players need to know what value it has to the characters around it. Is it an important idol for the local god? Is it a treasured heirloom? Good things or bad things (or both) will happen to people if the adventurers walk off with the treasure."<br/><br/>For me these definitions are the heart of the game : being presented with the opportunities to kill such defined monsters or steal such defined treasures, the characters can be heroes, vile thieves or both. For me the RBH is THE game to play rogue characters like Fafhrd, the Gray Mouser, Kane or Conan despite all the differences of color. That's why I am always a bit disapointed when I read actual play reports. Despite all their awesome (and there's always a lot of awesome in RBH actual play reports), I barely see what I love the most in the game.<br/><br/><br/>Best,<br/>Antoine                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221668">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kiznit" title="kiznit"><img alt="kiznit" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kiznit">kiznit</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221668/#Comment_221668" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-30T12:00:30+00:00" title="July 30, 2009 12:00PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm very interested in hearing more talent ideas for classes pulled back into the Swords &amp; Sorcery milieu, though I love the original RBH talent "wackiness" - especially the lean towards talents that are non-combat oriented but just too cool NOT to take.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
