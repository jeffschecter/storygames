Someone wanted to license Panty Explosion for something last year, but they didn't have a number. They pretty much said "well, how much do you want". Matt and I thought about it for awhile, and then came back with a number that we thought was reasonable. They told us that we were asking way too much, and we never heard from them again.<br/><br/>So I guess it's good to come with an offer. And a plan. I think if I was going to approach someone about their property, I would have an offer and a detailed plan of what I wanted to do with the property. Plus samples of my past work, and sales projections.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127657/#Comment_127657" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T11:31:45+00:00" title="February 19, 2008 11:31AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rafael,<br/><br/>Greg Costikyan cites some figures from the Buck Rogers and Star Wars licenses back in the 80s in <a href="http://www.costik.com/weblog/2003/09/husky-starch-wonderful-world-of-sucky.html" rel="nofollow"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Husky &amp; Starch: The Wonderful World of Sucky Licenses</span></a>.<br/><br/>I can't imagine Serenity or any of the other recent RPG licenses went for anywhere near those figures.

For something "familiar," you're looking into the high tens of thousands to mid hundreds of thousands. For something big, like a movie franchise, it may even get into the millions, and something not well known can go much lower (a nominal $1 is not unheard of for nearly abandoned IP). But it doesn't always make sense.  The short lived TV-show might cost you more than a successful line of horror novels.  Why? Because, in all likelihood, the TV Show is owned by a company that is going to have a minimum bid amount they will work with. A horror novel series rights probably sits with the author, who may actually think RPGs are cool, and will let it go for a fraction AND offer to help write flavor text. Or the author might think RPGs are the devil's spawn and refuse to sell for any amount. Most probably, they are somewhere in between.<br/><br/>But I think the advice of others is best here. Figure out how much you want to spend, and make an offer with your business plan. Either they'll refuse, accept, or want to negotiate. It's hard to give you any other basic guidance than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafael" title="Rafael"><img alt="Rafael" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/sgi.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafael">Rafael</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127711/#Comment_127711" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T13:01:45+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  1:01PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 1:04PM by Rafael.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This thread has surpassed all expectations.

And in general, they said "cool, go do it!".<br/><br/>To be fair, we always aproached them and said up front that it would be a non-profit project. And we had a few people who just ignored us.

It also depends on the size of your publishing operation.  If you're a small guy, building up (like me), paying a royalty rather than an up-front amount might allow you to do a license that you wouldn't be able to do otherwise.  On the other hand, if you're more established, you might be able to take more of a risk with the initial investment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI should also note that, while I've dealt with three licensed rpgs at this point, I'm definitely not an expert.  I'm just learning as I go.

I think enabling folks to take on larger licenses is very important, but it depends on the intent of the license.  If you're trying to attract an existing fanbase so you can sell more copies, that could be cool.  But you could also license a little-known piece of work because you really like it and will be pretty much be given free reign (which might not happen with larger licenses).  Your work on Urchin embodies that latter tactic more, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127766">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127766/#Comment_127766" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T14:16:09+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  2:16PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 19, 2008 2:16PM by Clint Krause.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Absolutely.  <br/>\n<br/>\nIdeally, a license can provide both a chance to play in someone else's sandbox and a chance to add their fan community to yours.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127804/#Comment_127804" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T15:59:37+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  3:59PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think there's an extra layer that needs to be considered here as well, and that's recovery of cost and additional up front expenses to recover costs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost indie games are published with fairly minimal investment.  It doesn't take that many sales to recoup that minimal investment. However, if you're going to up the investment with a licensing fee (even a fairly modest one will probably hit low to mid 4 figures if its a profitable property) the "usual" number of indie sales ain't going to cut it.  That means you're going to need to sell more copies...and that means additional publishing expenses beyond what is typical for an indie game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn other words if you're going to dish out any kind of bank for a license you're going to have to "take it to the next level" in terms of production values and distribution plan in order to recover that cost...and then you'll have THAT cost to recover as well.  So from where I'm sitting, unless you're talking a license that's only gonna run you $200 from a couple of guys with an unheard of web comic, having a licensed product means the business side of publishing just got a whole lot bigger (either that or it becomes a true vanity press).<br/>\n<br/>\nSo the true cost of the license is not just the cost of the license...its the cost of the license PLUS the cost of all the extra stuff you'll have to do to make having purchased the license worth while.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127806">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127806/#Comment_127806" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T16:08:59+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  4:08PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experience in licensing is largely with the major media companies, but not entirely.<br>\n<br>\nBasically speaking, there is a phycological entry barrier in the minds of the folks at CBS, Paramount, etc where if you have not proposed a guarantee of at least that much, they won't talk to you. That magical number is $10,000. Now, its not "impossible" to begin talks with a lower number, but man, you better be charismatic or have an inside connection. lol.<br>\n<br>\nFew things you have to consider with licensing. In the licensing industry there are a few common terms.<br>\n<br>\n1) Advance<br/>\nThe advance is how much money you offer up front, on signing of the contract.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Guarantee<br/>\nThe guarantee is how much money you guarantee to pay over the course of the license, sometimes broken down by year or quarter.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) Royalties<br/>\nRoyalties are the percentage of the action you give on the sales of whatever you are licensing. Usually your "advance" is an advance against the royalties. So, if you offer 10% of gross income on the license and you put an "advance" in of $10,000, then you would owe nothing more until you had grossed $100,000 in revenues on the license. After that you would owe the 10% of anything above and beyond that. Royalties can be based on a number of things, from gross revenue, gross profits, net profits, and pre and post tax net profits. For simplicity's sake, on small licenses such as what our industry typically represents, they tend to like royalties on simple gross, because that is the easiest to audit, should they deem that neccesary. As yes, most any licensor with a clue with expect the right to audit you. Some expect the right to audit you &gt;at your expensealways&lt; demand world wide rights. language rights. Production rights. You will want to clearly define what rights you have to produce things. One might assume for a role playing game license that as the licensee you would want the right to product any number of books and accessories under that line, but if its not clearly define in the license that you have that right, the licensor might simply claim you had the right to produce just one item and suddenly after making the core rules, you find you need to buy "another" license to produce more.<br/>\n<br/>\n6) Approvals<br/>\nThere is almost always an approval process. The licensor wants to see your product to make sure its not going to be full of child porn or whatever. Some of them may even try and demand to see a finished product for approval. Which, of course, for something like toys that require plastic injection molding, ert, would be a real bitch if they saw the finished product and then wanted you to make changes. So best to head that kind of thing off at the pass and submit the form of pre published formatted material you will make materials available for the approval process. Scott Palter, the king of game industry licensing, once told me to also be careful to include a time lapsed clause. That means, after a reasonable amount of time after having submitted material for approval, if they have not approved it, time elapsed on the contract duration ceases until they do. So if 10 working days is what the contract says and they been sitting on it for 30 days, your license duration just got extended 20 days. The Guild walked away from a license deal for Battlestar Galatica back around 2000 because Universal would not agree to such a clause. But without such a clause, the licensor could in theory take your guarantee money, then sit on your submitted materials and never approve a thing until your license runs out. Unscrupulous licensors sometimes go into a licensing arrangement with newbies with exactly that in mind. Take the money and preserve the property until a higher profile licensee comes along.<br/>\n<br/>\n---<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother thing yu have to determine is, who is handling the licensing. If a company has a dedicated licensing team, as most major movie and tv studios do, they are going to tend to require higher advances and higher guarantees, because licensing royalty is their only revenue stream to justify their job and their department and their bosses put pressure on them not to accept small offers. Even if  a small offer is the only thing that makes sense for the proposed product format and its intended markets. They are afraid any licenses with low advances or low guarantees with devalue the IP in the eyes of the potential licensees from the larger industries that really should be paying the bigger bucks.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf its a smaller company, sometimes they use designated license represenative who work on commission. The Guild once put in a proposal for RPG and board game rights to the tv show Reboot. We talked with the studio who did the show and they were very interested and they seemed ok with our proposed advance and guarantee as well. But then they handed us off to their licensing rep, who was working on a 10% commission. The $3K advance we had offered didn't particularly interest her because that would have only been an initial $300 in her pocket, so she found ways to delay the process, not return phone calls, etc. From my experience dedicated licensing reps are simply harder to deal with on smaller licenses because of their small take for closing the deal.<br/>\n<br/>\nBook authors and their agents seem like the easiest folks to deal with. Though be fowarned, any license to an IP where the creator is overly protective of "their vision" may make for a bad license as well and bloody hell at the approval process. Because some creators simply can't get passed anyone trying to introduce anything into their playground. Understandable, but they probably shouldn't be selling licenses to products such as RPGs, which essentially require that playground to be expanded, both by the publisher and ultimately by the players. Back before Green Ronin snagged the Black Company license, we had discussed RPG and Board Game rights to the Black Company, but the authors refusal to let us to a map for that fictional setting kind of ruined that possibility. I mean, a board game with a map is rather hamstrung. lol.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are going to license anything, it is absolutely best to make sure your vision for the products matches the IP holders vision for the product _before_ moving forward with the license. Sometimes an IP holder has no clue whatsoever what your proposed product would be, so you may need to take some time to educate them about the product and your market.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd its always better to walk away from a potentially bad license than to press forward because you just really want to work with that IP. Make sure the license fits your goals. If not, walk away. Find another playground to play in.<br/>\n<br/>\nRyan S.
