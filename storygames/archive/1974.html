<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Melinglor</cite>2) I don't understand voluntarily doing boring stuff. OK, that's subjective as hell, but what I mean is fiddling around with describing and adjudicating really unimportant things that don't get us where we all want to go in the game. Not "roll to cross the street," but damn close sometimes.</blockquote>
Disclaimer before I begin: If I describe something you like as "boring," I am not attacking you or your fun. I am simply stating a fact: that it is something that <i>I</i> find boring. But! I'm not saying, "If you disagree, please shut up," rather I'm asking, "I'd really like to understand where this is coming from, so your perspective is valued." So anyway. . .<br/><br/>I'm going to lead with some play examples. I'll just go ahead and use real names for continuity and clarity; it's not like you know these people, anyway.<br/><br/>1) GMing Over the Edge, two players, Ben and Steve, had their characters meet, and the Ben's, an assassin, asked the Steve's, a chemist, about getting some poison to coat his crossbow bolts. Which is exactly what I was thinking of when I framed the scene, particularly from the standpoint of weaving characters' plotlines into each other as much as possible (pretty important in a "wander around the city game" liek OtE). What I <i>didn't</i> expect was for Ben and Steve to sit around and discus in character all the different poisons they could use and their various effects, for like 20 minutes. other players were appalled/disdainful of the fact that they were discussing horrific killing and torture techniques around a public tavern table. I was more concerned with the mind-crushing boredom; I'd picured more of a "Oh, you're a chemist? I'd like some poison." "Sure, come by the lab and I'll hook you up." sort of exchange. Instead I got this meticulous amateur chemistry lesson. Boring.<br/><br/>2a) Playing a fantasy campaign in Big Eyes Small Mouth, GMed by Colleen: Ben's character, just introduced to the game and bereft of gear, wants to use his woodshaping power to pull a bow from a tree. Argument ensues over whether he can really pull a recurve bow from the wood, sans the normal process for crafting the bow and curving the wood. Note that this is not (f'rinstance) D&amp;D, where such an ability would have specifically defined parameters; this is BESM, and the ability is basically "do whatever you want within rough guidelines, involving wood." But whether he can really create <i>this exact kind of bow</i> (one which would basically be free in character creation) under the present (non-crisis) circumstances, is hotly contested (mostly by players Joe and Mark, IIRC) for 20-30 minutes. Boring.<br/><br/>2b) In the same scene, my brother Anthony asks Colleen if his character is in the presence of an NPC to talk to him/her. This while all the characters are all at the same general location (a hillside beside a starship wreck), milling about in aimless downtime. I snarked at this one. "You know what <i>I</i> do when I want to be next to [so-and-so]? I say, 'I'm next to [so-and-so]." My other bro Matt (who I've tried to talk hippie-theory to and encountered much resistance) says, "hey, don't start <i>that</i>, Joel." I lapse into silence. the scene continues, with Colleen granting Anthony <i>permission to have a conversation</i>. A conversation that could've been <i>had</i> in the time it took to negotiate it. Boring.<br/><br/>3) D&amp;D, Joe GMing. We explored a significant quantity of a dungeon and encountering very, very little opposition (no fight lasting 2 full rounds, and that even with half the players absent), meaning lots and lots of "I burst into the room, Arcane Magicks at the ready!" "OK, you find an old desk with empty drawers, and shelves of dusty scrolls. . ." Anyway, we found a doohicky in an altar that transported us back in time, and we're making camp for the first night in a wholly unknown wilderness area, unsure of what awaits us in this new place and time. Joe asks Cranston (playing a ranger) and me (a Warmage with cross-class survival skill trained up) to make Survival checks. Cranston rolls well, I think; Joe described how he procured food for everyone. I rolled exceptionally well--an 18, for a total of 24. Which I'm thinking, with my luck will be my best roll of the session. Joe describes how 'm building a lean-to shelter for the group. But a really <i>nice</i> lean-to shelter. I don't know what I <i>expected,</i> exactly, but I'm all digging on the danger and uncertainty of our predicament and expecting danger at every turn, really psyched that my survival skill will help us y'know, <i>survive</i>, like finding our way to something interesting or useful, or defending ourselves from dangerous predators, or something. But no, we pass the night in peace, then next day get railroaded to the town we were obviously "supposed" to arrave at for the next part of the story. So the survival rolls meant exactly zilch. Boring.<br/><br/>4) OtE again. Colleen's character is in the airport on an errand of importance and passes by Matt's character having lunch with his mother in a cafe. This was purely a meta-level character weaving on all our parts: hey, what if she runs into him here? Let's see what happens!" Colleen was even the one who framed Matt's char to the airport, as she's playing his mother. Anyway, after I narrate: "You see Kyle in a cafe having lunch with his mother," Colleen asked, "hoe close am I to him? Am I right next to him? Can I reach him?" I was floored. It was all I could do to maintain my composure. I just answered, "hey, you're as close as you want to be." We proceeded with the scene, which went OK. I was just shocked that she would ask me something like that. It wasn't combat, and there are no movement rate, tactical positioning mechanics in OtE. Just a social scene. Why bog it down with little niggling concerns of who's-where-and-what's-what? Does it grant any real tactical advantage? Does it help anyone imagine the world in greater clarity? Does it affect the interaction of the characters? In all cases I'd say no. . .so what's the point of worrying over this stuff? It's boring.<br/><br/>(cont)                </div>

                            Damn, this is long. Apologies. I can only hope it's coherent.<br/><br/>5) OtE once more, Joe and Travis had their characters make friends, then made plans to meet for breakfast the next day and explore the city together. Well, Travis couldn't make it next session, so I figured, rather than make Joe sit and watch all night while I ran everyone else's scenes, i'll move things along without Travis. So I'm like, "You go out to meet him for breakfast and he doesn't show." I'm thinking, he'll either go looking for the guy, and find out he's on the run from fanatical cultists or something, or he'll at least go about his day on his own, and we won't wast the opportunity to play. Well, he was like, "I wait until <i>noon</i>" (It was a <i>breakfast</i> date!) "Then I check at his hotel." When he learns that the other char left the hotel around breakfast time, he decides to &gt;ahem&lt; <i>go back to his hotel room and do paperwork</i>. That's it. "Aren't you going to go look for your friend?" "I did; I asked at his hotel." That's <i>it</i>?! His character's a <i>detective, even</i>! I complained to other players (Colleen and Matt) but they backed him up: "He's just playing his character." Apparently to the point of utter inaction. They guy's supposed to be OCD, so I guess the idea is that he can't easily deviate from a plan, and thus turtles up if things fall through. Matt's agreed with me in the past, that a character geared for inaction suffers froma design flaw; Steve's chemist was like this. But in this case he didn't think I could fairly accuse Joe of turtling since it was just one isolated incident. I think, however, that the multiple appearance of Joe's name in this series of examples lends some credence to attributing to him a style of play I would call: boring.<br/><br/>OK. So what's up with this trend? These are of course my own personal gaming buddies; is such a mindset common? Why so much emphasis on all these little details? I mean, they're <i>chronic</i> with us. This seems clearly to be feeding into the 20 minutes of fun in 4 hours" effect, which we definitely experience often. I don't think people actually <i>want boredom</i>. . .but what other explanation is there? When I talked to some of my OtE players about scene framing, and called it "skipping to the good stuff," Ben walked over and gave me a big bear hug. Yet he's one culprit in the poison-discussion in (1). In (2) he was the <i>victim</i> of detail-fussiness. But he regularly engages in this detail-mongering, especially in my OtE game: "OK, so I get up and dress and strap on all my gear, and I go to breakfast at this place, and I go to the liquor store and buy another bottle of Coffee Liquer. . ." (all just like he described for the <i>previous</i> day, mind).<br/><br/>So what's going on? I find all this dry dead dull boring. I mean, rules disputes, I can kind of understand; it's not like (most) people go <i>into</i> it thinking, "I would love to stall the game while we argue a rule for half an hour"; presumably people are arguing with a <i>purpose</i>, whether consistency, "balance," or personal advantage. But THIS stuff. . .why?? I'd reallylike to hear diagnoses of this <i>as</i> a problem, as well as defenses of it as a valid mindset for gaming. Consider me mor ebewildered than criticizing, here (frustrated and ranty, sure, but still bewildered).<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>

                            Can't really comment on the examples because I wasn't there; most snippets of roleplaying come out as boring since you're missing the framework where they happened. I'll offer a counter example which you'll probably find boring, but I found it to be awesome.<br/><br/>We we're starting a mini-campaign/oneshot with a Twin Peak-ish theme. I had four players; I had prepared backgrounds for them - just scracthed five different notes about them, and picked up one thing they were really good at. All characters were FBI-agents.<br/><br/>We went through initial briefing and gathering equipment quite fast; the characters hopped into car and started driving towards this little town in New England. On the way, they decided that it was time for late-breakfast, stopped by a roadside cafeteria. And spent two hours having the breakfast, going into details of who orders what, how they eat, and discussing the mission.<br/><br/>Why? I think they wanted to establish the characters by exploring them and interacting with them. Coming up with details based on and expanding the very brief notes they had, both established the characters as full-fledged (and very archetype, in FBI/Twin Peaks -sense) persons both for themselves and other players. Upon leaving the cafeteria, they knew whom they were and whom the other characters were. Aside from that, they pretty much established the theme and tone of the game, which I then played along, as the GM.<br/><br/>So, I think some of your examples could have something to do with simulation; players want their characters to interact with the enviroment and other characters, in order get a better image of who they are, where they are and who are these other people. Could be and probably is a lot other stuff as well. That just jumped out for me.                        </div>

                            Joel, in reading your examples I'm seeing CA-crash after CA-crash after CA-crash.  I'm also not seeing any player-flagging techniques being used, which would obscure that problem.  You, rather obviously, want some tightly-constructed, hard-hitting Story Now awesomeness.  Some of your friends seem, as Jukka suggests, are looking for some more loosely-constructed character-exploring simulationism.  There also seems to be some social group power dynamics (displaying mastery of bow-making techniques, GM/player "where am I standing" stuff) expressing in less than pleasant ways.<br/><br/>The short form of it all is that I see a group of players, each trying to fulfill their own, divergent interests in a group environment without ever expressing what those interests are in anything but indirect means.  This means that 99% of the time, the content of play is engaging for one player but "boring" for the others.<br/><br/>Now, before I go on to "what to do about it," I really feel I need to say: this may not be something that can be fixed.  You and your friends may have unreconcilable differences in interests such that they cannot all be satisfied with a single solution.  In order to enjoy the non-boring play you want, you may need to find a new group (which may or may not include one or two members of your current group).  That doesn't mean that you don't hang out with these friends, or even that you stop playing RPGs with them, but you may need to look for your preferred style of play somewhere else.<br/><br/>I would suggest to you that, in order to begin to fix your problem, you first need to get a good handle on what your friends' interests are.  One-shots of fringey games can be good tools for doing this.  Playing the Pool or Conquer the Horizon or Lacuna, and playing it consciously to see what your friends do in the sometimes vastly different circumstances, can be eye-opening.  It can also be eye-opening for everybody else: if you introduce one such game and explicitly point out things like "because there's no GM, you get to say where your guy is without asking anybody else," it can show them that a game can still function without that GM/player power structure.<br/><br/>Then talk about it.  Talk to people singly, talk to them in a group.  Get them talking about what they like and what they don't like, what they liked about the one-shots and what they didn't like about them, and so on.  That you better understand what they want is good; that <em>they</em> better understand what they want is fantastic.<br/><br/>Then in the far-flung future, you may try alternating games, for instance, so that there's a sim-heavy get-into-details game and a heavy-hitting story now game running, just trading off times.  "Roleplaying" can still be something that your group of friends does together, just with a more explicit understanding of why you do it together and how you can all collectively scratch each other's itches.                        </div>

                            Because I don't believe the current defined Creative Agendas are helpful, it's no surprise I don't see those as "CA-crash"es at all. Most of what I see there is just a miscommunication about what level of focus you want in the game. Your lean-to Survival check is a great example.  The GM was thinking, "yeah, this guy's made a great roll, I need to give a bunch of detail about how he is responsible for the group having good shelter that night and making their stay comfortable and safe." You were thinking "what the fuck, who cares where we sleep, let's get to the fighting" (or whatever). That's not a disagreement about goals, that's a disagreement about pacing. Technique level, if you believe in that stuff.                        </div>

                            details are probably the most important part of role playing for me. <br/><br/>I like them because they capture the mystery and magic of daily life and the everydayness of the mysterious and magical better than the most sharply defined conflict. Details, more than names or motivations or powers in the game system, make characters memorable. They bring out the thingness of things and the dreamworthiness of setting. <br/><br/>Because details can make everything in a game glow in the dark, sometimes they should be used in moderation. I think we need more techniques and systems that figure out when and how to zoom in or out.                        </div>

Jason, seriously, I love having you here but sometimes you make me want to scream and hit things.  CA conflicts <em>are</em> miscommunications about what level of focus you want in a game.  That's like, the whole idea. We're saying the same thing with different words.                        </div>

                            That is certainly not what a CA clash is. Story Now is a fundamentally different thing than Step On Up. It is one thousand percent NOT a level of focus question. At least as far as I understand the essays.  You can have a Step On Up game where such a degree of granularity is totally unnecessary and gets in the way - you can have one where that's all that matters about the game. You can have a Story Now game where such a degree of granularity is totally unnecessary and gets in the way - you can have one where that's all that matters about the game.                        </div>

                            But more broadly--and setting CA and all that GNS talk aside--what's being discussed is people's priorities about the gaming: what do you come to the table to do?  And it sounds like what Joel is saying is, "Dang, these guys come to the table wanting to do stuff that I find boring."  (Which, if I understand it, is basically what CA means.)<br/>
<br/>
JD, you might be right and it's an issue of technique and scale, but it looks like it repeats a LOT with this group, which to me suggests it's about why they game, rather than how.                        </div>

                            It's possible - although you have to take into account the almost completely busted advice on how to zoom in or zoom out in games. It's possible these folks are playing the way they're playing simply because that's how they've been instructed to play, that's how they think it's "right". Another view is that they're all playing the same way, but they're all interested in different content.  Possibly some combination of these as well.<br>
<br>
I'm going to go into greater detail on the examples now. <br/>
<br/>
1.  The Case Of The Chemistry Lesson.  It's my impression that Ben and Steve were having a grand old time showing off their real-life chemistry knowledge (I have OTE - I know that junk's not in the books) and the other players were having a grand old time reacting to their discussion in-character. "'Good heavens, these gentlemen are uncouth!' My monocole pops out in surprise!" Whereas Mel seemed to wish for a quick scene establishing a relationship and moving on, Ben and Steve saw the relationship-establishing as being something worth exploring for whatever reason. ("My guy wouldn't trust this dude if he didn't know what he was talking about..." is one possibility, another is, "what's the rush, man, this in-character talk is fun and we're getting into it!"  There's a million more.)  Another view: Ben and Steve are pushing for immersion here, using their real-life knowledge to enhance their belief in the crazy world their characters find themselves in, and the other players are too, through their appalled reactions to the in-character inappropriateness of it all. Mel, by contrast, could really care less about whether Ben and Steve feel that the world or their characters are real at all, he wants to keep the action moving.  So there's all sorts of possible things going on here.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Lean-Tos of the Rich And Adventuresome. As I mentioned above, there's a lot of unanswered questions about what the DM's plans were with this that makes it hard to evaluate. Again we have Mel wanting to get to the chase, but again we have someone who sees a different detail as one that's worth going into. I would think that the reason one would want to describe a really comfortable campsite was because the alternative was a harsh night with rocks digging into your backs. Since that didn't happen, we don't know what kind of alternative the DM had prepared. For the most part in D&amp;D explorations, the DM is setting the stakes, and often, like here, it's set opaquely. One way for Joe to address this issue is to make it clear what each die check is for, particularly for skills like Survival. There is some tradition of "roll the dice and then I'll tell you what I rolled for", but in D&amp;D3 the only time that's suggested is for perception rolls and I've had great success in saying "if you make it, X, if you miss it, Y". Mel, let's take a counterfactual for a moment. Say that Joe had said: "Here's the deal, gang. You're in unfamiliar territory. You don't even know what year or season it is. There are dangers in this area - they don't know you're there but it's getting late and you need to make camp soon. The question on the table is - are you going to be able to make camp in such a way that the evening is restful and peaceful...or will you be disturbed in the night either by a dangerous situation or just plain rocks-in-the-back? It's going to be a Survival check, if you have it, you can help someone else with the aid another rules...who's going to be the one taking the responsibility for this?"  Would that have changed your experience/boredom level? Or is Survival junk just inherently boring unless there's some known physical danger on the line?                        </br></br></div>

                            2a - Whoso Draws This Bow From This Tree Is Rightwise Born King Of BESM. Arguments over character capability can mean a whole hell of a lot of different things. This one is going to be hard to pull up the nails on and figure out what is underneath. It can mean that the other players did not think the power was going to be that versatile and they would have picked more versatile powers if they had known, it can mean that the other players perceive their spotlight time as being in jeopardy, it can mean that the other players just plain don't think that PLAYER should have access to an ability of that versatility, and so on. This is how the "GM is god/final arbiter/blah blah blah" thing got started, to make it clear where the buck stops - without some ability to do that, it could be a game killer.  This one is SUPER HARD to deal with but the only way I've ever seen it work with everyone being happy is to take a step back either in the moment, or afterwards, and say "why did you think that was so important" to both sides. Once you have that nailed down, you know what kind of solution to apply, and not before. Stopping the buck is not going to actually stop the conflict. There will always be some other power to argue about.<br/>
<br/>
I've struggled with this one myself - I don't see it as boring so much as frightening. The whole game can teeter on a comma. It sucks. More thoughts from others would be good on this.<br/>
<br/>
2b and 4) "Hey, can I go over to this guy and talk? Can he hear me now? Good. Can he hear me now? Good."  Two things that I've found are at the root of this. One I have to say really loud:<br/>
<br/>
Ahem.<br/>
<br/>
YES, IT DOES HELP SOME PEOPLE TO IMAGINE THE SITUATION IF THEY GET A CLEAR, SPATIAL PICTURE OF WHO IS WHERE AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING - THEY NEED IT OR ELSE THEY CAN'T GRASP WHAT'S HAPPENING.<br/>
<br/>
Two: There's been quite a number of times where a player has spoken up to say "I want to talk to Billy" when Billy has just been described as leaving the room, teleporting to another dimension, or being brutally murdered.  Sometimes people just miss things in GM description. It's nobody's fault. It just happens. Hell, I have a hard-of-hearing player. She asks me stuff like "is he here to talk to?" all the time because she can't always follow what I'm saying when I get excited and talking fast.  Bottom line: Colleen may have learned that behavior from games in which she's tried to contribute and got shot down either gently or hard.                        </div>

                            5) The Case Of the Turtling Detective. You've made a great identification of turtling behavior and some of the things that can contribute to it. It might be connected, yes, to some of the stuff listed above (but not necessarily, as you can see there's a lot of possibilities up there). I would say that the thing that would loom largest in my head as a possible factor in this is that you used a real-world fact (Travis didn't show) to contribute to an in-character adventure hook (find Travis' character). That is a pretty outre' thing to do for a lot of people who are highly committed to group play and group relationships. How explicit did you make it to the group that this is what you were doing? "Hey guys, Travis couldn't make it this week, I thought it would be a cool thing to do to base an adventure hook off Joe's character looking for him when he doesn't show up in the game world - what do you think?" sounds a lot different to my ears than "You show up for breakfast and he's not there..."                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matt Wilson</cite>That kind of play you're describing gives me a rash. Or maybe I got that from Andy. </blockquote>
Hmm. Maybe I should stop rubbing my PTA book all over my body.<br/><br/>Ahem.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Jason, there's really no need to remind us all that you don't buy into CA stuff. I think we get it by now. it's especially unhelpful to bring up when it leads to statements like:
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Technique level, if you believe in that stuff.</blockquote>
I mean, are you really saying you're skeptical/agnostic about the existence of <i>Techniques</i>? Come <i>on.</i><br/><br/>That said, your enumerated commentaries (and with titles that make me laugh!) on my little collection of gripes I <i>did</i> find helpful, so I'll respond to those.<br/><br/>1) First an aside: it wasn't actually so much real-world  chemistry stuff, so much as punnish acronyms assembled from the Periodic by Steve. Like MoO, a truth serum that renders you incapable of lying, 'cept you can only say "Moo" anyway. But that's not the main issue. This is: it's my assessment that the core cause of the behavior is simply the assumption that you've "gotta talk it out," as in "that's what roleplaying is." Skipping (i.e. scene framing) or summarizing would be a kind of cheating. This "rule" seems to apply specially to conversation. Summarizing a cab ride, skipping bathroom breaks, and a million other bits and pieces, never causes any sort of row. And incidentally, RE the others' reactions, I did not misspeak when I said the <i>players</i> were appalled/disdainful. They went ahead and roleplayed the characters' reactions as they saw fit, but it was definite player disapproval at work, which I claim based both on their attitudes at the time and subsequent conversation with both of them. The feeling (with which I tend to agree) was that it was a pretty inhuman, non-real-person thing to do. Which reminds me, I've got a good long rant in me some time about how my player group at large approaches OtE like a bog-standard D&amp;D campaign. I'll just say for now that the Glorious Lords are Orcs, and leave the rest as an exercise for the reader.<br/><br/>2a) In this case I'd say it was definitely dick-waving over archery/bowcraft knowledge. Ben's argument was that he was basically pulling a bow that was equivalent to a recurve bow in stats, without it being subjected to the recurve process. Which of course was <i>preposterous</i>, the treating process is what gives the bow its spring, yadda yadda. I was struck by how dedicated they were to arguing over the <i>realism</i> of a power that can <i>pull a bow from a tree trunk.</i><br/><br/>Good observationon the "buck stops here" phenomenon. I'llhave toremember that simple question ; I wonder what effect it would have on the next pissing match if Iwere to come right out and ask it.
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>I've struggled with this one myself - I don't see it as boring so much as frightening. The whole game can teeter on a comma. It sucks. More thoughts from others would be good on this.</blockquote>
Yeah, it is, isn't it? Especially when "D&amp;D-ownership" is involved; we have several competing camps for that. (Joe and Mark are one, and another player, Adam, is kind of an insurgent force. I've noticed Adam never hands you his book when you ask toborrow it; he always asks you what rule/section your loking for, and <i>reads the whole thing aloud to you.</i>)<br/><br/>3) Answer: yes it would have made a great deal of difference if Joe had put things that way. I still may not have been totally jazzed, but I sure wouldn't feel the awful deflation I did feel when my l33t superawesome roll turned out to do nothing. And it would help if something, <i>anything</i>, would attackus on watch sometime. Nothing ever does, and I keep wondering why we're even assigning watch at all.<br/><br/>2b) and 4) <blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>YES, IT DOES HELP SOME PEOPLE TO IMAGINE THE SITUATION IF THEY GET A CLEAR, SPATIAL PICTURE OF WHO IS WHERE AND WHAT THEY ARE DOING - THEY NEED IT OR ELSE THEY CAN'T GRASP WHAT'S HAPPENING.</blockquote>
OK, I &gt;ears ringing&lt; hear you. I do understand this concern. Actually, Colleen and I frequently run into problems because her idea of things is crystal clear in her mind but mine's way off, so I keep trying to do thigs that don't work becayse of the shape of the building or something.  She refuses to use maps or minatures, even for D&amp;D (too distracting), so I'm often left feeling the fool. I wonder if she feels the same about mine. I personally feel that we should <i>either</i> use up-front visual aids, OR we should throw out worrying about spatial relationships at all. Instead we've got both--"just imagine it in your head. . .but better imagine it right!" 
<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Two: There's been quite a number of times where a player has spoken up to say "I want to talk to Billy" when Billy has just been described as leaving the room, teleporting to another dimension, or being brutally murdered.</blockquote>
OK, I really do get this one. I've so been that guy. I suck at keeping track of that stuff, and I'm always feeling stupid when I bungle my chance to talk to so-and-so. But I don't think that really applies in the above cases. In the former case everyone was standing about on the same hillside, with acton at a standstill. And in the second, I had given clear information, just right for OtE I think.There's something else going on here, I think. Maybe just an attempt to help themselves imagine the situation via a "clear, spatial picture." I just wonder if it's really worth nickel'n'diming ame time away with such concerns.<br/><br/>I think it definitely is rooted in "who gets to do what." Like, the GM "runs the world," which means the GM tells you where you are, what's around you,whatever. When I first tried scene framing techniques with my group, I asked everyone what they'd like to do for the session; Colleen had a tonof NPCs she wanted to go see. Iasked her to pick the favorite meeting and we'd do that. She couldn't. She was like, I don't know, you're the GM." Her reasoning was, "I don't know if you have anything planned for the NPCs that I don't know about. Which, y'know, could happen, but even if it did we could still proceed with an <i>attempted</i> meeting or something, or just said "OK, pick your second favorite." But the whole idea of doing "what GMs do," while a player, was way off the radar.<br/><br/>5) OK,I didn't exactly give a "forward, to adventuuuure!" speech, but I thought I made the situation pretty clear: "OK, it looks like Travis isn't gonna be here, so how 'bout this: you go to breakfast and he doesn't show." I guess that could be interpreted as "he doesn't show, I go home, the end," but I rather assumed that a person who comes to play would rather do something than nothing. And I mean, the character's a detective. Joe was perfectly content to hang ou, joke around watch that session, coming at it from a perspective that sometimes a personjust isn't going to have anything todo (we have a very large group). My feeling is, that's fine only I was jumping up and down and waving a big flag that said "something to do," and he ignored it. Which makes ME feel kind of slighted for having put out the effort.<br/><br/>So anyway, there's that. It's way too late (early) for me to try to draw any conclusions,but that should be good conversation-fodder.<br/><br/>Good night.<br/><br/>-Joel                        </div>

                            1) Hm, interesting, thanks for the clarification. Well, the same principles are true. You had one subset of players that thought the conversation was something that playing out would be awesome/hilarious and another subset that thought it was dumb. First, you have to consider the possibility that this doesn't mean much of anything at all. Gaming has elements of improv acting in it and improv is hard to do well. Not everything you do is going to knock everyone's socks off and it has nothing to do with game selection or play style. It may just be that the conversationalists thought it was going to be cool/hilarious/insightful and it turned out not to be. Hell, if someone is bad at improvving, MOST of what they do might be lame and they're just getting off on the adrenaline rush of performance. There are other possibilities too.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of which possibility is the correct one, the only feedback Ben and Steve are getting "in the moment" are the in-character reactions of the other players which, since they are in-character, are ALWAYS going to be seen as positive reactions, even if they are appalled/disdainful/etc. After all, they are committing to the improv. Fostering an atmosphere in which you can give negative feedback is extremely difficult for a leisure time activity. They have to be committed to improving their play, like a chessplayer. The first few times you put the question of specific feedback (as in, "what did you guys think of the scene with the three dogs and the long underwear? Funny or lame?") everyone is going to say positive things just because they don't want to jeopardize the group. You have to get people comfortable with negative feedback before they're willing to listen to it. Some are confident enough that they are immediately comfortable with it, others not so. It's a tough call.<br/>
<br/>
2b &amp; 4) First, the reactive player thing is just a preference like anything else. My wife loves roleplaying but hates any contribution that is outside her character. "If I wanted to do that, I'd GM. I don't want to do that. Stop asking me to do that. If the game requires me to do that, I will bow out and the rest of you can play." is her firm response. So there's a chance that at bottom, Colleen may just not like to scene frame, period. I've been able to sneak some scene framing in a little bit just by really obviously and explicitly going with their expressed preference. For example, I've gotten some good response from doing this: "All right, here's the plotlines that are cooking right now, A, B, C, and D - don't forget, you all have contacts and investigation type skills. Erica, what do you want to do?" "I want to go talk to my father and see if he knows anything about the car bombing." "Do you want to visit him at home or invite him to your restaurant, or have him over to your apartment for dinner?" "Umm...at his home is good." "Do you drive yourself or take one of your family's cars?" "Oh, I use a driver." "What do you wear?" "My professional businesslike clothes, how I normally dress when managing the restaurant." "Is he surprised to see you or did you call ahead?" "It's a surprise." "So he's maybe still in his dressing gown and slippers?" "Sure." And so on. There are plenty of times when someone has asked a question and I've successfully put it back in their laps by saying "Whatever." dismissively. The downside to doing this is that it's possible, with some players even likely, that they didn't have a clear idea or preference for the answer of the questions, "Where are they sitting? Are they close enough to touch?" and if you throw it back in their lap, they'll say "Whatever" too and there's the naked result that everyone realizes nobody cares about a good chunk of the scene. That can kill inertia even when it's honest. Where was I going with this? I forget. Anyway, try breaking the scene framing down further into direct A-or-B questions that connect directly to stuff on their character sheets, then expand it out once they're comfortable with that, knowing that it's just a preference like any other.<br/>
<br/>
5) Yep, that's it then. What I suggest is really hammering home explicitly your out-of-character plans. Brag about them to everyone beforehand, get them excited about it too.  Sure, the character's a detective, but do you think Joe wants to risk his relationship with Travis or the group by "taking advantage of" an out-of-character fact just for character fidelity? Hell, nobody loves character fidelity that much. (That's a dirty lie, actually, but for another thread....)                        </div>
