All fronts start with a Scarcity: I think there can be at least one or two types of scarcity in the town. Someone needs something and that threatens the PCs. What is it? Who is it?<br/>Maybe have one scarcity on the outside, like a pack of hungry cannibals, keep it simple. <br/>Maybe the mutant hyenas. Throw in a Breeding Pit.<br/><br/>2. Look for things that are already shaping up: <br/>-Who or what is the Crimson Kite? Gang? Grotesque? What does it do?<br/>-How does Kettle feel about being stared down in front of his gang?<br/>-Who steps in as the new hardholder? How does he feel about the Gunlugger?<br/>-How do the previous hardholder's lackeys feel about the situation?<br/>-etc.<br/><br/>Not all of these need to be fronts but can be parts of fronts or simply on the home front.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
