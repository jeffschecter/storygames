I do envy the more regular that seems to happen elsewhere that I haven't been able to recapture post-college, though. If I could find, like, three more people with as much free time and enthusiasm as I have and an interest in playing weirdo Story Games that don't necessarily involve swords or lasers, I would be gaming more than is healthy. The funny thing is that I have friends like that, but geography has fractured us so I have some here but not <i>enough</i>. If I could collect them we'd be golden. Having more designer-friends would be handy too, as we could encourage each others projects and force each other to playtest.<br/><br/>There's not really a grass is greener place for me specifically though. I mean I could name some places that I think are like that but this stuff is always in flux. Really what I want is a utopic city where me and everyone I've had a blast gaming with could all live together in harmony and love.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218807/#Comment_218807" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T14:02:44+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  2:02PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm in Iraq. <br/>\n<br/>\nI've basically got the only thing going.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt'd be nice to be somewhere where I'm not the entirety of the gaming scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_218814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218814/#Comment_218814" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T14:25:38+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  2:25PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>I'm in Iraq.<br/><br/>I've basically got the only thing going.<br/><br/>It'd be nice to be somewhere where I'm not the entirety of the gaming scene.</blockquote>\nWin.<br/>Though the win condition for this thread is to be in a more destitute situation than anyone else.<br/>So it's kind of a tainted trophy.<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD: Tainted Trophy would be an awesome death metal band.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218816/#Comment_218816" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-16T14:27:42+00:00" title="July 16, 2009  2:27PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here in Baton Rouge, LA, there are exactly two gamers.

I mean, I personally know only a tiny fraction of all the area's gamers, but I have two very large groups to choose from, and those groups roughly know each other so there's even nice cross-pollination going. And then those players in turn have roots into the larger gaming scene, which we treat as a farm league. Every year or two, one new player will make the cut. It's been at least 10 years since I've gone to a gaming con or FLGS looking for fresh meat.<br/><br/>Honestly, two nights of gaming is more than enough for me anyway. Any given night I could have 3 to 8 people on-deck to play pretty much whatever. I've got mini gamers, chit gamers, haaaard-core story gamers, trad RPGers, German-board-game gamers, CCG folks, whateva.<br/><br/>So, yay Phoenix.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_218998">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid" title="HiQKid"><img alt="HiQKid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/HiQKid">HiQKid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/218998/#Comment_218998" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T10:18:25+00:00" title="July 17, 2009 10:18AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I live in Pawtucket, RI. It's... not too bad to live in, I guess. Near Providence, which ought to help, but doesn't. All the gamers I meet are either TCGers or Minis players. The handful of roleplaying groups I've met have been hardcore D&amp;D players, usually with the kind if DM driven/controlled play I don't go for. I've even been known to attempt to entice passing Magic players at game shops to join me and my friends for a game.<br/><br/>Which leads me to them - my usual play group. They are, I'll admit, a delightful bunch. They'll play almost anything I throw at them, though with mixed levels of enthusiasm. And the enthusiasm is a slight problem, as I'd prefer if they were really into what's happening - picking out new games to play, giving me feedback on what they like and don't like, helping me playtest, and the like.<br/><br/>Also a problem is scheduling. Most of them lead hectic late-teen lifestyles - finishing high school, getting ready to go to college, job hunting, partying, and so on. Amongst the 4 or 5 of them, I'm lucky to have two or three show up once every week or two - if that.<br/><br/>Unfortunatly, I'm not exactly sure where the grass would be greener. Seatle, or Portland, or if I were closer to Boston maybe.<br/>Or maybe if I had the same exact situation, except in like Hawaii or something. I mean, I'd still be lacking for gamers, but... palm trees and beaches and ladies in bikinis, no?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DannyK" title="DannyK"><img alt="DannyK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/122/nRGT4Y5WCWCME.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DannyK">DannyK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219005/#Comment_219005" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T10:27:40+00:00" title="July 17, 2009 10:27AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seattle's great...

Besides those who've already left MA for said greener pastures, that is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco" title="Ogremarco"><img alt="Ogremarco" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://p-userpic.livejournal.com/25764803/403381"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ogremarco">Ogremarco</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219235/#Comment_219235" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-17T22:53:35+00:00" title="July 17, 2009 10:53PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I live in the Seattle area, and it rocks. I have several gaming groups and plenty of regional cons to get my game on. GPNW is a solid weekend of awesome that brings in people from near and far.<br/><br/>Fuck everywhere else, though I do like Portland, but that's only three hours away.

It is chock full of awesome as Andy said.  Game scene here is pretty good.  A lot of gaming happens here and I've found it to be gracious to a fledgling gamer.  MY schedule is what mostly keeps me out.  Sure I would like to game more but live happens which is fine.  It's better than it not happening.  And there is a ton of cool non-gaming stuff in the area.  It's centrally located half way between the mountains and the beach.  Only a few hours from DC or Charleston.  It would be nicer if FLGS All Fun &amp; Games was closer though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
