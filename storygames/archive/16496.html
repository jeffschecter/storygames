I didn't know a ton of people in the industry, and most of the places where I could meet people were open forums like this one. I think open forums are great, but they have a different type of dialogue and discourse than smaller, closed conversations, especially when those conversations might be about sensitive, proprietary stuff like the financial side of game design. In some ways, we want answers (ex: where is the cheapest place to get something printed?), not discussion.<br/><br/>Thus, The IGDN: <a href="http://bit.ly/theigdn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/theigdn</a>\n<blockquote>The IGDN provides a safe ground for new ideas and opportunities, a place where developers (both young and old) can propose new thoughts in a supportive environment to help each other achieve their goals, including business success.</blockquote>\nIt's an email based group, and we've got about 10 members who regularly post questions about how to run a Kickstarter or the best place to get books printed. Sometimes we talk about design hurdles or bounce ideas off each other, but we've found that we spend most of our time trying to make the business side work.  It's a tough job and the support is nice.<br/><br/>We are totally open to taking on new members, so please feel free to apply if you're interested.  I think the conversation would be even better with a few more designers in the mix. <br/><br/>And if any of the other IGDN members who frequent this board want to chime in, I'd be thrilled to have them share their perspective on it as well.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377800">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377800/#Comment_377800" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T10:27:57+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 10:27AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mark, where does the money go?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377810/#Comment_377810" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T10:58:43+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 10:58AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://bit.ly/theigdn" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/theigdn</a><br/>(HTML ain't hard, y'all....)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_377816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377816/#Comment_377816" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T11:41:15+00:00" title="May 11, 2012 11:41AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I've noted before, this is a cool concept, Mark.

Google groups would be perfect for a community like this.<br/><br/>Are you planning to hold seminars or conferences? Are you going to lobby on behalf of your members?<br/><br/>Those are the sort of things professional organizations that collect dues generally do.<br/><br/>I'm not dismissing this idea. I think it's a good one. I just think that you should be very transparent about where member dues go. I also think it might be a good idea to offer some kind of free membership to people who just want access to the email list, assuming you are going to offer more than that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377861/#Comment_377861" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T15:28:03+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  3:28PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't really care where the money goes (everyone's gotta eat) but I do want to know what I get for it.

There are a number of people involved that I think are awesome and wonderful, but it's up to them to identify themselves if they so choose to do so.<br/><br/>2) We collect dues for two reasons: to make a serious commitment to the project and to fund projects like our GenCon booth.  We want people to make the community a priority, and that tends to happen more often when people "have a little skin in the game." In addition, there are cost to promote and manage the group, like banners for GenCon, that are easier to meet when people have a regular financial commitment.  I'd also like to note that the first three months are always free for new members; we are only interested in collecting dues from people who feel like they get something from the project.<br/><br/>3) I think members are discussing all sorts of different plans, but I know that profitability is a piece of the puzzle that people really want to talk about. Honestly, we talk about whatever people want to talk about, including crazy design ideas and our GameChef entries!<br/><br/>I noticed that there's some pushback here about the very idea of a "pay to play" email list, and I totally get that. It's a different structure and model for discussion, one that relies on the value of like-minded individuals with a vested interest in specific outcomes talking to each other. If that kind of thing doesn't appeal to you, I totally understand. I frequent this forum precisely because the IGDN doesn't fill all the needs I have when it comes to gaming discussions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_377881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/377881/#Comment_377881" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-11T19:09:56+00:00" title="May 11, 2012  7:09PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Mark.<br/><br/>Explanation <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> makes a lot of sense, and I'm glad to hear you'll be using the funds for promotional purposes.<br/><br/>That said, like Arpie, I'm not in an economic place where I can spare $10/month.
