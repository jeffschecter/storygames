I was playing Lenora, a <b>Ghost</b> whose death occurred when she was sacrificed in a ritual to create the embodiment of an idea, which turned out to be a <b>Hollow</b> called Skye.<br/>\n<br/>\nLate in the second session, Lenora and Skye faced off over who had the right to live; Lenora lashed out at Skye by actually entering her body and squeezing her organs from the inside! Unfortunately, Skye was her Darkest Self by then and had no problem attacking her own body to harm the unwanted passenger, so Lenora also got tipped over into her Darkest Self and ended up bound within Skye's body  for the time being.<br/>\n<br/>\nTaking advantage of the situation, Skye accessed Lenora's memories to find out what she knew about the ritual used to create Skye and her Hollow Sisters;  at this point, I turned to Scott, our inimitable MC, and said, "I think I've just escaped my Darkest Self."<br/>\n<br/>\n- <b>The Ghost:</b> You escape your Darkest Self when someone acknowledges your presence, and demonstrates how much they want you around.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt which  point, Skye's player said, "In that case, I  have as well."<br/>\n<br/>\n- <b>The Hollow:</b> To escape your Darkest Self, you must come face to face with someone who feels more trapped than you do.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt was a good, if totally unexpected way, for two characters to mutually benefit each other: as Scott said, "You just had a Darkest Self sixty-nine."                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_380165">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Neil" title="Neil"><img alt="Neil" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Neil">Neil</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/380165/#Comment_380165" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-30T01:13:06+00:00" title="May 30, 2012  1:13AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was a really fun couple of sessions of Monsterhearts.

The mechanics will never be the whole picture, because Monsterhearts is about the stories people tell within those mechanics.<br/><br/>So: The Ghoul goes into their Darkest Self, and their nearest Hunger is sexual. Ask The Ghoul, "What do you do?" When they answer, ask The Mortal, "What do you do?" Keeping asking those questions, and keeping calling for people to make moves where appropriate.<br/><br/>It's probably unlikely that these two characters would get caught in an endless, hungry sex loop. But (and I can't help but giggle here) such a thing isn't unprecedented in the genre! In Buffy S4-E18 ("Where the Wild Things Are"), Buffy and Riley get caught in an endless, exhausting, cosmically-binding sex loop. Unkind spirits keep them locked in perpetual sex until their friends come to the rescue. So, uh, you know: whatever happens, happens.<br/><br/>But really: the Ghoul satiates its sexual hunger, and remains its Darkest Self. It's totally fine for them to then run off and satiate one of their other hungers, or for them to just keep gorging themselves on that one single hunger. If they choose to stay around and gorge, then you still need to uphold your agendas, especially: Make the PC's lives not boring; Keep the story feral. That means introducing new situations.</blockquote>\nSo, like, in your session... the "sex until dawn" thing sounds totally awesome, and like it was a fun solution for you guys. Great! If that hadn't been the case, however, the Agendas and Principles would have been the place to turn for "what happens next."                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381564">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381564/#Comment_381564" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-09T00:11:47+00:00" title="June  9, 2012 12:11AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">[cite]Posted By: Noofy[/cite]Oh James, that's Wicked.

Even once I'd been restored, I remained in Skye's body so that we could do a bit of tag teaming when it came to an epic confrontation on the high school football field in the next scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
