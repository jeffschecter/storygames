If I'm going to make a product that will sell tops 100 copies and I'll maybe make a buck or two per copy, is it reasonable for me to spend $100 and up for the art? (Very ballpark numbers here and please correct me if I'm way off.)<br/>\n<br/>\nClearly, if the artist is succesful and already getting good pagerates in the industry or elsewhere, than there is no reason for him or her to charge less just because the gaming industry is smaller. But what about those middle-tier artists who have the talent but not a lot of exposure or experience yet? Would it be more reasonable to cut them in for a percentage of the profits, as teeny as that may be.

For one, it's highly unlikely that the artist will make nearly enough to make the hard work worthwhile and most experienced artists know it, so you're reliant on good Samaritans helping out. For another, there's the administrative cost of having to keep track of sales and divvy up royalties at regular intervals. This also cuts further into profits because of the fees extracted by companies like PayPal who handle the transfer of fees.<br><br>This, I think, is one of the reasons that the vast majority of Indie publishers make heavy use of clipart and out-of-copyright artwork, when they aren't in a position to make their own images.<br><br>Me, I'm not in this business to make a profit.

How much to RPG writers get?  Like 2 cents a word or something, right?  So that's like $10.00 a page.  But a full-page of art is around $100.  I recognize that the effort to draw a page of art and probably the impact as well is greater than a single page of text.  But ten times greater?  And greater to the point that it is not valid for a small press designer to include any actually illustrations in his or her work?<br/>\n<br/>\nOne interesting strategy is to trade the foreign license for your book for art.  Simon W. did this with Barbarians of Lemuria.  A french group wanted to translate it and had an artist lined up who did quite a lot of beautiful and consistent art.  Simon gave them the rights and they allowed him to use the art here in North America and it improved his book immensely.  Chris Rutkowski did the same thing with his BASH Ultimate Edition that is coming out soon.  An Italian group translated the older version of his game and let him use their cover for his new version.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder how European rates compare.  They have such a thriving bande-dessin\xe9e industry and culture there, I wonder if there are more active artists and if their pricing is more competitive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240726/#Comment_240726" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T08:43:52+00:00" title="November  6, 2009  8:43AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you're trying to publish an RPG project cheaply, I think suggesting deals like this are a good idea.

Firstly, I don't think I've ever paid more than $50 for a black-and-white illustration regardless of size. Most of the time I look at around $25 a picture and bulk up the rest of the book with public domain images and my own art, such as it is. Shop around for your artists a bit and you can get some decent images for less than what many people call 'the market rate'. Secondly, as a writer I know I can knock out 1000 words in around an hour. that's about 1 letter-size page on average, worth $20. I generally expect artists to spend between two and three hours on a black-and-white image, which would be $60 at the same rate, so actually there's not that much difference. And I rarely pay as much as $60 for an image either, but then I usually have simple needs.<br><br>I do agree that writers are underpaid though. It's very few the job offer that pays as much as 2 cents per word, which is annoying since that's the point where it actually becomes worthwhile for me.<br><br>Yeah, I saw the Barbarians of Lemuria deal. That was an extremely lucky incident for its creator and I wish that kind of deal was viable more often. Thing is I'm really unsure how you'd go about arranging that kind of deal from the other perspective, i.e. offering your game for translation before its been released. Unless you're quite well known or the game has been previously released and has a good following, I suspect it wouldn't often be possible.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nojh" title="Nojh"><img alt="Nojh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nojh">Nojh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240732/#Comment_240732" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T09:04:31+00:00" title="November  6, 2009  9:04AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm the Art Director (among other things) for a budding indie RPG company. Art Director is just the fancy title for the guy who begs artists for art for our books. I've been running around with my head cut off trying to find art for our next book. This particular issue has been in the fore front of my mind (and wallet) for the last few months. Here is what I have found:<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is mostly from an indie perspective. And an RPG perspective more than a board game perspective.<br/>\n<br/>\n1. How much effort art takes to create is highly subjective to the artist's skill level and style, as well as your specific requirements. The entire Art community seems to have a very hard time determining what standardized prices for art should be, can be, what their art is worth. It is very much a market where prices fluctuate based more upon demand and what it can bear, than the actual inerrant "value" of the art pieces.<br/>\n2. Any artist who has done a little bit of art for awhile knows they can sell their art on the internet and get money for it. IE commissions. Which means most artists seem less inclined to take bets on things like share percentages of profits because they can just wait for commissions instead, assuming they have some kind of web presence.<br/>\n3. The concept of "getting exposure" doesn't seem to mean as much to an artist as it does to a writer or game designer. Trying to trade on the idea of getting credit, free advertising, doesn't seem to appeal. This might be because of #2. It might be because artists want more desperately to be the self-supported on their art.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe rules change if you get bigger or have more of a history, you can prove to the artist that it is more likely they will recoup their personal views of how much their art is worth. Also your advertising becomes more valuable as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think though the real issue is that there is a conception (and not necessarily a misconception) that anybody can design, and anybody can write, but not everybody can make art. So writers and designers are willing to not accept money in order to do their work but people value artists for their rarity and skill. Think about it. How many times have you met someone who could draw and went "ooh, would you draw this for me?". Now how many people have you met who could write and you said "ooh, would you write this for me?"<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm starting to ramble so I'll stop with this point: Sometimes flat-fees can be to the non-artist's benefit. Depending upon how generic or useful your art is (for example logos), you can re-use the art across several products without it looking cheap. Also there are tricks non-artists can due to re-use the art they've purchased (assuming they have the rights to the art) in interesting ways. Examples including cropping and zooming (on portrait style art) or texturing (for more abstract art). You can also re-contact the artist with their old work (or a new artist if you have the rights) And ask for tweaks and modifications. Usually this is cheaper and easier for the artist than starting from scratch. Another method is to offer up clip-art/out-of-copyright artwork as a base.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso I agree with Ash on the royalty situation. In my company we're already having to deal with that with our writers so the overhead for including a royalty based artist wouldn't be high, but it is still a lot of tracking and if the artist is sold on the idea of actually making money, you could be burning a bridge. Also I've talked with professional artists who have done RPG work for the bigger name companies. Apparently they have horror stories of companies not paying them, so that particular bad karma might be filtering down to us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240734/#Comment_240734" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T09:15:10+00:00" title="November  6, 2009  9:15AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2009 9:20AM by jenskot.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/submissions" rel="nofollow">Wizards pays 6 cents per word</a>. I believe Paizo pays 5 cents per word. Those are starting rates. It scales higher based on experienced and demand. 5,000 words a day is the minimum for many writers I've worked with.<br/>\n<br/>\nAt 5 cents (starting Paizo pay) a word for 5,000 words in a day, that's $250.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor artists of comparable experience I've seen rates for black and white work at $50 a quarter page, $100 a half page, and $200 a full page. With color costing double, covers prices varying greatly, and discounts available for bulk work. My understanding is that doing a full page piece can easily take a day.<br/>\n<br/>\nTime wise, I suspect writers and artists of equal experience working for the same employer are getting paid similarly.

I ignore these and drive on. They're honestly pretty laughable for the most part. It says a few things to me. It says that the poster of said ad is ridiculously presumptuous in thinking others will just trust in the fact that a total stranger will make any money on whatever project they're touting. It also tells me that they don't respect the efforts it takes to create decent artwork of any great complexity. <br><br>Look, you get what you pay for with regards to art. You're not just paying for a piece magically pulled complete and glowing from ones ass, you're paying for the artist's materials, past training, skills and time. I went to art school, I have to buy paper and ink and replacement brushes, I have to do revisions for you, do multiple versions of a piece, prepare files for uploading, I have a deadline. Being a working artist is not having a minimum wage job, or shouldn't be. It's very very easy for desperate artists to succumb to working for cheaper than they should be for 'exposure' or 'portfolio pieces', but freelance artists in general can be pretty touchy about the subject, because when you start underselling yourself, you're hurting your peers.<br><br>What are you really wanting to pay for an artist and what do you expect to get for that amount of money?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240738">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240738/#Comment_240738" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T09:22:00+00:00" title="November  6, 2009  9:22AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great responses, everybody.

Why is it such a struggle for us to get the same thing for our local con?<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd while the design solutions that Remi points out are quite successful, it also suggests that we use excellent design to mask the lack of available artwork at a competitive price.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240740/#Comment_240740" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T09:24:09+00:00" title="November  6, 2009  9:24AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To make only a buck or two per copy sold, an indie publisher would have to sell the game for, like, $4-$7.

I don't feel that my observations are the whole reason why.<br/>\n<br/>\nPosted By: jenskotArtists considering investing in a project might be greater persuaded by a true collaboration. Working with a writer creatively on a project beyond producing art may be attractive. Helping shape the world, characters, and situations can help motivate them to not only work with you but produce better work. Pitch them as if they were an investor.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've actually tried this method. One artist was on board, and then about half way through the proofing of the art. They came back to me and essentially said 'Well I don't have the time anymore for free projects. I have other people paying me for stuff'. Let me tell you that really felt like I was being played. I had proofs of good art and /then/ they decided to negotiate price with me slightly over a barrel as they knew my deadlines and knew how long I had. Walking away and looking for a new artist was just another setback. So I negotiated.<br/>\n<br/>\nMind you that wasn't the reality. I knew the artist on a more personal level and they weren't trying to steal money from me. I just misjudged how much they wanted to be apart of the project. This led me to another idea:<br/>\n<br/>\nArtists get a sense of accomplishment quicker and easier from commissions than in doing work for books or games. Being apart of the project, waiting days/weeks/months for deadlines, for writers to get a story done, not as satisfying as receiving requirements, producing the art, and getting paid. Writers, designers, etc, on the other hand, are used to how much we have to delay our gratification. We can't just throw our games up onto the internet and have people admire them. Well books can to some degree, board games not so much.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know how valid this idea is as I've only pitched the investor idea to about 5 artists, and only one every actual bite, and then turned around on it. Also don't take from this that artists are fickle. We've likely all had some experience with a writer or a tester coming onto the project, saying they are all in, and then dropping out a month alter when they realize the work they've dedicated themselves to.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240759/#Comment_240759" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T10:16:27+00:00" title="November  6, 2009 10:16AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I were to pay my artists a percentage of my profits, I would have to send them a bill.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240760/#Comment_240760" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T10:18:49+00:00" title="November  6, 2009 10:18AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2009 10:20AM by Remi.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nojh,<br/>Listen to yourself.

Fee + capped share, yeah, but even then you're basically negotiating for a better deal based solely on the faith someone has in your business plan. Most people won't (and shouldn't) take that deal.<br/><br/>The economics do change a little when you're talking large art buys (in the 20-200 piece range) of spot and character art (which is what I have mostly dealt with in my projects). Most print RPG projects aren't like that. For the typical load of art for a small-press game, just pay up front. It's fairer for you and for the artist(s).<br/><br/>This arrangement is only really viable when you're talking about significant workload from semi-pros, AND you have the business plan to back up your share offer.<br/><br/>I should also say that most of my AD experience is from the 90s, which was a very different world from today's.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240772">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nojh" title="Nojh"><img alt="Nojh" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nojh">Nojh</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240772/#Comment_240772" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T11:02:47+00:00" title="November  6, 2009 11:02AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2009 11:04AM by Nojh.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: RemiNojh,<br/>\nListen to yourself.

It's probably a lot more fulfilling and at least as profitable for them.<br/>\n<br/>\nI find your summary of my comment inaccurate and somewhat insulting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI won't argue that joining a hobby company isn't a bad idea from an economic standpoint. But I was very clear from the get go that all the people on the project have day jobs (so did the artist in question so I knew I was not stealing from their lively hood), that we're primarily volunteer, and that while we're working with the idea of making a profit, the reality of it is that most RPG companies don't make profit. Most indie games don't make profit. I thought I had found an artist who wanted to create a game, not make money, like myself and my friends in our company. I was wrong. In this way I felt betrayed (although I thought I made it clear the the feelings of betrayal were unfounded, and I knew it rationally, but it still felt like betrayal). Perhaps that is where Remi saw the "DARE" part of their comment.<br/>\n<br/>\nI like to believe that I am a writer who is serious about game-writing. I am not requesting work from major companies. I am apart of my own companies and I do find my work fulfilling. But I don't find it profitable. In order for it to be profitable, I need to sell books. One aspect of selling books is to have art in them because that is what the RPG industry expects. In this way, Remi, I feel your statement regarding indie writing being profitable is false.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut perhaps Remi is right after a fashion. It is the expectation that games require good art, created by the professional game companies, that is the issue. Artists know the value of their work because they can easily access other avenues for getting economic value for their work. Game writers, designers, we have no avenue for ascertaining the value of their game outside of publishing it with art, because without the art, as expected by the public, a majority of game players (including ourselves) won't even consider trying to play the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, I do wish there were artists who were in it for the "BAD IDEA". Who understood that they were volunteering their time, their skill, to make something for the gaming community, rather than just being in it for the money. Even artists who game, who have told me int he past they'd love to help make an RPG, have told me they need money for their art. Is the only value of someone's product in money?<br/>\n<br/>\n(Okay that last question was pandering. I know money helps make the world go 'round and that everybody aspires to get paid for what they like to do.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

That thread is <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=24429.msg238020" rel="nofollow">here</a> if you're interested. Good comments and good insights from many.<br/><br/>My wife and I recently started a local <a href="http://www.hammercon.ca" rel="nofollow">convention</a>. Part of our vision was a recreation of the play-focused cons I used to attend in Sweden back in the 90s, and one of the aspects of those cons were the glitzy convention programs. I recently found a few that I'd saved and were amazed at the production quality. Well, HammerCon being in its first year and operating on an out-of-pocket budget, we knew we couldn't spend megabucks on artwork. So I went on DeviantArt and posted <a href="http://forum.deviantart.com/jobs/offers/1354490/" rel="nofollow">this</a> on their forum. For $50 we got a really snazzy image which we used in our <a href="http://www.hammercon.ca/images/hammercon09_program.pdf" rel="nofollow">convention program</a> (PDF and colour print) and on flyers - even a bit of thrown-in art direction and logo work. What we didn't get was unlimited publishing rights, nor did we take away author's right to resell it to anyone else. It was a good deal for us and, I think, a pretty good deal for the artist (an established professional).<br/><br/>There's also <a href="http://www.illodeli.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.illodeli.com</a>, which offers similar prices and usage rights.<br/><br/>I'd love to see author/artist partnerships as I think aesthetics are often overlooked by indie game designers, with many notable exceptions (<a href="http://www.evilhat.com/home/dryh/dont-lose-your-mind/" rel="nofollow">Don't Lose Your Mind</a> is a fabulous piece of art, for example). As mentioned in the Forge thread, the problem is likely that the author has initiated the idea of the game and is invested in it, while the artist typically isn't as much. If you can get an artist excited about a project when it's still in the conception stages, a profit-sharing method might well work. If not, I strongly suggest negotiating single-use licenses for artwork that's already been produced rather than commissioning it all from scratch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240786/#Comment_240786" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T11:25:40+00:00" title="November  6, 2009 11:25AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roger</cite><br/>I'm not sure this is actually true.<br/><br/>It might<i>seem</i>true because the writer isn't being paid anything per se, but that just seems like crooked accounting. Not to mention editing, layout, and all those other things.</blockquote>\nFrom what I gather, there's a tendency for layout to be done by the writer, so that doesn't often factor into the price, and 'editing' to be done by a friend of the author for free, if at all. I know that I could never afford to pay an editor to look over my work, and would probably not get a huge amount of benefit from doing so either. I make do with comments from playtesters and asking buddies to proof-read in return for a copy of the PDF. Now art, that's something I usually can't do myself or get for free, and I'm pretty sure that's a common situation for a game writer to be in. Even games that use out-of-copyright art and clipart often have an original front cover.<br/><br/>Of course there isn't necessarily a need for it; 'Polaris' was illustrated with 100% reclaimed artwork from an out-of-copyright book, even down to its cover. Zero art budget. This is a fairly rare example though, as many creators want something new, exciting and contemporary to show their work off to its maximum potential. Sometimes old pictures simply aren't feasible anyway; there aren't many sci-fi images that are copyright-free for example.<br/><br/>The real proof I think though is in what jobs are offered. While there has been a slight trend recently toward looking for layout techs and editors, the vast majority of job offers on the RPG forums and elsewhere are for art or writing, mostly weighted towards art. Now I'll happily admit I don't visit every art and RPG site in the world, but of the ones I do visit, that's what I tend to see.<br/><br/>Or are you talking about the cost in man hours, time=money and all that? If that's the case I'd definately agree. If you calculate the time you spend creating games and work out a reasonable fee for it, you'll hardly ever find you get a decent return.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240790">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240790/#Comment_240790" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T11:29:01+00:00" title="November  6, 2009 11:29AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2009 11:29AM by Destriarch.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachek</cite>I asked a very similar question on the Forge a few years ago, after seeing a number of absolutely gorgeous indie games (like Burning Empires) hit the market.</blockquote>\nI think it's important to make a distinction here. Burning Empires, like its spiritual sibling Mouse Guard, is a licensed product based on a graphic novel. Those gorgeous images were all taken from a pre-existing comic book. I don't know what deal the author worked out with the comic's owner, but it's usual for such a deal to include the use of artwork. It's a great deal if you can get it, but swinging this kind of agreement with a property that's of a high enough quality to be worthwhile takes quite an effort.

More widely, how can we make it worth the artist's while, if we don't have much money up front? That's a pretty good question, I think. I like what Joshua says, above, about sharing in the project's success.

Like Mark W said. You pay pros. Pros do it for a living. They need to make money. Their level of dedication is usually such that they can make a living. If a pro is willing to do one piece of art for you because they like you, awesome. But don't expect them to keep at it.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt'd be the same thing with any asset you attempt to use to help you make your game. Professional editor. Professional publisher. Marketer. Web designer. Etc. If they are professional. If they present themselves as professional, you should expect to pay them. Up front, per share, in gold dabloons if thats how they want it. Because you're getting a professional. (Although if an artist demanded I pay them in Spanish doubloons I'd probably back away very slowly. ;)<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not a professional game designer/writer/art director/marketer/web designer/artist/etc. I may get paid for it (hopefully) but I don't present myself to others as such.

It is definitely a special case. It was also mentioned as an illustration of how important the artwork is. BE has been praised as a marvel of game design, but everyone I've tried to "sell it" to have balked at it due to the complexity of the mechanics. If it wasn't for the production values, I have a hard time seeing how it could've made the impact it did (Origins Award, etc).<br/><br/>IMHO, high quality, coherent art is very important in RPGs. I love razor-sharp systems as much as the next guy, but a good illustration does more for jogging the imagination and ensuring creative coherency between players than any descriptive dice mechanic does. For some more self-important horn-blowing, see <a href="http://www.hammergames.org/uploads/lachek/TDG.html" rel="nofollow">The Dreamer's Genii</a> - no way that game would've emerged without ThomasHVM's illustrations. It was an "Artists First" game, but I personally think it would've been even better if we'd gotten a chance to work on it in concert.<br/><br/>I'd love to see more author/artist teams partner up on indie game development.

You write a character, you world build, you write a setting, you write an encounter.  Lots of writing.  So you already are starting with a population predisposed towards more writing skills.<br/><br/>Layout... people get away with a lot on layout.  For the most part, things merely need to be readable.  Good layout is much more rare.  Still, you can sit down with a layout program and learn decent layout with some time.  1 &amp; 2 column format is not an intensely difficult thing to learn.<br/><br/>But art?  You can't do a lot of cheating with art.  There's no template, and no program will "draw" the art for you.  So illustration is going to be the least represented skill in the whole population.  (Maybe anime conventions swing the other way- a lot more artists than writers?)<br/><br/>People have already mentioned why that's a marketable skill, the effort and supplies that go into it, and the fact anyone really solid in it, probably will charge a solid going rate.  There's also the fact that artists can sell art to a vast market of media- you're not just competing price-wise with other rpgs- you're competing price-wise with anything that might use illustrations- comics, magazines, advertising, webpages, etc.  That just drives the prices up overall.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Remi" title="Remi"><img alt="Remi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a263/mondango/remi.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Remi">Remi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240810/#Comment_240810" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T12:18:05+00:00" title="November  6, 2009 12:18PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2009 12:49PM by Remi.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua: Whoops!

If I were to take a percentage, it would be a symbol of that stake, not a way for the publisher to pay me less.<br/><br/>Charity: I've successfully art directed two charity projects and [helped organize] Game Chef Artists First. There are times when artists will work for free, especially when it's a fun/easy project with their friends.<br/><br/>Issues: I have no issues. I'm pointing out where I, as an artist, have problems with what you, as a publisher, are saying. Placing blame on an artist for their failure to do work for free is ugly behavior. You paid nothing, they owe you nothing. Dismiss me as a grump if you like, but I'm deadly serious in saying the way you're approaching this is super-off-putting.<br/><br/>Cheapness: There is a tremendous amount of bad layout, bad writing, and bad editing in indie publishing. The high end games (i.e. Burning Wheel) costs a lot of money and time. It's not cheap. Either embrace the aesthetic of cheap or spend more money. Art is different because most people can tell at a glance if it's bad. It's hard to go cheap on art without embracing the visual aesthetic of cheap, especially if you have visions of Mouse Guard dancing in your head.<br/><br/>The Aesthetic of Cheap: I'm a big believer in cheap, personal publishing. I feel like the publishers in this thread would be best served by finding ways to express their personal vision rather than emulating high-end products whose budgets are out of their range.<br/><br/>[EDIT: edited material in brackets]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240815">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240815/#Comment_240815" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-06T12:38:38+00:00" title="November  6, 2009 12:38PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 6, 2009 12:42PM by Elizabeth.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remi, as an artist who participated in Game Chef Artists First, I have an issue with you saying that you "Art directed" Game Chef.

I think at this point, something has to come up front (or preferably, payment on delivery of artwork... I like to work a bit hungry).  But I wouldn't say % of profit.  That means you have to recoup your losses first.  That puts me on the waiting list.  % of sales is the way to go.  Even if it is a lower %.  <br/><br/>And yes, I do a lot of commissions.  The nice thing about commissions is that I then can sell the 2nd use rights cheap.  $20.00 for 2nd use rights of (usually) single figure, no background, FULL color.  That is pretty cheap, IMO, but I've made my money on the work, anything more is gravy.  It is nice to get a check for $200.00 (10 images) every once in awhile.  Much of Savage World's fantasy companion was 2nd use rights.  <br/><br/>If you have a low art budget and you are commissioning original artwork, my advice, if you approach me... make it simple.  One figure, simple background like mist or smoke... is a lot quicker than a full on battle or tavern or space station scene with 15 spaceships coming and going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240863">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch" title="Destriarch"><img alt="Destriarch" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Destriarch">Destriarch</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240863/#Comment_240863" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-07T00:38:37+00:00" title="November  7, 2009 12:38AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Yeah, exactly.

It might take longer to spot bad writing than it does bad art, and often you have to buy the product before you find out about it, but bad writing is far from invisible. As a reviewer I find occasion to complain about it quite often. If a game has a bit of bad grammar that's one thing, and very annoying in its own way, but I have seen quite a few games in my time that were just plain difficult to read because of the language they used, or had back-stories so poorly conceived and cheesy that they made me laugh out loud. Now sure, some people might not be able to appreciate the finer points of writing, to put it mildly, and in such situations a lot of errors can be missed in the text. But if they can't understand the game enough to play it, or the book is so disordered as to make it highly awkward to refer to at the table, that's that. Good writing in RPGs is about more than metaphor and simile, these are instruction manuals. They have to be clear and concise.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240866/#Comment_240866" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-07T01:53:39+00:00" title="November  7, 2009  1:53AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ash, I only said good writing is invisible. If somebody writes well, information is conveyed clearly and concisely, as you say, and that information becomes more important than the prose style. You read it and say "Aha! I understand! That's an interesting idea!" far more often that you remark "This mofo can write the pants off Stephen King!"<br/><br/>Writers are not popularly acclaimed for their prose style -- it's the stuff they write about that people actually talk about. People will put up with bad writing because they enjoy the content (in fiction, see: the "fantasy" genre) far more readily than... I was going to say more readily than people will put up with bad art for what it depicts, but I'm not sure I'm ready to stand behind that one... Let's just say art <i>tends toward</i> better quality in games with a bigger budget, but the writing's trajectory is not so smooth.<br/><br/>Art is supposed to convey information, too, but it does so in a very visible way. It's there to be looked at. Good writing, especially instructional writing, conveys information and gets out of the way while it does so.<br/><br/>So anyway, it just seems to me that people recognize their artistic shortcomings more often than their literary ones. Or maybe it's that if you write a game, you're going to practice your writing a lot more than your drawing and end up getting better at it? Most everybody can write enough to communicate at a basic level, so maybe it's just natural to assume if you can write a game system, you can write the text that explains it.<br/><br/>I dunno, maybe I'm wrong. I hear "I wrote a game, now I need to buy art and layout" a lot.

Talk about the great artist who's doing illustration for you... and if they're flaking out, don't be afraid to say so.<br/><br/>But really... unless you are totally on the shoestringiest of shoestrings, and have a genuinely compelling reason for your artist to have a vested interest in the success of your project, just pay them. A share deal is sprinkles on the ice cream for someone who is kind enough to work for what you can afford now - it's better to think of it as a tip if the art does its job well: selling your product.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel" title="Luke_Wheel"><img alt="Luke_Wheel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luke_Wheel">Luke_Wheel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240929/#Comment_240929" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-07T22:09:22+00:00" title="November  7, 2009 10:09PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>Artists are hired guns.

It seems a lot of the concern may be with startup costs.  Give the artist some amount of money to be able to use it in X copies of the game.  If you want to print more you have to go back and give them more money.  They may end up with less than they're asking for, but it seems better than a percentage deal since they see some money up front and you don't have to deal with accounting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Paying artists a % of the profits instead of a flat fee? - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10857/paying-artists-a-of-the-profits-instead-of-a-flat-fee/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Paying artists a % of the profits instead of a flat fee? - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/10857/paying-artists-a-of-the-profits-instead-of-a-flat-fee/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: Luke WheelWriters are a bit stickier.

That is of course different; that's more akin to getting prior approval from the publisher for a personal project of your own. If someone approached me and said 'I want you to write a fantasy game, go nuts!' I might be willing to consider a percentage because I could write what I wanted. If someone approached me and said "I have this fantasy game and a few basic ideas that I'd like you to flesh out" I'd want firm, guaranteed pay. The reason behind it is pretty simple; in the former case, any work I create can be recycled into my own project if it is rejected. In the latter case that becomes much harder because I'd be following someone elses' template.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_240949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240949/#Comment_240949" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-08T05:15:41+00:00" title="November  8, 2009  5:15AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite><cite>Posted By: Luke Wheel</cite>Artists are hired guns. Pay 'em for their work and move on.</blockquote>\nSame with writers?<br/><br/>Writers are a bit stickier. If there's actual content creation going on, then I think they should take a share. Otherwise, they're hired guns.<br/><br/>For example, Sean Sakamoto and Robin Laws got paid a flat fee for their fiction contribs to Blossoms. Whereas Sydney Freedburg earns a percentage of the sales of Bloodstained Stars.<br/><br/>Sean and Robin were paid out when they turned in their work or soon after. Syd has yet to see a dime.<br/><br/>-L<br/><br/>Art for games can be just as sticky.  What would Dark Sun be without Brom's stamp.  What would some of White Wolf's early look be without Rebecca Guay or Tim Bradstreet.  Sometimes, art CAN BE CONTENT.  Not always... and I will concede that readily.  Sometimes art in RPGs is simply to give the eyes a rest among the text... or be a simple evocation.  But other times, it can carry vast amounts of information, much of it subconscious.  Just because it is below the radar doesn't mean that it isn't as valid as a paragraph describing the odd ape tribes of Watoo.  <br/><br/>I think it depends on how involved the art crew is in the barebones foundation of the product.  My art for years and years of Champions work is probably not all that serious contribution as Content because I'm standing on the shoulders of 70+ years of comic book visuals.  My art for Houses of the Blooded was probably more Content because I was the solo artist and I spent a lot of time with John Wick discussing how we weren't going to show direct representations of NPCs, but representations of artifacts and culture left behind as a archeologist notebook.  I even designed an alphabet.  I was also in playtests and that influenced the art as well.... there was an intellectual involvement level with HotB that was higher than say, Mutants and Masterminds or generic fantasy pics for the upcoming multi-genre Hero 6th ed.<br/><br/>Although, I do know this... my art for supers has influenced the way people play.  There is along standing villain called Icicle.  She predates me by many years, appearing in some of the earliest editions.  For 5th edition, they wanted to humanize her a bit...so I did a robin hood like pic with her giving money and goods to the homeless.  Several folks have commented on that over the years.<br/><br/>I know I've changed the way people have played their own characters at my table.  By doing a character sketch, by emphazing or seeing some aspect in that character that they were not aware of and bringing it more to the fore.... and then seeing the players really adopt that part of their characters and use it more often.  Art is powerful and subtle... its language is not as precisely understood as the paragraph.  We all know (or should) about the framework of a Persuasive Argument in a paragraph.... but there is a school of thought that art has its own language, something that advertising and PR has been utilizing for over a century now.  Where you place a cigarette on an 8.5x11 ad is important, it influences the viewer in such different ways.  Art in RPGs CAN (but not always do) really affect the way folks play your games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_240950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chadu" title="chadu"><img alt="chadu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/chadu/pic/0003ch8e"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chadu">chadu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/240950/#Comment_240950" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-08T05:59:55+00:00" title="November  8, 2009  5:59AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FWIW, I did profit-sharing deals with artists, editors, and layout folks for both <i>Truth &amp; Justice</i> and <i>Zorcerer of Zo</i> (as well as making spot-buys of particular pieces of art). Profits were figured after costs for print runs for the quarter were paid.<br/><br/>Generally, the agreements lasted around a year or two, before dwindling sales numbers started reducing the bang for the buck for the folks sharing, then I'd offer them a lump-sum buyout.<br/><br/>It worked fairly well -- I got no complaints from anyone.

That statement wasn't really what I meant to say and it needs qualification, being far too much of a generalization.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I meant to say was that most indie game development is not a commercially viable way to run a full time business. For an individual product, yes, you can likely break even and even turn a profit. At least when compared to your out of pocket expense. Now if you start factoring things like your time and labor spent making the product, testing the product, etc. You're going to find your profit shrinking more and more.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll also point out that my only experience here is in the tabletop/pen&amp;paper RPG industry. We talked with one or two small publishers when our company formed, looking for advice, and all of them in one form or another said that this was a hobby industry and not to live with the idea that our game would isn't going to take off like the other major name brands and that the time we spend would be money "lost". That our company would not likely ever grown into something that could put food on the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut then maybe that was just their way of telling us we sucked and we should had given up then.

If you've heard of an Indie publisher, chances are it's because they're popular and widely spread enough to have made a profit. Also, how many Indie publishers share their sales data? Some do, certainly, but not all. I'd not like to make a blanket statement on how many do and do not make a profit because of two factors: firstly the definition of what is Indie and what isn't is extremely vague, and secondly because there is a dearth of statistical information from the lesser publishers, those who are most likely to make a loss. Could be that either one of you is right, and it would be interesting to know, but I'm not holding my breath for it.<br/><br/>-Ash                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi" title="Kobayashi"><img alt="Kobayashi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://zadkin.free.fr/logoBaveuse2.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kobayashi">Kobayashi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241020/#Comment_241020" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-09T01:08:45+00:00" title="November  9, 2009  1:08AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2009 1:09AM by Kobayashi.">edited November 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Concerning the Barbarians of Lemuria translation (as I did it and published it, the small group is actually two people ^^) :<br/><br/>_we had the right for the translation in exchange for the art and a small fee (which is due each year).

Some errors are costly. Distributors like Diamond pretty much nuke your chances of turning a profit if your volume is low. The stories I've heard \u2014\xa0lost stock, disappeared money, lies about printing status in favor of pitching something new and shiny \u2014\xa0they really raise my blood pressure. There are places for middlemen, but it's not your job as a publisher to make sure they're fed. If they're not offering you a profitable service, you don't use them. That equation was less obvious even four or five years ago. These days, though, it's pretty uncommon, at least in the Forge diaspora, to make that kind of mistake.</p>\n<p>James, by no means do I discount your experience. I don't know what your publishing objectives are, and I got no beef with people whose publishing goals don't include making a profit. What I should have said is, those indie publishers who choose to make a profit, do. If you <em>do</em> want to turn a profit and it's not working, then let's talk about how to fix that. (Golden Advice: Do What Luke Does.)</p>\n<p>The question of the size of the profit is another matter. I don't design and publish full-time. I design other stuff too, but game publishing is a chunk of my income that I really couldn't do without. Several designers make much more money than I do. None make more than I wish I did, and none of us make what we'd like to, but welcome to the world. But the problem is not margins, for instance; no one else is sucking all the money out of my work. I make an unheard-of (for most publishing, but not for indie publishing) 57% off each copy of <a href="http://glyphpress.com/shock" rel="nofollow">Shock:</a> that sells. If I were to sell through distribution, that would be more like 10% for a small increase in sales. If I were to be generous and say that retailers would increase my sales by 25%, I'm still making waaay less money. It only starts to make sense if a) it doesn't cost me anything to sell through retailers (cuz it can!) and b) it gets to people who weren't going to buy it from me or <a href="http://games.indie-rpgs.com/" rel="nofollow">the Un-Store</a>. That is, it's better than posters, cuz I don't have to pay for them and people get to play instead of just get sold to.</p>\n<p>I'm a third-tier indie publisher at best. If I can do this, then you, too, can make your publishing do what you need it to do.</p>\n<p>As long as it's not "make you fabulously rich". I mean, maybe it can, but you'd be the first.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/blankshield" title="blankshield"><img alt="blankshield" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.blankshieldpress.com/jamesgoplay.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/blankshield">blankshield</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241232/#Comment_241232" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-10T09:53:59+00:00" title="November 10, 2009  9:53AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua: That, I got no beef with.<br/><br/>Incidently, at an individual game level, "make a profit" is usually one of my goals, and has been acheived each time it's been set.

If it weren't a profitable use of Joshua's, he'd knock it the hell off too.<br/><br/>All told, lumpley games pays me about $20/hour - and that includes, yes, writing, testing, editing, fulfilling, and supporting my games, and that is, yes, pure profit into my pocket, after all my expenses, even cons and shit. $20/hour for supporting my games and for designing Apocalypse World and Storming the Wizard's Tower, hooray, but also $20/hour for <i>writing this forum post</i>, can you believe it?<br/><br/>So please! Please, for the sake of my blood pressure, I beg you! We pay ourselves for our time. Stop saying we don't, it's crazy.<br/><br/>I invested some time into lumpley games before it started paying off, back in like 2001-2002. A couple hundred hours, probably, over those 2 years. But that time was an <i>investment</i>, not unpaid, and over time it has paid me back like crazy. Choosing to invest it into lumpley games instead of into Civ-fucking-2 was the smartest thing I ever did.<br/><br/>Investing your time into a game design is a risk, of course it is. There's no guarantee that your game will pay you back. But that's the same as every risk you make in publishing a game, and the solution is the same: don't invest anything you can't afford to lose. Don't pay more for printing than you can walk away from; don't spend more time than you can spare.<br/><br/>But seriously. I'm a busy guy. I'm always looking for shit to ditch out of, obligations to abandon. If game publishing didn't pay me for my time and effort, I'd drop it in a heartbeat.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241481/#Comment_241481" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-11T12:47:50+00:00" title="November 11, 2009 12:47PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>I have yet to see a single indie publisher anywhere build their own time into their profit model.</blockquote>\nIsn't it reasonably common for startup entrepreneurs to not give themselves monetary compensation?

I think it's pretty important to think about what <i>kind </i>of time game design/publishing chews up. Like, are you doing game design instead of a different job? Or instead of a different hobby? Or instead of a different art project?<br/><br/>Because the kind of time and energy you're putting in, whether its revitalizing or draining, what else it's replacing in your life, makes a difference in how you view your endeavor. If you weren't game designing, would you be putting that same time/energy into playing video games, or into a second job? Because, obviously, game design is paying big in one of those situations and not the other.<br/><br/>If I weren't doing game design with that time, I'd likely be doing something else that was less profitable. Probably it wouldn't be profitable at all, and instead would be costly - playing video games, watching movies, cooking lavish meals for myself. All nice things, all far less profitable than game design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

It's that I trade on things that I do. If I could be a professional eater, fucker, cyclist, and moon-watcher, I would do those things, too. (OK, I know that most of those things can be done professionally. I invite you to explore those markets without me. Except the moon one. If you figure that out, let me know.)</p>\n<p>If the value of my time is in dollars and profit was defined solely in dollars, and it was my objective to maximize my profits, then if I weren't making money on games, I have to stop making games. Presumably so that I could do something less enjoyable to make money to buy more time. The arithmetic isn't very good.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, I both make money making games and profit by doing so, gaining satisfaction that I would otherwise have to pay for.</p>\n<p>Those hours are often an investment. Sometimes I don't want to work on a game. I've got a great idea for what I want it to be and I don't have any idea for how to get it there. Those times are a drag. But it's still valuable time, living my life, even if the payoff is merely in dollars (investing in making a good game) rather than being an immediately enjoyable moment.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_241839">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241839/#Comment_241839" name="Item_76" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T07:48:29+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  7:48AM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joshua, thank you for going back and rereading what I posted. Now please indulge me and read it in context with the Original Post, which is how I wrote it.<br/><br/>I totally didn't intend to get into the worthiness of indie publishing models, or whatever. That's not where I'm at. I'm asking about paying artists a % of the profits, where "profits" themselves aren't even uniformly measured between publishers.<br/><br/>(Cover price) - (printing and fulfillment costs) = profit? That's not how most people in business use that word. We might call that the gross, but never the profit. If you're paying your artist a % of the gross, that's cool and all. But it's not paying a % of profit. It's a different arrangement with different implications of investment by the creators (designer, publisher, artists) into the project.<br/><br/>That is all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_241900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/241900/#Comment_241900" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-11-13T14:50:22+00:00" title="November 13, 2009  2:50PM">November 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lightbulb.
