Instead of looking for exact matches, it searches for a possible meaning or a possible match between experiences or mental representations. It is thus an integral part of processing language, and of attaching meaning to communication.</blockquote>\nAnd another:\n<blockquote>I\u2019d like to invite everyone to follow the rabbit hole that starts with the wikipedia article on transderivational search. Maybe I\u2019m wrong and it has nothing to do with RPGs, or maybe it has but it\u2019s just a name for something too generic and theoretical. For me personally, the concept resonates with several situations that I\u2019ve experienced and being aware of this mental process helps me understand why some things sometimes flow more naturally and others don\u2019t. How about you?</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
