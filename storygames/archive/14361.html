No convoluted plot or excess of named NPC's.<br/>The PC's will be badasses who will be able to face any opposition thrown at them. The adventure is meant to be a challenge, but the players will be able to decide when and how to fail (if ever).<br/>It has to have a climatic showdown (of any kind).<br/>It has to have a clear goal and the players must get a McGuffin out of it (which can be either the goal or a reward for reaching the goal).\n<h2>Extra:</h2>\nIf you propose more than one adventure, you can link them through NPC's, themes or concepts. There is no need to worry about anachronisms, genre, time period, style or "realism". Any action genre will do.
