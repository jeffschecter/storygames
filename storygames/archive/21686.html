Volo's plays around with how some of the monsters work and their statblocks, so last session involved some monsters that were easy to hit (low AC) with a decent amount of HP and multiple low-damage attacks (making them likely to strike and whittle away at HPs). The monsters had a bonus to some ability scores and a penalty to others, and it suddenly was apparent to me that it didn't really matter.<br/><br/>Does a monster having a +10% chance to succeed on a saving throw actually matter? What about a monster with an Armor Class of 15 vs. 13? Does that design component really add anything to the gameplay experience? In theory, yes; in practice, possibly.<br/><br/>On the players' side of things, mechanical fiddliness matters. In the course of a campaign and many rolls, the mechanical complexity creates a noticeable difference. Mechanical distinctness between characters matters to some players. Likewise, Power escalation is a core principle of D&amp;D, and I think that removing it would be a mistake (the zero-to-hero arc).<br/><br/>Yet there's a part of me that wonders if the game of D&amp;D would be missing anything if it stripped away the majority of this complexity from the DM's side of things. To reframe the question: how much of the "D&amp;D experience" is based on the numerical treadmill? You find a +1 sword so that you can fight a monster with +1 armor. You gain +3 hit points so that you can fight a monster that does +3 damage. And so on.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474448/#Comment_474448" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-04T20:42:07+00:00" title="June  4, 2018  8:42PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This goes further than D&amp;D.

This has a variety of practical impacts, though. In 3e, this resulted in magic-users going bonkers and destroying non-magical class niches at higher levels. "More stuff" happened in all kinds of ways in 4e, and you could see encounters often stretching out a lot as soon as you hit paragon.<br/><br/>That's not just restricted to D&amp;D. Most people I've ever played with or talked to about Burning Wheel tend to play 3-5 lifepath characters, often restricted to humans. There are a variety of fictional and personal reasons for that, but just in general, the game can get kind of overwhelming with huge exponents, very large skill lists, resources to have very powerful relationships or gear (like armor), and dealing with different shades.<br/><br/>I don't really question that principle/feature of games, though. At least not across the board.<br/><br/>The kinds of things I continually come back to and question are arbitrary difficulty numbers and the nature of 1d20 (I also deeply dislike Disadvantage). Interestingly (perhaps?), I think Apocalypse World's system does a hell of a job of addressing not only those issues, but also your interest in stripping away clutter/complexity on the GM-side.<br/><br/>That is NOT to say the games are interchangeable or that someone should just play Dungeon World if they want a D&amp;D experience. But as time goes on, my interest in D&amp;D (especially in <i>running</i> it) is more directly related to the number of illusionary constructs I can do away with. That's also not to say I'm into hacking and homebrewing and still calling it D&amp;D, but I <i>do</i> think the game is pretty much intact if you have, say, a transparent, non-arbitrary system for skill-check difficulties.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474458">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474458/#Comment_474458" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-05T13:53:50+00:00" title="June  5, 2018  1:53PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The numerical increments I care about are the ones which demarcate levels of challenge.<br/><br/>If I can handle an enemy with a bunch of stats X, but I can't similarly handle an enemy with a bunch of stats X+Y, then Y is a relevant increment.<br/><br/>In D&amp;D, I've generally found +2 to be relevant on this scale, and +1 a satisfying step on a journey toward a +2.

For example, the various build bonuses and circumstance modifiers are very nearly too fiddly in many D&amp;D treatments, precisely because the dicing mechanic encourages throwing in little +1s and +2s everywhere. There are a few old wargaming techniques that favour those small bonuses, but for the most part D&amp;D gamers are not benefited by spending time and mental energy on the small stuff.<br/><br/>An interesting observation in this regard is to note how reliant on 1d6 rolls original D&amp;D is, and how the combat checks are more of an exception to the rule. While modern D&amp;D is all about the d20, the most common rolls in more old-fashioned play are 1d6 rolls at various odds. This is largely an advantage for the old game, as a +1 for a d6 <b>is</b> a pretty meaningful thing in a way that it isn't for a d20 roll. If I had to drop one of those dice from a Basic D&amp;D treatment, I'd definitely drop the d20 and run the whole thing off the various d6 roll techniques the game uses anyway.<br/><br/>My go-to home D&amp;D treatment deals with this in the opposite way, though: I make all the numbers bigger than usual for official D&amp;D rules texts, which helps modifiers and such actually matter as much as they should. This isn't a simple formula (couldn't be, of course), but generally you may expect that something that traditional rules score as a +2 will become the equivalent of a +5 with me. Handling shields, for example - the main tradition has a petty +1 for a major defensive implement, while I prefer giving a shield-user an active defense roll (a much greater boost to defense most of the time).\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" rel="nofollow">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Yet there's a part of me that wonders if the game of D&amp;D would be missing anything if it stripped away the majority of this complexity from the DM's side of things.

I would even argue that the kind of play mainstream D&amp;D shoots for these days would benefit from simple, generic <i>and static</i> monster stat blocks. Not only would that help the GM bottleneck, but it would also make the variable stats on the player side more meaningful when the baseline monster competence wouldn't get lost in the noise all the time.<br/><br/>As an example of what I could well see myself doing in the new school context: just set up standard stat blocks for monsters at any given HD, such that all monsters at e.g. 3 HD are mechanically identical. Then add on top of that by giving each monster 1-3 distinguishing traits. For the most part these should be qualitative special abilities like "Invisible" or "Drains Blood" or such, or dramatic weaknesses, but I guess some could also pertain directly to basic combat stats - 50% HP than the typical monster of this HD, for example. But most of the time do the same stats for everybody, and if you deviate, make it a big deviation rather than a piddly +2 HP.<br/><br/>(I could see myself adding a little bit of formalism to that trait allocation thing, like maybe every monster should have 1 trait per 5 HD rounded up, plus two extra if they're an "elite" monster - who also should have an explicit name and motivation. So at low levels every monster has 1 trait and elites have three, while at level 11 it's 3 and 5. Perhaps something like that. I would also decide that if you have a particularly powerful trait in there - whatever that means, e.g. spellcasting - then one of your traits has to be a disadvantage.)<br/><br/>I would expect this type of approach to improve the experience all around: the different types of monsters would have clear, thematic distinctions thanks to their different traits, but the GM wouldn't get crowded by the endless and useless stat lines. Monster design would be encouraged to rely on meaningful distinctions. The players would barely notice anything different in the monster stats, except perhaps that for once they can actually predict a bit about what the monsters can or can't do, because they're not facing an entirely different set-up in every fight, and the parts in which the monsters are different from the baseline really are dramatically different.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474462">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474462/#Comment_474462" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-05T15:53:19+00:00" title="June  5, 2018  3:53PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">@David_Berg</a>: My personal perspective is in line with yours. +10% matters to players. There's some psychological principle (name eludes me) saying that people only perceive a change once it meets or exceeds 10% of the original value. This can't be applied directly to a system of dice rolls, I don't think, as numbers are intangible, but the concept could apply. A +1 on a d20 roll is a satisfactory incremental increase in some cases because, again, you will be rolling the dice numerous times, making that incremental progress more valuable.<br/><br/>This, in particular, has been my own experience:\n<blockquote>In my groups, this usually consisted of players flipping through the monster manual with lots of, "Whoa cool!" reactions. "I would really feel like a badass if I beat this thing! Let's keep leveling up so we can get there!"</blockquote>\nThe matter then becomes: how much of the incremental advancement is required to get to that point? I find the Dungeon World treatment of the lauded "16 HP dragon" unsatisfactory, as the difficulty is almost entirely dependent on how hard the GM makes the fight, but in that same vein, I find the numerical bloat of modern D&amp;D needless.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a>:\n<blockquote>An interesting observation in this regard is to note how reliant on 1d6 rolls original D&amp;D is, and how the combat checks are more of an exception to the rule.

Interestingly, a +1 on a 2d6 is about a 10% increase on a straight 2d6 vs. 7.\n<blockquote>As an example of what I could well see myself doing in the new school context: just set up standard stat blocks for monsters at any given HD, such that all monsters at e.g. 3 HD are mechanically identical.

(Orcs, goblins, and kobolds have the same HD, but orcs have twice as many HP as goblins and thrice as many HP as kobolds. What purpose does this serve? Just give kobolds 1 HD, goblins 2 HD, and orcs 3 HD. Any changes to AC and damage can be handled by the equipment system as-is.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474463/#Comment_474463" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-05T15:56:11+00:00" title="June  5, 2018  3:56PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            D&amp;D and games of similar complexity made me end up asking myself what was the point too.

It has some similarities to the "16 hp dragon" in certain respects.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>As an example of what I could well see myself doing in the new school context: just set up standard stat blocks for monsters at any given HD, such that all monsters at e.g. 3 HD are mechanically identical. Then add on top of that by giving each monster 1-3 distinguishing traits. For the most part these should be qualitative special abilities like "Invisible" or "Drains Blood" or such, or dramatic weaknesses, but I guess some could also pertain directly to basic combat stats - 50% HP than the typical monster of this HD, for example. But most of the time do the same stats for everybody, and if you deviate, make it a big deviation rather than a piddly +2 HP.</p></div></blockquote>\nInteresting. This almost exactly describes how monsters are designed in both 4E and 13th Age (if you substitute "HD" for "level", that is). <br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474477/#Comment_474477" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-05T22:31:53+00:00" title="June  5, 2018 10:31PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 5, 2018 10:32PM by Eero_Tuovinen.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm gearing up to run a 4th edition campaign this summer, and as it's set in an independent setting and I don't care for D&amp;D fluff anyway, I'm probably going to just do what I suggested above for the monster stats.

I mean, the solo monster definition and specification is literally nothing more than the game designer stating that "hey monster designer, you should make some monsters that make for a fun fight against a party all on their lonesome!" Because the solo is alone, you can't really call it monster design even - it's just encounter design, and just like the GM needs to design the encounter by choosing the appropriate threats, they need to design the solo.<br/><br/>As you know, I haven't GMed 4th edition much, but from what I've read about it, it seems that the only reasonably solid approach to doing solos is to just treat the "single monster" concept as color: you give that solo monster the resources and capabilities of 4 (or however many) normal monsters, in whatever manner seems appropriate to the concept, and that should make them roughly gameable against a party of four characters. People seem to prefer dressing this up into "extra actions" and "extra saves", but how is that not just fooling yourself?

I mean, the solo monster definition and specification is literally nothing more than the game designer stating that "hey monster designer, you should make some monsters that make for a fun fight against a party all on their lonesome!" Because the solo is alone, you can't really call it monster design even - it's just encounter design, and just like the GM needs to design the encounter by choosing the appropriate threats, they need to design the solo.<br/><br/>As you know, I haven't GMed 4th edition much, but from what I've read about it, it seems that the only reasonably solid approach to doing solos is to just treat the "single monster" concept as color: you give that solo monster the resources and capabilities of 4 (or however many) normal monsters, in whatever manner seems appropriate to the concept, and that should make them roughly gameable against a party of four characters. People seem to prefer dressing this up into "extra actions" and "extra saves", but how is that not just fooling yourself? You want the solo to be able to act and shake off attacks like four normal monsters, so clearly the simplest approach to making that happen is to give it the stats of four normals.</p></div></blockquote>\nHi Eero,<br/><br/>I wouldn't get too hung up on the term "solo" here. Even as early as the DMG1, the encounter templates clearly show solo types being supplemented with other monster types (typically 1 or 2 groups of minions) or perhaps a hazard/trap, depending on the encounter. Actually one of the more interesting encounter templates is to use a solo that is a few levels lower then a party in the same encounter as a standard monster that is several levels above the party (and perhaps has the leader sub-type). It leaves the question open as to which monster is the "real threat" in the encounter.<br/><br/>The salient point is that a solo is a "quadruple monster" in terms of its XP value --- which isn't necessarily to say you should have one fight 4 PCs by itself, but that in terms of encounter budgeting its worth 4 monsters of the same level as itself. I actually don't think just giving a solo 4 times as many attacks and a large bonus to saving throws is actually a great approach, as the increased attack/damage ratios could easily lead to party wipes (a typical 4E monster can drop a same-level non-defender PC in 3 hits, so quadrupling that would lead to one-shotting PCs). What you typically see in the better designed solos (some of examples of which can be found in things like the Monster Vault books or the Dark Sun Creature Catalogue) is exactly what you outlined in the post I originally quoted you: special abilities and traits that make them more difficult to fight than regular monsters. As an example, when the MV black dragon gets bloodied it gains an "acid blood aura" that deals acid damage to every character in melee with it whenever it takes damage. Another example might be immediate action powers that trigger whenever a PC, say, moves into melee or casts a ranged spell or dazes them or whatever. This is a lot more interesting than just having a monster make 4 attacks each turn --- I mean, you *could* do that, of course, but its a lot more boring and uninteresting than the solutions the 4E designers came up with when the game really started to hit its stride.<br/><br/>(Although I don't actually care for the "quadruple monster" design here so much. Rob Heinsoo was the lead designer for 4E and in the 13th Age that he and Jonathan Tweet designed years later they only go up to "triple monster". I think there is good reason for that other than simplicity. In my opinion, putting 4 monsters' XP budget onto a single creature is too burdensome and can create problems. Limiting that to only 3 monsters' worth is a good alternative.)<br/><br/>The interesting thing about 4E's monster math --- and this is important in regards to "static monster stats" we've been discussing thus far --- is that the assumption seems to be that for every 4 levels' worth of difference you "upgrade" the monster to the next category. So, as an example, a 1st level solo = 5th level elite = 9th level standard = 13th level minion. Not that you should be throwing 9th level or 13th level monsters at a 1st level party, but if the fiction called for what would be a "9th level" monster by the books you could convert it to a 1st level solo instead. This does create a pretty tight range where monster stats should be within +/- 3 of the party's expected values. <br/><br/>5E of course has its solution for all this with its "bounded accuracy" design, although I disagree with Sandra here that it significantly "reduces" the numerical treadmill. Instead, it just frontloads it all onto hit points and damage. There is a reason 5E characters have significantly more hp than same-level 4E characters beginning around 4th level or so. It also has the side effect of greatly diminishing the sense of character progression that is intrinsic to D&amp;D (a 20th level character is only about 25% more accurate than a 1st level character in 5E). Of course, dumping most of a monster's mechanical weight into hit points and damage is also more difficult to balance for and one doesn't have to google for very far before one finds that many groups just toss 5E's encounter design rules as they're almost worthless for constructing moderately challenging battles for many tables (I suspect that, just like with 3E, most 5E GMs just eyeball encounter balance instead of actually using the pretty useless guidelines that are provided).<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474503/#Comment_474503" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-06T16:58:08+00:00" title="June  6, 2018  4:58PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Comparing a <a href="https://open5e.com/monsters/monsters_a-z/z/zombies/zombie" rel="nofollow">zombie</a> to a <a href="https://open5e.com/monsters/monsters_a-z/S/skeletons/skeleton.html" rel="nofollow">skeleton</a>.

All that's supposed to happen is that some resources are drained. The fight doesn't actually have to feel "hard" in the usual sense. If the Fighter took 20 points of damage, and the Wizard spent a 2nd-level spell slot, then the encounter has served its purpose. Because 5E (and several other editions) rely on there being a strategy level, not just a tactics level. Managing resting and healing and all that is where much of the real challenge of the game lies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474513">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474513/#Comment_474513" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-07T06:33:57+00:00" title="June  7, 2018  6:33AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I think what many are after when they are dreaming of the balanced encounter are a couple of different things at the same time.</p><ol><li>The players should risk TPK while there being no chance of TPK.

And picked a fight. And one NPC and one PC died. And the rest of the party surrendered and it got into a hostage situation, the game devolved into My Life With Master, it was pretty awesome</li><li>The party colonially routed a tribe of Batiri. The bird tribe is now extinct and their cultural heritage and folk lore are lost forever. This was a fight that took a while because whiffs on both sides but they managed to defeat them without taking casualties. It cost them a lot of HP but not many slots.</li><li>Two PCs (both level threes) went off on their own in the jungle. They ran into another, bigger tribe of Batiri [yeah I love it that you randomly roll how many there are]! They started running [I love the chase rules so much] and using spell slots on longstrider and using inspiration and what not. It took time because we had to resolve so many dice rolls with disadvantage but it was a resource expendatory fight. I didn\u2019t think there ever was any real chance that the Batiri would\u2019ve caught up to the two PCs. But I saw that they could hurt them, i.e.\xa0meaningful consequences, and that there was a lack of clarity as to how much.</li></ol><p>In all of these cases\u2026</p><ul><li>I could not have predicted that they would\u2019ve picked a fight with this NPC.</li><li>I did not know how many Batiri would be rolled in the \u201cno appearing\u201d. Nor that the PCs would want to destroy them.</li><li>I could not have predicted that two PCs go off on their own in the deep jungle.</li></ul><p>It\u2019s not a sequence of encounters that I as DM present to them. I don\u2019t know what level they\u2019re gonna be, how many of theme are gonna be there, if the party is split up, if we have absent players, if someone died in a previous encounter, if they have picked up some powerful NPC, etc etc. It\u2019s not Dungeon Chess, It\u2019s a chaotic floorful of loaded rat traps.

If you go strictly by 5e's book description, Heroism just makes someone brave and prevents them from being frightened. I think that means they could still be be deeply sad and grieve at the same time as being brave, but I dig an interpretation that it short-circuits the process. It could even say a lot about that character's culture - that bravery manifests via stoicism. Another character's culture might default to stoicism and Heroism would give them the bravery to show those emotions.<br/><br/>Imagine that backfiring spectacularly when a player character casts Heroism on soldiers who, unbeknownst to the players, only fight for their country out of fear and they needed that extra bravery to abandon the battle and escape the capital with their families.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474521/#Comment_474521" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-07T13:32:37+00:00" title="June  7, 2018  1:32PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>I think what many are after when they are dreaming of the balanced encounter are a couple of different things at the same time.</p><ol><li>The players should risk TPK while there being no chance of TPK.

You're 100% right that it's the "impossible thing before breakfast" of specifically D&amp;D encounter design since around 2000 with the advent of 3.0.<br/><br/>Where 5E really suffers is that the officially published adventure material often contradicts the "you need 6-8 encounters for the strategic layer to matter" (here "encounter" means any situation with a likelihood of resource expenditure necessity, not necessarily just "combat"). I've seen so many 1-easy-fight adventuring days in 5E; it makes me sad. Because it's a problem I've solved!

You can significantly over or under-shoot by-the-book XP values depending on what else is going on.</p></div></blockquote>\nHi Paul,<br/><br/>I agree on the point regarding encounter design, although my experience has been it isn't quite as weighty as you're describing it here. In general, I find that both 4E and 13A's encounter guidelines are pretty accurate and consistent --- at least compared to any other RPG for which I have had personal experience. Players are almost always in for a tactical challenge but rarely go through TPKs in my own personal experience (only had one TPK in years of DMing 4E and at no point did I ever resort to illusionist claptrap like pulling punches or fudging dice rolls). My opinion is good encounter design in 4E is less about "balanced vs unbalanced" and more about "interesting vs boring". <br/><br/>The nice thing about having a system with reliable, well-designed encounter design --- contrary to what many here seem to believe --- is that you as the GM are free to discard it and toss "unbalanced" encounters at the players whenever it suits the fiction of the game. As opposed to being *forced* to because the encounter guidelines in a game are so badly written that GMs as a matter of practice just ignore them and come up with their own framework for handling that instead. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_D_L" rel="nofollow">Paul_D_L</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>And a single enemy is a completely different proposition if the players have to simultaneously save people from danger or, say, interact with some infernal machine. 4e's skill challenges can really shine in such a context, but it's very apparent that so many people's experience with the game is, sadly, wading through monsters without much else going on because it's Time For A Fight.</p></div></blockquote>\nOh, most definitely. I've touched on upon this in the past but I think what happened for *many* people with 4E is they assumed they already knew how to "run D&amp;D" instead of meeting it on its own terms. 4E really shines when each encounter is moderately infrequent and has a lot of fictional weight so tried-and-true techniques in some other versions of D&amp;D, such as wandering monsters or "4 orcs in an empty 30' by 30' room", are just dead weight in 4E. Its the difference between encounter-based design and attrition-based design. I fell prey to this myself when I first started running 4E as I thought a "good adventure" was supposed to slowly whittle away the player's resources so they just barely have enough fuel to take on the BBEG at the end (assuming you can keep them from taking an extended rest). That may work in some other versions of D&amp;D but its a *terrible* approach to running 4E.<br/><br/>In terms of encounter design, this is how I approach my own home games:<br/>* No filler fights. If they absolutely can't be avoided, run them as a skill challenge instead. For that matter, around half of my encounters are skill challenges anyway, so there.<br/>* If we're pulling out the battle-mat, it should be a fight that a) matters and b) has a goal other than "kill the bad guys and take their stuff" (the examples you gave were pretty good there).<br/>* Don't spend the entire XP budget of an encounter on monsters, use at least 1/5 on things that don't have hit points like hazards or skill challenges.<br/>* For the love of God, don't have every bad guy fight to their last hit point. I personally use a morale system in my home games: bad guys make a saving throw every time they're bloodied, their leader dies, or 1/2 of their side is gone --- if a baddie fails their save, they flee or surrender.<br/>* Since others brought up resting house rules, in my games an extended rest only nets you +1d4 healing surges and +1 daily power --- however, reaching a milestone has the same benefit as an extended rest, too. In the new campaign I'm starting, I'm probably going to toss milestones and tie these rests to character quests instead.<br/><br/>Okay, enough of my rambling for now. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> <br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474573/#Comment_474573" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-08T06:58:06+00:00" title="June  8, 2018  6:58AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 8, 2018 7:01AM by 2097.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>you can\u2019t take more than 3 in a 24-hour period.</p></div></blockquote><p>This is something I would consider changing.

I don\u2019t think any D&amp;D version is, but for different reasons. Like, the DM can\u2019t curate the experience to that degree without taking away agency. 4E doesn\u2019t <strong>strictly</strong> need that degree of agency in order to be interesting (even though I think most players would like the agency) but 4E doesn\u2019t need the attrition to have interesting encounters.

No, the risk of death vs bees is a good thing, my paradigm is that it's the world as a whole that's the puzzle, that's the macro-encounter, that's the challenge. If you want to survive bees, rest up. If you want to go up vs Strahd, rest up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474575/#Comment_474575" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-08T07:20:30+00:00" title="June  8, 2018  7:20AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never had a group that even wanted to short rest more than 3 times in a day. And the martials are hungrier for HD than the casters are for slots!! My 5E can be a harsh game, but there's usually a little less of a pure sandbox thing going on than in yours, so it balances out.<br/><br/>As for 4E: having played Gardmore Abbey, I'm convinced that the right way to do 4E to maintain as much player agency as possible is half-tier sandboxes. Imagine a wilderness area around the PCs' home village as the Low Heroic half-tier. The random encounter tables have encounters with monsters up to level 4, with level 2 and 3 being the most common. Of the monsters placed on the map in fixed locations, they get gradually tougher as you go further from the village, but the PCs *could* seek out the highest-level challenge more quickly than they "should." And a 2nd-level group could theoretically beat a 5th-level encounter! It'd be hard as hell, but it's possible.<br/><br/>I actually sketched out a whole set of half-tiers awhile ago. My idea was for each half-tier to revolve around a central conflict, and while the PCs don't really have too much control over the what and where of each half-tier (4E requires too much prep for that), the outcome of each conflict will definitively impact the starting situation of the next one.<br/><br/>The idea here is not only to increase player agency, but also to solve the treadmill problem and the "fiction not mattering" issue 4E sometimes has. Having discrete moments when the world around the PCs changes and the environment becomes more, well, high-level, in a fictional as well as mechanical sense, would really help with some of my frustrations with the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474577/#Comment_474577" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-08T09:05:43+00:00" title="June  8, 2018  9:05AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>So original question that VSK had:</p><ol><li>Setting the question of leveling aside, and just looking at the fight system frozen at any given level: Are little tiny 5% here and there meaningfull? Not really. You can run a game like Cthulhu Dark where there are no stats except Insight which is your death clock. Or Dread. Or even <strong>no</strong> stats, just you roll a d6 everytime it\u2019s unclear whether you succeed or fail at <em>anything</em>, 3 or higher you succeed. Use fictional positioning, gear etc to determine whether there even is a chance. That said, D&amp;D does use its little differences here and there to flavorful effect, c.f. <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/474495/#Comment_474495" rel="nofollow">skeleton and zombie comparison earlier.</a></li><li>Is there a point to leveling/advancement? Just as how Insight is your death clock in CD, your level is another sort of narrative clock in D&amp;D. Also, allowing you to take on more foes and stronger foes is interesting. That said, I really appreciate how 5e <em>significantly</em> cut back on the treadmill compared to 3e/4e.</li></ol><p>And then the Q of encounter balance, using video game comparisons:</p><p>You can run 4e like Fire Emblem. A good game. You can run 5e like Breath of the Wild. Also a good game.</p><p>4e doesn\u2019t really need the \u201cnumbers go up\u201d thing, the level scaling, that\u2019s a separate issue. AC and to hit doesn\u2019t have to go up as much, I mean. HP and damage could go up.</p><p>Also like\u2026 someone <em>could</em> create a bunch of 5e monster roles (sort of like how 4e has \u201cskirmisher\u201d etc) and try to set up a bunch of ostensibly balanced 5e encounters etc. They wouldn\u2019t have to put all 5e monsters in those categories, they could just place enough in there in order to do satisfy those who want to encounter build. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019d make a <em>better</em> 4e, just that it would be sort of a comfort to those who love 4e but are stuck with 5e.

As opposed to being *forced* to because the encounter guidelines in a game are so badly written that GMs as a matter of practice just ignore them and come up with their own framework for handling that instead.</blockquote>\nI agree (with caveats), so let me play Satanic Advocacy Committee here for a second:<br/><br/>By creating a system with balanced encounter guidelines, you are pushing the game in a direction in which balanced encounters are the default, which creates a culture of gameplay in which balanced encounters are considered "fair," and deviations from this are "unfair." I am working to break several of my players from this mindset (along with the "a monster's existence does not default to a fight"), and it is an uphill battle.<br/><br/>In the context of a traditional RPG, the two primary alternatives seem to be:<br/><br/>1. No encounter design. Throw whatever at the party and hopefully it'll work out. This is entirely in the hands of the GM. A non-design element that isn't really worth discussing.<br/><br/>2. Terrible encounter design. The 3e and Pathfinder era really exemplified this. The system's bad, the math doesn't work, here are some arbitrary numbers that are a failed attempt to codify relative difficulty. Hopefully your players min/maxed enough that they can handle it, but hopefully they didn't min/max too much or else it'll be a cakewalk. (Alternatively: fudge, fudge, fudge.) Have fun! The end result: disillusioned GMs, frustrated players, gross dissatisfaction with the product, and a pox upon all our houses. Maybe the developers will release a torrent of system patches in the form of feat taxes or errata (4e), or maybe they'll throw up their hands and create a new edition because the old is unworkable (3e), or maybe they'll try to release a set of official published house rules to cover up the rough spots (Pathfinder, Trailblazer).<br/><br/>3. <a href="http://grognardia.blogspot.com/2008/09/gygaxian-naturalism.html" rel="nofollow">Gygaxian Naturalism</a>. James Maliszewski of Grognardia coined this term, as far as I'm aware. The article I've linked is a rather canny observation of how pre-3e D&amp;D worked, and it's where D&amp;D (in my humblest opinion) thrives. There are no balanced encounters in this style of gameplay, but when you come upon an orc village, you know you're going to find 3d10x10 orcs, and every three orcs will have a leader and and three assistants leading them, and every hundred orcs will have a shaman with them, and so on and so forth as the lengthy descriptions in the Monster Manual detail. This creates a world of emergent gameplay, where the pseudo-simulation of the fantasy universe springs into being as the PCs explore, and there's never a totally predictable encounter...because you might encounter 30 orcs at one time, or you might encounter 300 orcs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474592/#Comment_474592" name="Item_63" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-08T20:21:40+00:00" title="June  8, 2018  8:21PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            great post vallie. first of all perfect phrasing with the expectation of fair/unfair.<br/>second of all great description of the alternatives.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474607">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474607/#Comment_474607" name="Item_64" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-09T20:21:54+00:00" title="June  9, 2018  8:21PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2018 8:22PM by adamwb.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some versions of Gygaxian Naturalism become totalizing but it does have a counterpart that is much closer to \u201cbalanced encounters\u201d, with the caveat that they are at least partly decided by the players: \n<blockquote><strong>Number of Wandering Monsters Appearing:</strong> If the level beneath the surface roughly corresponds with the level of the monster then the number of monsters will be based on a single creature, modified by type (that is, Orcs and the like will be in groups) and the number of adventurers in the party. A party of from 1\u20133 would draw the basic number of monsters, 4\u20136 would bring about twice as many, and so on.

My 5E can be a harsh game, but there's usually a little less of a pure sandbox thing going on than in yours, so it balances out.<br/><br/>As for 4E: having played Gardmore Abbey, I'm convinced that the right way to do 4E to maintain as much player agency as possible is half-tier sandboxes. Imagine a wilderness area around the PCs' home village as the Low Heroic half-tier. The random encounter tables have encounters with monsters up to level 4, with level 2 and 3 being the most common. Of the monsters placed on the map in fixed locations, they get gradually tougher as you go further from the village, but the PCs *could* seek out the highest-level challenge more quickly than they "should."

A skill check might be to find a clearing that's surrounded by rocks on one side and situated at the top of a hill, and so defensible. <br/><br/>Note that, in 5E, a long rest (or, in my rules, a medium rest) being interrupted by a combat encounter does not, by RAW, reset the clock or disrupt the rest. It's only if the group is forced to pick up camp and relocate that they really get screwed. So a single random encounter during a day of long-resting, or even two, is not the end of the world... but it can happen, and thus they shouldn't wait toooooo long to rest, or else they'll face those encounters while low on HP and spells and such. And if things go really awry, there could be circumstances where they were forced to move camps, and thus relocate.<br/><br/>But it's probably more accurate to say that their ability to rest *completely unmolested* is what's uncertain.<br/><br/>In actual practice, resters gonna rest. My players have been good about not resting too often, while also not being suicidal. There's a sense of danger and uncertainty to the way I do resting, sure, but it's not tremendously punishing.<br/><br/>There have definitely been times when I relented and just let them have the long rest, because interrupting it would have been both cruel and nonsensical. The best example I can think of is after they had just liberated a bunch of prisoners from a bandit camp. They were beat to hell and definitely needed to take a 24-hour DLR (Deliverator Long Rest). They had like 50 friendly civilians nearby, and were staying in the remains of the camp, which was in a very defensible location; an attack from 3d6 wolves or whatever would have been silly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474675/#Comment_474675" name="Item_81" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-12T03:31:46+00:00" title="June 12, 2018  3:31AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, by "lose those incremental advancements if you choose certain things," do you mean, you gain the advancement then it goes away?

They also restrain their targets. One PC died right away. We had one PC roll a nat 20 on the death save, wake up, fail the strength roll to escape, and then be killed two turns later.<br/><br/>In hindsight, and it took me two days to come up with this: perhaps the vines don't start EXACTLY UNDER the PC's feet. Instead, they animate normal vines with their other magic and only when everyone is entangled they slowly creep in, with their 5' move, for the kill. That would've been better.<br/><br/>Or, they are placed in trap locations. But not just "everyone is walking in the jungle and then there's an assassin vine under EVERYONE's feet."<br/><br/>Ugh, I kinda hate that I realized this now. I thought "at least that near-TPK (one PC survived) was devoid of iffy calls, everything seemed pretty much by the book".<br/><br/>And after writing that, re-reading the encounter it also says <div class="Spoiler">that the characters might smell a dead body nearby.</div> \u2190 in vague terms, it says that there is something there. it might lure the PCs in or scare them away. I completely missed that at the table.

The Bugbear Chief, by way of comparison, isn't nearly as deadly (though it's more likely to have minions). Same with the Bearded Devil, etc. Certainly none of them is doing 21 damage a round *and* has 85 HP! That's bonkers!<br/><br/>Personally, I think the "indistinguishable from a normal plant" text both<br/><br/>(a) justifies starting the encounter where you did<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>(b) is another thing, along with that damage output, that makes the creature incredibly deadly, punching well above its purported weight class<br/><br/>I disagree that this spur of discussion isn't relevant to the OP.

It always seems to be the case that the game has excellent balance, it just so happens that I've ended up playing with the specific game elements that are somewhat less excellently balanced [grin].<br/><br/>"Oh, that adventure is notorious for being out of balance." "Oh, that monster book is no good, you should use this other one." "Oh, that build choice is depreciated."

I mean, you can kinda get away with it at the earliest levels of play but its still much better to: <br/>a) have a goal for the encounter other than "kill all the baddies" or "not get killed" (this works really well if you have both a combat encounter and a skill challenge running concurrently), and <br/>b) have either side retreat or surrender when it makes sense to do so (I use a morale system in my home game to proceduralize this process). <br/><br/>I will say this: barring some extreme outliers, an n+0 encounter in 4E (where "n" is equal to the party's level) has very, very little risk of TPK. Most of the TPKs you will hear about in 4E come from n+2 to n+4 encounters (that, or a statistically improbable string of unlucky dice rolls).<br/><br/>Still, the system isn't foolproof so a competent GM still has to look at the monsters' abilities vis a vis the abilities of the PCs (for example, if you combine a monster that slows alongside a monster with ranged area attacks, that would be tough for the players, as would monsters that weaken combined with monsters that have a high damage resistance or high hit points). \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>That said, I heard that 4e at higher levels ran into problems of the player side being \u201ctoo strong\u201d and that fights took a long time.</p><p>But that doesn\u2019t invalidate the point that the 4e DMG has clear instructions for what an encounter \u201cshould look like\u201d.</p></div></blockquote>\nCombats do take longer at higher levels (although this is true of all versions of D&amp;D and I think this particular criticism of 4E is rather exaggerated). This is why the encounter guidelines I outlined in my last post are rather important. In 4E, every encounter should matter, should have something at stake other than character death, should have more than one avenue for being resolved (such as a skill challenge), and the opposition should (usually) retreat or surrender at logical junctions to do so. All of this becomes more important the higher the level of the campaign.<br/><br/>The people running 4E like a skirmish boardgame are, in my opinion, totally missing the point.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>The key phrase here is \u201ctoss encounters at\u201d.

I present the players with a handful of bare-bones scenarios from my Crimson Lotus custom setting and, once they've picked one (or use them to come up with their own), I ask provocative questions like crazy and build upon their answers. We also make heavy use of the advice in the DMG2 so each PC comes out with Hx-like relationships with each other, a "core motivation" related to the scenario, and 1 or 2 NPCs tied to their backstories. We then come up with a quest for every one of these character elements (motivation, PC relationships, NPC relationships) which essentially function as "keys" or "flags" for the campaign (remember that quests are a major source of XP in 4E).<br/><br/>Before the next session, I write up fronts based on what we came up with in Session 0 (my current campaign has 2 major fronts and 2 minor fronts) with each one having 3 to 5 impending doom sequences. I use each impending doom as the basis for a potential encounter (around half of which are skill challenges), increasing the level of the encounter as we go up the countdown clock. So, the 3:00 threat might be a Level 1 encounter whereas the 9:00 threat would be a Level 4 encounter. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>For me, it\u2019s never about \u201cattrite them so that the BBEG fight is just right\u201d and more \u201cit\u2019s a push your luck.

No, the risk of death vs bees is a good thing, my paradigm is that it's the world as a whole that's the puzzle, that's the macro-encounter, that's the challenge. If you want to survive bees, rest up. If you want to go up vs Strahd, rest up.</div></blockquote>\nYeah, personally I hate the rest mechanics in D&amp;D and tie players refreshing their abilities to either milestones or quests. Players can also "force" an extended rest like in 13th Age, but there are fictional consequences for doing so (I progress each Front's countdown clock). <br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474694/#Comment_474694" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-12T17:07:54+00:00" title="June 12, 2018  5:07PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I'm not into 5th enough to really comment on this stuff in the substance, but I'll note that I've had a <i>lot</i> of stuff said to me about 4th edition's great game balance.

In my opinion, a lot of people making content for 4E early in its life cycle did not grok the system *at all* and were still writing adventures in a very 3.5 mindset. If you are going to draw conclusions about 4E from pre-written adventures, I would recommend Madness at Guardmore Abbey as an example of what the system can actually do (although Reavers of Harkenwold is pretty good too).<br/><br/>If you use the guidelines in the DMG as written and stay within N-2 to N+2 of the party, you'll be very hard-pressed to find a more "balanced" RPG out there.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474695/#Comment_474695" name="Item_91" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-12T17:17:09+00:00" title="June 12, 2018  5:17PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trent, your 4E approach sounds awesome.

I miss 4E <img alt=":neutral:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/neutral.png" title=":neutral:"/> <br/><br/>Regarding the AV encounter: so, I'm doing the math here. According to the DMG, that encounter is 2,100 XP worth of monsters... but counts as 4,200 worth for purposes of encounter building, because 3 monsters = multiplier of x2. Now, with 2 level 4 PCs and 1 level 3 PC, the max XP value of a Deadly encounter should be... 1,400. So this was literally 3x deadlier than a Deadly encounter! (And that's *if* we buy AVs as CR3, which I don't.) So, I mean, of course you (near-)TPK'd. That's the game working as intended.<br/><br/>But that has <i>nothing</i>, I mean nothing whatsoever, to do with the question of how often you should be able to do which types of rest.<br/><br/>Now, I recognize that a big part of your whole point here is that you don't really care about the official way of making balanced encounters or whatever, and ToA doesn't really either. I also don't XP for monsters or any of that nonsense. But I don't think it should be controversial to point out that days with only one encounter, but that one encounter may be Super Mega Deadly, is taking 5E pretty far from its intended use cases.<br/><br/>Even though I think, RAW, you made a fair call to have the AVs right under the PCs' feet, I think glancing at the encounter math in the DMG (or Xanathar's) would make it clear that you should probably give them at least a chance to back out of it rather than engaging. In other words, that specific encounter is more like a dragon in a cave or a horde of several dozen Goblins than it is a "normal" wilderness encounter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474696/#Comment_474696" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-12T17:19:27+00:00" title="June 12, 2018  5:19PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that's basically the goal with our on-coming 4th edition campaign: to take full responsibility for trying to make it the best game I can within the project's framework (most importantly, actually staying with reasonably orthodox 4th ed instead of rewriting it to my designs). This is rather different from the majority of my experience with it, which has mostly been running and playing ready-made adventure modules.

Page 157. But still</p><p>I, hmm, find them really hard to get through. I\u2019m like almost allergic to that sort of game design. Fate Core or MHR both do them better since you can be creative by creating aspects, using your pools / limits etc etc. You mechanically affect the skill challenge. 4e\u2019s skill challenges feel like bingo or candy land by comparison. Like you can flavor it yes. And you can use \u201caid another\u201d. So there\u2019s some very minor concessions.</p><p>Like\u2026 seeing the trend on youtube/reddit now about people doing 4e style skill challenges for travel breaks my heart compared to the emergent delicious play of an old school hex crawl. Hex craws are a good comparison because unlike trap finding or social situations or remembering lore, it\u2019s a part of the game where we DO use rolls heavily. Navigation, foraging, and encounter rolls. But instead of chalking up three failures, each failure has their own consequence and their own mitigation. They were using bardic inspiration on the navigation roll every morning. They did NOT want to get lost. and when the bard and the survivalists died and they started getting lost every day\u2026 hello death spiral.</p><p>They\u2019re both a good and a bad comparison. The hex crawl is similar but feels more interesting to me because every success, every failure has it\u2019s own <em>meaningful</em> fallout.</p><p>But the non-rolly ones, like the example in the RC that starts on p 162, is a good comparison because that\u2019s a situation where I wouldn\u2019t have used rolls. They would explore the site on their own and talked to NPCs on their own. Without relying on Streetwise or Diplomacy or Intimidation. And then whatever they did or didn\u2019t would have consequences of their own.</p><p>That\u2019s an example of the lack of agency with skill challenges that really frustrates me. It doesn\u2019t <em>really</em> feel like it matters what they do. They\u2019ll either succeed as a whole or fail as a whole, the diegetic outcome of entire complex situation is simplified down into either yes or no. And the mechanical nuance of the entire complex situation is reduced to just rolling.</p><p>So like some alternatives to skill challenges: if you are using 4e with Dramasystem, you can do fights as 4e skirmishes but other scenes using Dramasystem. Or, if you are using 4e with like AW/DW style free play. Or w/e.</p><p>Finally, for those who <strong>are</strong> absolutely enamored with the skill challenges framework, the 5e alternative \u201cgroup checks\u201d has math that\u2026 I\u2019m not saying WotC did or didn\u2019t finally get the math right during late 4e after all the errata and updates. But a lot of adventures and a lot of online examples still have the math wrong. The basic framework of 4e skill challenges are easy to get wonky math is what I\u2019m saying. But the 5e alternative has everyone making a roll and then if half of them make their rolls, you\u2019re golden, and if not then you\u2019ve failed. Much simpler to set up without any tables or similar, and much more intuitive probs. So the example in the RC would have the same problems of lack of interest and agency and lack of specific fallout or exploration, but you\u2019d have everyone making rolls (unlike the book, where K makes two rolls and V makes zero) and you\u2019d just see if three of them made it, you\u2019d be good. you don\u2019t have to worry about DCs, number of successes etc leading to an unexpected result. (Trent you are probably aware of the math issues plaguing skill challenges during 4e:s first year.)</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Sure, although I think you are reading waaaay too much into my choice of words [toss encounters] there.

Note that he, quite correctly, specifies that he is characterizing "fiction-focused" 4th ed., as opposed to a geekcore charop game.<br/><br/>The big, fat problem in 4th edition for many let's say Forge-trained people, myself included, is that it is demonstrably a game for the people who are willing to accept that it has a gigantic game-mechanical scale disparity between its generic conflict resolution system and its combat resolution system, yet those need to nevertheless be treated in equal terms. The game that the structuralist (somebody like myself, who perceives rpgs primarily and most naturally as frameworks of design rather than holistic experiences) sees is essentially a miniatures skirmish wargame with some flimsy pretenses of being a roleplaying game, which is not at all the experience a certain demographic has with it. In this case the game text misleads badly - and it's not the first and only example of that in the history of rpg text analysis.<br/><br/>This is something that people who actually like the game and play it have said for years, it is a constant in any reports with a whit of self-awareness that I've read: that 4th edition is a "story game" in the sense that it is story-oriented and has a lot of space for player character expression. I believe that this counter-intuitive fact (looking at the game text, I mean) comes about due to what Trent says: people have embraced the skill challenge system, which in itself is a laughably misshapen half-wit attempt at an universal extended conflict resolution system, and have made it theirs. (I think I actually have figured out how it should be used myself, too, and will be using it extensively in our forthcoming campaign; I'll write on that more at some point. It's the part of the game that absolutely <i>must</i> be fixed mechanically for the game to be playable as anything but a skirmish wargame.)<br/><br/>Once you accept that despite all indications of the game text (such as the fact that 95%+ of the game's page count are about combat) the combats are, for many people, merely 50% or less of the playtime, and that much attention is slathered in actual play on stuff like character roleplay and largely improvised action sequences within skill challenge context, the game starts to look much less like a minis wargame and much more similar to e.g. Fate - a Simulationistic princess play epic fantasy adventure game with clear railroad inclinations. It's very much the game that I'm going to be trying to capture when we try to play the <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i> with the system later this summer. Character optimization will be a minimal concern.<br/><br/>I'll close out by noting that I know many people who played 4th edition extensively through its years of publication, but that those players did <i>not</i> play in this sort of style at all - they're full-blown geekcore, running module adventures with a marked tendency for trampling over each others attempts at story values. Both styles of 4th edition D&amp;D are out there in the wild. (It's not that the circle of gamers I'm thinking of doesn't have desires to express themselves artistically; it's just that the game fits very comfortably into a certain sort of groove, and you're <i>not</i> going to break out of it just like that. They've since gotten much more satisfactory and less shallow play out of other games entirely.)<br/><br/>So yeah, it's good to know what sort of 4th edition play one is observing. It took me ages to figure out the above point, really, observing from the sidelines; the charop crowd used to be rather loud after the demise of 3rd edition, and well, you know, my background being what it is - why ever would I even consider somebody wanting to play 4th edition if they didn't want to play perfectly balanced combat encounter strings against net-proofed charop builds? There are so many games that are superficially so much more sensible for story gaming, after all, and as far as I know the 4th edition game never got a single story-oriented adventure module for it - they're all 80% combat encounter strings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21686/deconstructions-dragons" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21686/deconstructions-dragons" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21686/deconstructions-dragons/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21686/deconstructions-dragons/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21686/deconstructions-dragons/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F21686%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F21686%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Deconstructions &amp; Dragons - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21686/deconstructions-dragons/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Deconstructions &amp;amp; Dragons - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21686/deconstructions-dragons/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content='PS I hope you know that the DMG2 still has flawed math.

Page 157. But still</p><p>I, hmm, find them really hard to get through. I\u2019m like almost allergic to that sort of game design. Fate Core or MHR both do them better since you can be creative by creating aspects, using your pools / limits etc etc. You mechanically affect the skill challenge. 4e\u2019s skill challenges feel like bingo or candy land by comparison. Like you can flavor it yes. And you can use \u201caid another\u201d. So there\u2019s some very minor concessions.</p><p>Like\u2026 seeing the trend on youtube/reddit now about people doing 4e style skill challenges for travel breaks my heart compared to the emergent delicious play of an old school hex crawl. Hex craws are a good comparison because unlike trap finding or social situations or remembering lore, it\u2019s a part of the game where we DO use rolls heavily. Navigation, foraging, and encounter rolls. But instead of chalking up three failures, each failure has their own consequence and their own mitigation. They were using bardic inspiration on the navigation roll every morning. They did NOT want to get lost. and when the bard and the survivalists died and they started getting lost every day\u2026 hello death spiral.</p><p>They\u2019re both a good and a bad comparison. The hex crawl is similar but feels more interesting to me because every success, every failure has it\u2019s own <em>meaningful</em> fallout.</p><p>But the non-rolly ones, like the example in the RC that starts on p 162, is a good comparison because that\u2019s a situation where I wouldn\u2019t have used rolls. They would explore the site on their own and talked to NPCs on their own. Without relying on Streetwise or Diplomacy or Intimidation. And then whatever they did or didn\u2019t would have consequences of their own.</p><p>That\u2019s an example of the lack of agency with skill challenges that really frustrates me. It doesn\u2019t <em>really</em> feel like it matters what they do. They\u2019ll either succeed as a whole or fail as a whole, the diegetic outcome of entire complex situation is simplified down into either yes or no. And the mechanical nuance of the entire complex situation is reduced to just rolling.</p><p>So like some alternatives to skill challenges: if you are using 4e with Dramasystem, you can do fights as 4e skirmishes but other scenes using Dramasystem. Or, if you are using 4e with like AW/DW style free play. Or w/e.</p></div></blockquote>\nOkay, there's a lot to unpack here. Let me just make a few brief points:<br/><br/>1) I definitely don't use skill challenges for every situation in the game. There's a time and place for them and, in my opinion, that's when its a high-stakes situation that involves multiple PCs interacting with a *dynamic* challenge and at least one or more "moving parts" that complicates the challenge. If you're approach to skill challenges is "just make 4 Stealth checks before 3 failures" its going to suck. A lot. Just do a group skill check instead. Skill challenges are the non-combat equivalent of 4E's combat encounters, which will also suck if you if you took such a one-dimensional approach to designing them ("hah, 4 orc warriors in a 30' by 30' room with nothing in it!").<br/><br/>2) You are grossly oversimplifying 4E's skill challenge system, which is why I specifically referenced the DMG2 (although Star Wars Saga Edition also had supplement that addressed them as well). They are not all X checks before 3 failures (which, in my opinion, are the lamest version of the skill challenge). There are also open-ended skill challenges, contested skill challenges, multi-phase skill challenges, and other such complications (such as certain skills only working a limited number of times in the challenge).<br/><br/>3) Each failure *should* matter in a skill challenge and *should* have consequences. I have yet to run a skill challenge where this was not this case, and this was years before I came across games like Dungeon World.<br/><br/>4) In my own games, I will jot down notes about which skills may be primary or secondary in a challenge but these are just guidelines. I also allow liberal use of character powers and Rule 42 to contribute to the challenge. The rigid approach you are describing here, is in my opinion, anathema to the Always Say Yes spirit of 4E.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Finally, for those who <strong>are</strong> absolutely enamored with the skill challenges framework, the 5e alternative \u201cgroup checks\u201d has math that\u2026 I\u2019m not saying WotC did or didn\u2019t finally get the math right during late 4e after all the errata and updates. But a lot of adventures and a lot of online examples still have the math wrong. The basic framework of 4e skill challenges are easy to get wonky math is what I\u2019m saying. But the 5e alternative has everyone making a roll and then if half of them make their rolls, you\u2019re golden, and if not then you\u2019ve failed. Much simpler to set up without any tables or similar, and much more intuitive probs. So the example in the RC would have the same problems of lack of interest and agency and lack of specific fallout or exploration, but you\u2019d have everyone making rolls (unlike the book, where K makes two rolls and V makes zero) and you\u2019d just see if three of them made it, you\u2019d be good. you don\u2019t have to worry about DCs, number of successes etc leading to an unexpected result.

In fact, I distinctly remember a few skill challenges from Dungeon magazine that had group checks in them *in addition* to individual checks.<br/><br/>Again, though, there is a time and place to use group checks and a time and place to use skill challenges. Skill challenges should be for dynamic, complex, or multi-phased situations. They are also something of a pacing mechanism and, in some respects, are to non-combat situations what hit points are to combat situations.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But it\u2019s not just that phrase, it\u2019s the way you set up encounters specifically to be encounters.

Based on my own experience running and playing 4E, skill challenges are at the very heart and soul of a fiction-focused 4E campaign. Many of the strategies I've discussed in this thread are difficult to do without skill challenges and there is a very real danger of the game devolving into tactical skirmish after tactical skirmish if the only resolution system that engages the whole group is combat encounters.</p></div></blockquote>\nI agree with everything Trent here says. Note that he, quite correctly, specifies that he is characterizing "fiction-focused" 4th ed., as opposed to a geekcore charop game.<br/><br/>The big, fat problem in 4th edition for many let's say Forge-trained people, myself included, is that it is demonstrably a game for the people who are willing to accept that it has a gigantic game-mechanical scale disparity between its generic conflict resolution system and its combat resolution system, yet those need to nevertheless be treated in equal terms. The game that the structuralist (somebody like myself, who perceives rpgs primarily and most naturally as frameworks of design rather than holistic experiences) sees is essentially a miniatures skirmish wargame with some flimsy pretenses of being a roleplaying game, which is not at all the experience a certain demographic has with it. In this case the game text misleads badly - and it's not the first and only example of that in the history of rpg text analysis.<br/><br/>This is something that people who actually like the game and play it have said for years, it is a constant in any reports with a whit of self-awareness that I've read: that 4th edition is a "story game" in the sense that it is story-oriented and has a lot of space for player character expression. I believe that this counter-intuitive fact (looking at the game text, I mean) comes about due to what Trent says: people have embraced the skill challenge system, which in itself is a laughably misshapen half-wit attempt at an universal extended conflict resolution system, and have made it theirs. (I think I actually have figured out how it should be used myself, too, and will be using it extensively in our forthcoming campaign; I'll write on that more at some point. It's the part of the game that absolutely <i>must</i> be fixed mechanically for the game to be playable as anything but a skirmish wargame.)<br/><br/>Once you accept that despite all indications of the game text (such as the fact that 95%+ of the game's page count are about combat) the combats are, for many people, merely 50% or less of the playtime, and that much attention is slathered in actual play on stuff like character roleplay and largely improvised action sequences within skill challenge context, the game starts to look much less like a minis wargame and much more similar to e.g. Fate - a Simulationistic princess play epic fantasy adventure game with clear railroad inclinations. It's very much the game that I'm going to be trying to capture when we try to play the <i>Chronicles of Prydain</i> with the system later this summer. Character optimization will be a minimal concern.<br/><br/>I'll close out by noting that I know many people who played 4th edition extensively through its years of publication, but that those players did <i>not</i> play in this sort of style at all - they're full-blown geekcore, running module adventures with a marked tendency for trampling over each others attempts at story values. Both styles of 4th edition D&amp;D are out there in the wild. (It's not that the circle of gamers I'm thinking of doesn't have desires to express themselves artistically; it's just that the game fits very comfortably into a certain sort of groove, and you're <i>not</i> going to break out of it just like that. They've since gotten much more satisfactory and less shallow play out of other games entirely.)<br/><br/>So yeah, it's good to know what sort of 4th edition play one is observing. It took me ages to figure out the above point, really, observing from the sidelines; the charop crowd used to be rather loud after the demise of 3rd edition, and well, you know, my background being what it is - why ever would I even consider somebody wanting to play 4th edition if they didn't want to play perfectly balanced combat encounter strings against net-proofed charop builds? There are so many games that are superficially so much more sensible for story gaming, after all, and as far as I know the 4th edition game never got a single story-oriented adventure module for it - they're all 80% combat encounter strings.</div></blockquote>\nHi Eero,<br/><br/>Yes, very good. Its actually pretty interesting because 4E was the first game I ran as a GM and I pretty much used it the way I'm describing almost out of the box. Like, we'd run combat encounters by the book and all but I'd handwave a lot of stuff, wouldn't bother to count squares, and so on. It wasn't until I started drawing upon published material from WotC that my game got muddled up with that "geekcore" stuff you talk about.<br/><br/>Like, to me, based upon my reading of the DMG and stuff I heard from like-minded players on places like ENWorld I thought I was running 4E the way it was intended to be run. A lot of the CharOp stuff was just over my head and didn't interest me or my circle of players at all.<br/><br/>(By the way, I love your terminology for some of this stuff. "Geekcore" and "Princess Play". Hah!)<br/><br/>I wouldn't look down on skill challenges as "half-witted" or "misshapen" too much (although its easy to get that impression from the DMG1). I really strongly recommend getting your hands on the DMG2 if you haven't already and even that SWSE supplement whose name eludes me at the moment but has something about "intrigue" in it. There is a LOT you can do with skill challenges (I have replaced whole "combats" with them on occasion) and it evolved into a pretty flexible and robust system as the edition cycle matured.<br/><br/>There was a reason a lot of 4E players flocked to 13th Age when it came out. It inherited a lot of the same story-oriented improvisational play.<br/><br/>~ Trent<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474729">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474729/#Comment_474729" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-13T20:11:15+00:00" title="June 13, 2018  8:11PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>When I ran 4th I definitely drew heavily on my Mouse Guard experience and other story games knowledge to make Skill Challenges work at all.

I had zero experience with indie games prior to 4E (it was actually what sparked my interest in them!) and zero experience being a GM, but skill challenges worked pretty well for me out of the gate. Of course, they worked even better when the DMG2 came out and some of the online discussion surrounding them matured, but that's that.<br/><br/>I will say I often had trouble making skill challenges sing in social/conversational situations. I wouldn't use them for that approach unless there were some significant moving parts or complications (an opposed skill challenge competing with a group of NPCs trying to convince the local baron to imprison you sounds like fun). Otherwise just let the party face do all the talking.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474730">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474730/#Comment_474730" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-13T20:46:45+00:00" title="June 13, 2018  8:46PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to hear, in some detail, what a great 4E skill challenge looks like (and what failures effect in play).

I think those are pretty solid. Otherwise, here are some guidelines and examples for you to chew on:<br/><br/><a href="https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/511098/dm-tips-how-to-run-a-skill-challenge-d-and-d-4e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/511098/dm-tips-how-to-run-a-skill-challenge-d-and-d-4e</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.runagame.net/2013/08/4e-skill-challenge-example.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.runagame.net/2013/08/4e-skill-challenge-example.html</a><br/><br/>As for my own games, here is one of the more memorable skill challenges I've used in the past:<br/><br/>SKILL CHALLENGE 1: ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT<br/><br/>The PCs are protecting the leader of a friendly elven enclave who is the target of an assassination attempt from a small group of drow assassins.<br/>- Complexity 2: the PCs must make 6 successes before 3 failures<br/>- Description: The PCs must take out all the assassins before they take out the elven leader. A successful secondary skill check reveals the location of an assassin and gives +2 to a primary skill check directed at that assassin. A successful primary skill check takes out an assassin and counts as 1 success toward the challenge (if the PCs beat the DC by 5 or more it counts as 2 successes).<br/>- Primary Skills: Athletics (you tackle and overpower the assassin), Acrobatics (you outmaneuver and disarm the assassin), Arcana (you use your magicks to defeat the assassin), Diplomacy (you convince one of the elven guards you know where an assassin is), Intimidate (you cower the assassin into surrendering)<br/>- Secondary Skills: Insight, Perception, Streetwise (you figure out an assassin's location)<br/>- Skill DCs: base the DC of the check on the player's description and fictional positioning<br/>- Primary Failures: On the first failure, the elven leader is injured. On the second, he is bloodied. On the third and final failure, he is killed. On any primary failure, the target assassin escapes and becomes hidden again.<br/>- Secondary Failures: The PC approximates an assassin's whereabouts but is unsure of the exact location. The primary skill check is made with a -2 penalty.<br/>- XP: In terms of XP, this skill challenge is equivalent to an easy combat encounter of the PCs' level.<br/><br/>I don't know about "great", but we had a lot of fun doing this one. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>~ Trent<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474735/#Comment_474735" name="Item_112" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-14T00:38:22+00:00" title="June 14, 2018 12:38AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2018 12:38AM by Trent_W.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>But I was referring to the extended example in the RC.

I don't think the examples in the RC are particularly great. Its pretty much just a bare-bones introduction to the system without a more nuanced discussion of the complexities of skill challenges. Definitely a product of the post-Essentials push for "simplicity" at the expense of quality.<br/><br/>I would recommend people interested in learning about skill challenges to check out the material in 4E's DMG2 and SWSE's Galaxies of Intrigue. Or, if you want a more recent example, Blades in the Dark's clocks. Since they're pretty much the same thing.<br/><br/>As to the whole "working math" thing, I have the DCs from the Dungeon Master's Kit which are the same as the RC, but in my opinion the whole "broken math" thing was hugely blown out of proportion and is an example of that geekcore culture Eero was describing a few posts back.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>So what makes Fate Core, Diaspora and MHR different is that it\u2019s not just a matter of \u201cfiguring out applicable skills, esp ones where I have good stats\u201d &amp; \u201chaving good dice luck\u201d.

Since they also have an XP value, a skill challenge can also be added to a combat encounter to give a more dynamic quality to the encounter (you just add the challenge's XP value to determine the total encounter's XP budget).<br/><br/>Do you absolutely need skill challenges? No, just like you don't need hit points, monster stat blocks, XP, initiative, or a dozen other things that exist in roleplaying games. These things exist to give *structure* and *pacing* for GMs that want a little boxes with their clouds.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>Let\u2019s define what a 4e skill challenge is, I\u2019m not married to any particular definition.</p><ol><li>You make X successes to succeed</li><li>You make Y (well, usually 3) fails to fail.</li><li>Fictional positioning, rather than a preset list, is used to determine which character abilities and skills can create successes.</li><li>Mechanical choices don\u2019t mechanically influence future gameplay in the skill challenge, with a few exceptions such as aid another, some of the \u201cadvantages\u201d, and fictional positioning.

I tend to use this format the least.<br/><br/>Obviously, Number 4 isn't remotely true.

It's basically the same system that <i>Trollbabe</i> uses, for instance. Or <i>Zombie Cinema</i> for that matter, if you want to look at it like that. I could do a write-up on it that would be no worse than anything a good story game has, and that'd still be 80% RAW.<br/><br/>When you strip out all the geekcore murk, the basic principles are rather elegant, I think:<br/><b>*</b> You need X successes to win, as a formal condition that informs the way we narrate the situation. The presence of this objective count provides the real conflict resolution benefit for improvised action sequences: you are able to say "not yet" or "now's the time" as regards continuing or stopping the narrating by checking on the victory condition. Essentially, the system is perfect for princess play conflict resolution because it makes progress tracking objectively visible and independent of the narrative color.<br/><b>*</b> The individual dice rolls or other activities taken to amass those successes are negotiated in a loose framework that may, devoid of geekcore spazzing, be surprisingly fiction-based, consensual and intuitive: the GM assigns difficulty classing (easy/mediocre/hard) based on the specific activities attempted, for instance, which is all you really need for a simple circumstance bonus/penalty system. The turn-order is similarly loosely fiction-based - "to do it, do it", within certain obvious limits of sportsmanship.<br/><b>*</b> The smart chicken drops much of the haphazard "when you lose" stuff involved in most writeups of the system and just focuses heavily on the concept of paying a penalty for failed checks, with the implication that you lose if you fail to amass the needed success count before you're too tired to continue. I'm probably just going to go "you fail a check, you're out of the conflict - or you pay a healing surge" much of the time myself. The system works best if "failure" is primarily "how much resources you're willing to pay to win", at least when it comes to the sort of princess play plot railroad I'm envisioning. (Incidentally, "how much you're willing to pay to win" is also a narrativist core mechanism; very fundamental.)<br/><br/>(That aforementioned smart chicken will also notice that this is not a new system: it's the old stand-by of task resolution systems, often called the "extended resolution system" or similar by different games. The core idea is that you make several skill checks on a row, counting up successes, until you either fail in some way or amass enough to complete the project. It was already commonplace in traditional games in the late '80s for resolving long-term projects that characters might undertake, although always only as a side-note due to how a classical task resolution system only uses this sort of technique for, well, extended projects.)<br/><br/>This may not be for everyone and every situation, but I repeat: it is no worse than <i>Fate</i> or <i>Heroquest</i> or <i>Swords Without Master</i> or other story games that use extended conflict resolution action sequences. You need rules that allow the players to essentially draft action choreography freely, do some rough ball-park gauging on what constitutes a "good response" (which the difficulty classing of rolls does here), but that also tell you clearly when to stop and who won; the skill challenge rules deliver in this regard, even if they fail at selling themselves if you compare them to how actual story games explain these types of rules. If the game didn't have that stupid skirmish combat system bolted-on, who knows how popular it might've been [grin].<br/><br/>Conclusion: it seems to me that this is one of those cases where it is simultaneously true that skill challenges are sucky and that they are good; it depends heavily on the particulars of the execution, and it can easily go either way depending on how you read and implement the rules. This is far from unique as a phenomenon of rpg history, D&amp;D alone has lots of features in its history that have failed for some and worked well for others. If you don't need the functionality that skill challenges provide, then <i>of course</i> you're not going to appreciate what the system has going for it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474739/#Comment_474739" name="Item_114" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-14T06:27:57+00:00" title="June 14, 2018  6:27AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2018 6:37AM by 2097.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Look, skill challenges are a tool for giving GMs structure and pacing to non-combat encounters and also a means of giving concrete XP and milestone rewards for doing something other than killing stuff.</p></div></blockquote><p>Oh, giving out XP for other things, I do that too.</p> <blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" rel="nofollow">Trent_W</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Do you absolutely need skill challenges?

(Which is why it's so disappointing that WotC didn't give it more thought / explanation.) Because otherwise, <i>most combats in 5E suck and are boring</i>. They last 2-3 rounds, and the PCs are in no real danger. (This is assuming the PCs are facing anything *like* level-appropriate challenges.) But the PCs will, normally, blow at least some resources that can't be recovered except via long or maybe medium rest.<br/><br/>So when there's no uncertainty at all about resting, or about whether or not there'll be another fight before a rest happens, the game just becomes kind of anodyne, for anyone like me who can see beyond the immediate moment to the broader structures of the game.<br/><br/>And yeah, Sandra, I've seen that Mike Mearls thing before, about how the combat system should always function when the PCs are at full HP / spells / etc. And I mean, that's obviously true, from a design perspective. The really interesting question is, at what point of PC <i>depletion</i> does the combat system stop functioning?<br/><br/>Also, Dave... regarding your concerns that this whole resting thing isn't fun enough "to bother with"... I mean, what's the alternative? Just not have depletion of resources? Players can rest literally whenever they want? Or it's just totally predictable, 13th Age-style? (You get a full rest every 4 encounters, period, no matter what's going on in the fiction.

Even then, I still find 5e tedious as a DM because of the reasons listed: needless numerical bloat, a leveling treadmill, bland combats, and encounter-solving-spells.

We're still doing the one-hour thing but I've been kinda envious at the 4e 5min short rest.<br/><br/>Val, 5e has the least treadmill of all editions. Compared to something like LotFP where the fighter goes +1 every single level.<br/><br/>I haven't had any probs running sandbox (well, perhaps overlethal) b/c the party can self-pace. It's up to them whether to go down a dungeon level or to pick fights with soldiers. So I agree with your solution.<br/><br/>My view of the blandness is that it's a fast system and what matters is at least as much "what you bring to bear" as it is about round-by-round choices. Picking off zombs in a snipe fight vs being dragged under by a crocodile. Building dex or str. Using your bardic insp well. Again, compared to OSR games it's not bland. Or, make it more like DW. Throw out that initiative system and bring down chaos. We had a DW fight over two stories of a burning building. And, ditching the init system also means that the line between exploration mode and fighting is <i>gone</i>. A sleep or laughter spell to bypass a fight, or throwing a punch in a conversation... it becomes less of a Let's Do The Fight Now and more like fucking guerilla tactics. In the Lost Mines, I had four giant spiders stalk them, pick them off one by one as they were exploring. Giant spiders are weak but this became very memorable.<br/><br/>But. If none of that helps... go look for some story monsters or trap monsters. The oblex from Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes or the Navarch of AaXt from Fire on the Velvet Horizon. Seeing the city you're in roll up on itself and be hurled through hell as you're fighting your way through moon apes and chain devils is not that bland.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474761/#Comment_474761" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T06:22:50+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  6:22AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Especially encounter-solving spells go from problematic to cool with this approach.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474773/#Comment_474773" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T14:09:13+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  2:09PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2018 2:09PM by David_Berg.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Also, Dave... regarding your concerns that this whole resting thing isn't fun enough "to bother with"...

Linking together a certain number of encounters with no opportunities for rests, basically.  <br/><br/>A lot of my OSR dungeon experience was like that.  <br/><br/>I was actually wondering if that's what you were going for with your concentric half-tiers in 4E, like, if you can only rest at Home Base, and at any given moment you know how many tiers of what difficulty separate you from Home Base, you can judge the risks of pressing on accordingly.<br/><br/>The most rewarding recuperation-management game I've ever played was the long OSR dungeon crawl, where the treasure is at the dungeon's heart, and the more you deplete your resources as you approach the heart, the more you worry about being unable to make it all the way there (or there and back) intact.  The dungeons were very difficult, and cutting your losses was not infrequently the correct call.  Fortunately, the difficulty of <i>leaving</i> the dungeon prevented over-cautious play (I say "fortunately" because leaving <i>every</i> dungeon where a TPK was a risk would have drained all excitement).  There was at least one memorable dungeon where killing the big bad at the dungeon's heart <i>enabled</i> you to leave without further trouble.  So for that one, we really pushed it in our effort to beat the dungeon.<br/><br/><small>(As it turned out, we failed!  A Grey Philosopher was beyond our abilities as a mostly 3rd-level party with a bunch of 1st-level help.  With a few unconscious party members, we fled the heart of the dungeon, and two more of us dropped from further hits from other dungeon critters on the way out.  At first I was disappointed that we didn't beat the dungeon, but in the end I was just relieved that we got out of the dungeon with no TPK.)</small> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana" title="ValyrianSteelKatana"><img alt="ValyrianSteelKatana" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ValyrianSteelKatana">ValyrianSteelKatana</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474791/#Comment_474791" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-15T21:40:28+00:00" title="June 15, 2018  9:40PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/2097">@2097</a>:\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Val, 5e has the least treadmill of all editions.</p></div></blockquote>\nIt has the least treadmill in terms of numerical bonuses (good), but the hit point bloat is still prominent (bad).

I'll explain why this is the case, I believe some will find this interesting:<br/><br/>As we know, hit points increase linearly as a function of level: one die per level, about 3.5 points or whatever on average. This means that the <i>proportional impact</i> that the hit point increase each level has on your total lessens as levels grow, right? That 3.5 points means a great deal at 2nd level, while at level 10 it's meaningless in any immediate sense.<br/><br/>Besides, hit points do not cause illusory progress: the arbitrarily rising damage ratings do, as game designers attempt to maintain low level combat dynamics for characters with large amounts of hit points.<br/><br/>The old orthodox handling of name level and high level mechanics is strange in many ways: while you stop gaining HD, you do still gain a few hit points every level. Meanwhile, the geometric increase of the XP limit stops and becomes linear instead. This means that while your HD gain per level goes down a little bit, the actual HP increase may in fact speed up, depending on what high level play is like for a given group. A post-name level character might need e.g. "just" 100 000 XP to level and gain that +1 HP or whatever, compared to the half a million points they needed for name level.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>What, then, is the immediate mechanical cause of illusory progress in D&amp;D? I would argue that it's arbitrarily increasing attack bonuses/defenses (a meaningless race if any is) and damage dice. Discard those and the system actually has meaningful baselines again, against which character progress then becomes relevant. HD will measure, on average, how many hits a character can survive in combat, because both hit dice and hit points are on the d6 - or in the ballpark anyway.<br/><br/>(If somebody really wants to do this and hasn't, I have one bit of advice: don't try to second-guess what will happen at higher levels. Just play. Add those HD to the characters, see hit points go up. Don't add ever-more extra special weapons and armor all the time, be conservative about the ways in which monsters and heroes grow in power over levels. Then, when you <i>see</i> the emergent game, add rules to taste to make the high-level play look the way it should. Probably high-level characters have something more effective than a hit roll for d6 damage to offer each other; figure out what that is when you get there, and for fuck's sake, make it something more interesting than "all the numbers go up in a carefully calibrated sequence to ensure that nothing about the game experience ever changes". That whole idea was where D&amp;D went wrong historically, I think.)<br/><br/>Magic rules, of course, were what drove the innovation originally in the direction it went: when something like <i>Fireball</i> exists as a conceit in your mechanical landscape, that entire concept of playing against the baseline becomes rather suspect. Save-or-die effects, particularly in the hands of the players, did not help in keeping things real.<br/><br/>__<br/><br/>I might as well put down a simple little D&amp;D math hack. Do the following simple things, or something similar, to your favourite flavour of old D&amp;D to remove the open-ended grind pit mechanics from the game once and for all:<br/><b>*</b> AC starts at 10 and goes down. Attack rolls are roll-equal-or-below AC on d20. Attack bonus goes up, but you don't add it to your attack roll; instead, any roll of your own attack bonus or under is a "double hit" or "critical hit". If the same roll is both over AC and under the hit bonus (common in mid-to-high level play), it's a normal hit. Process attacks by declaring the roll, with both the attacker and defender declaring hit or miss against their own target numbers (AC and hit bonus respectively).<br/><b>*</b> Damage on hit is d6. Whenever the system tells you that there should be more damage (such as <i>Fireball</i>), or you just feel like it for whatever reason, roll however many dice and pick the highest instead of summing them. A series of the same number on the damage dice grants +1 to the damage, so two fives is a six and three sixes is an eight and so on. A critical hit scores as two separate normal hits, so essentially double damage.<br/><b>*</b> Make your peace with save-or-die effects. There's been much discussion of various solutions, so whatever works for you is fine. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I recommend just removing them all: spells and monsters that do a save-or-die instead do [level]+d6 damage, and those doing save-or-suck let the target choose to take the damage instead of the effect.<br/><b>*</b> Get rid of healing magic, it's a cancer. Natural healing rates are fine as they are in all versions of D&amp;D. Perhaps let a healing spell heal its level in HP if you like the idea of clerics - I chose the number intentionally to prevent healing magic from doing the job it does in orthodox rules.<br/><br/>The purpose of these four changes is to put a nasty mechanical lock on the runaway D&amp;D math at a foundational level. This is what many better-designed new games do: they guarantee mechanically reasonable outcomes by making it really difficult to input the wrong values into the game's math.<br/><br/>You'll note that using the above basic concepts makes certain types of mechanical inflation much less of an issue than is traditional, and when numbers do increase that increase is always non-linear and meaningful. Traditional treadmill elements (bigger wounds vs. bigger heals, bigger armor vs. bigger attacks, etc.) are done away with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474799">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474799/#Comment_474799" name="Item_125" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-16T07:13:18+00:00" title="June 16, 2018  7:13AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero, they ALREADY ditched the rising defenses and attack bonuses in 5e.

Which some hate and some -- like me -- absolutely love.<br/><br/>In terms of damage, some classes (ranger, fighter, warlock) get more attacks/spells, some get more damaging attacks/spells (assassin, evoker), some get more powerful debuffs and SoS (sleep spell, turn undead).<br/><br/>This hp/damage increase (which as you note is proportionally diminishing) means one dragon is mechanically different from one goblin. Of course a game could be designed where that's not the case. Where the differentiation of the opposition is only on the fictional layer. Personally, the mechanical game of D&amp;D does appeal to me.

It's basically the same system that <i>Trollbabe</i> uses, for instance. Or <i>Zombie Cinema</i> for that matter, if you want to look at it like that. I could do a write-up on it that would be no worse than anything a good story game has, and that'd still be 80% RAW.<br/><br/>When you strip out all the geekcore murk, the basic principles are rather elegant, I think:<br/><b>*</b> You need X successes to win, as a formal condition that informs the way we narrate the situation. The presence of this objective count provides the real conflict resolution benefit for improvised action sequences: you are able to say "not yet" or "now's the time" as regards continuing or stopping the narrating by checking on the victory condition. Essentially, the system is perfect for princess play conflict resolution because it makes progress tracking objectively visible and independent of the narrative color.<br/><b>*</b> The individual dice rolls or other activities taken to amass those successes are negotiated in a loose framework that may, devoid of geekcore spazzing, be surprisingly fiction-based, consensual and intuitive: the GM assigns difficulty classing (easy/mediocre/hard) based on the specific activities attempted, for instance, which is all you really need for a simple circumstance bonus/penalty system. The turn-order is similarly loosely fiction-based - "to do it, do it", within certain obvious limits of sportsmanship.<br/><b>*</b> The smart chicken drops much of the haphazard "when you lose" stuff involved in most writeups of the system and just focuses heavily on the concept of paying a penalty for failed checks, with the implication that you lose if you fail to amass the needed success count before you're too tired to continue. I'm probably just going to go "you fail a check, you're out of the conflict - or you pay a healing surge" much of the time myself. The system works best if "failure" is primarily "how much resources you're willing to pay to win", at least when it comes to the sort of princess play plot railroad I'm envisioning. (Incidentally, "how much you're willing to pay to win" is also a narrativist core mechanism; very fundamental.)<br/><br/>(That aforementioned smart chicken will also notice that this is not a new system: it's the old stand-by of task resolution systems, often called the "extended resolution system" or similar by different games. The core idea is that you make several skill checks on a row, counting up successes, until you either fail in some way or amass enough to complete the project. It was already commonplace in traditional games in the late '80s for resolving long-term projects that characters might undertake, although always only as a side-note due to how a classical task resolution system only uses this sort of technique for, well, extended projects.)<br/><br/>This may not be for everyone and every situation, but I repeat: it is no worse than <i>Fate</i> or <i>Heroquest</i> or <i>Swords Without Master</i> or other story games that use extended conflict resolution action sequences. You need rules that allow the players to essentially draft action choreography freely, do some rough ball-park gauging on what constitutes a "good response" (which the difficulty classing of rolls does here), but that also tell you clearly when to stop and who won; the skill challenge rules deliver in this regard, even if they fail at selling themselves if you compare them to how actual story games explain these types of rules. If the game didn't have that stupid skirmish combat system bolted-on, who knows how popular it might've been [grin].<br/><br/>Conclusion: it seems to me that this is one of those cases where it is simultaneously true that skill challenges are sucky and that they are good; it depends heavily on the particulars of the execution, and it can easily go either way depending on how you read and implement the rules. This is far from unique as a phenomenon of rpg history, D&amp;D alone has lots of features in its history that have failed for some and worked well for others. If you don't need the functionality that skill challenges provide, then <i>of course</i> you're not going to appreciate what the system has going for it.</p></div></blockquote>\nHi Eero, great insights as always. Earlier today I actually ran the first session of my modded 4E campaign War of the Blue Chrysanthemum. It was the first time I've ran a skill challenge in a few years with mostly hacks of Apocalypse World and Blades in the Dark taking up my gaming experience in recent memory. A few things I took away from today:<br/><br/>1) It was basic, mostly improvised Complexity 1 "make 4 successes before 3 failures" type of challenge with 2 PCs involved. It was actually precisely the sort of skill challenge I've struggled with implementing in the past, a social/conversational challenge where the PCs had to convince a handful of guards that they were not up to no good (they most definitely were) and to let them pass. Given that, I was curious how my experience with this type of skill challenge may differ from my past attempts.<br/><br/>2) Your "not yet" vs "now's the time" description totally hit the nail on the head. Every time one of the characters failed a primary roll, it was a signal for me as the GM to escalate the situation while still maintaining the overall conflict. In AW, I would have probably resolved a similar situation with a single roll but the accumulating failed rolls in 4E really helped to ramp up the sense of tension and made the stakes more dire as things progressed.<br/><br/>3) I usually improvise the consequences of failed rolls, but like you my go to is typically "it costs you a healing surge" --- which is a very reasonable consequence as these are supposed to have the same weight as combat encounters. This particular challenge costed one PC 2 surges and the other PC 1 surge (they failed the challenge, obviously). However, I also think something like a list of GM moves is very helpful here and I usually combine these with the healing surge loss.<br/><br/>4) Absolutely agree about the mixed results from 4E's explanation of skill challenges as a working system. In my opinion, only the DMG2 does a decent job of this. Both the DMG1 and the DMK/RC fail to adequately "sell" the system to the players.<br/><br/>5) I've had some thoughts about that "bolted-on stupid skirmish system" in regards to its relationship with skill challenges. I think it helps a fiction-focused 4E game immensely to make combats feel more like skill challenges and there's a few things I'm toying with in doing just that:<br/>- Totally dropping any kind of formal initiative system (similar to what Sandra is doing with her 5E game).<br/>- Instead of tracking the opposition's individual hit points I'm thinking about tracking "successes" like I would in a skill challenge, with each creature of the same type sharing a "success pool" (similar to how mooks work in 13th Age). Minions require 1 success, standards 3 successes, elites 6 successes, and solos 12 successes. So a fight with 4 orc grunts (minions) and 2 orc warriors (standards) would have 2 separate "success pools": a "4 success pool" for the orc grunts and a "6 success pool" for the orc warriors. If a PC does damage greater or equal to 1/2 the creature's bloodied value, it counts as 2 successes instead of 1.<br/>- Rather than having opposing creatures roll to hit, I am thinking about setting up their attacks as soft moves and give individual PCs a chance to respond. If the PC isn't able to stop the creature from doing what its trying to do, I'll have the attack go off as if the creature rolled a natural 10 on the d20 (but still roll for damage).<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474883">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474883/#Comment_474883" name="Item_127" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-18T03:27:28+00:00" title="June 18, 2018  3:27AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra!\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Oh, giving out XP for other things, I do that too.</p></div></blockquote>\nSure, but the thing I'm really pointing to here is the elegant way 4E's encounter design rules feed back into its XP reward rules. In 4E, the things the PCs come up against have levels --- whether monster, trap, hazard, or skill challenge --- so every Level 1 Standard threat in 4E is worth 100 XP, for example. So you can mix and match encounters with any of these elements, combining monsters or hazards or skill challenges as you see best fits the fictional situation, and still have working XP budgets with which to gauge things. <br/><br/>(This also ties into what we were talking about at the beginning of the thread, with threats of a given level having reasonable ballpark stats the GM can use (attack bonus, hit points, defense, damage, etc).) <br/><br/>The point is that precisely because of the way that 4E sets up skill challenges they are exactly as valuable as a combat of a comparable complexity and level in terms of the XP reward cycles in the game. \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Well then!

Its a modified version of a skill challenge I ran across online several years ago. I did make a few changes to the original though.<br/><br/>One thing I forgot to add is that a nearby PC has the option of "taking the arrow" for the elven leader. So, the first fail they'd take surge value in damage, second fail would be bloodied value in damage, and third fail would flat out kill them. None of my players were so attached to the elf to attempt this option, however. <img alt=":wink:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=":wink:"/> <br/><br/>I didn't mechanically explain the challenge to them, no. In general, I usually don't tell my players they're in a skill challenge and just describe things in terms of fictional positioning.

Comparing them to individual skill checks is kind of missing the point. They fill the same gameplay space as combats do.<br/><br/>Secondly, it still sounds like you are grossly oversimplifying skill challenges. There is a lot players can do to mess around with the chances of success in a skill challenge. Secondary skills can give bonuses to other player's rolls or remove failures in the challenge, depending on both the individual skill and how the challenge is designed. Powers can give bonuses to primary rolls as well (commonly encounter powers grant +2 and daily powers grant +5) or give extra successes. Rolling well enough above a DC can grant extra successes as well (which synergizes well with secondary skills giving bonuses to rolls).  Open-ended skill challenges don't even have macro-failure states and simply keep going until the player's succeed (or run out of healing surges).<br/><br/>All I can tell you, Sandra, is that I have a lot of experience running skill challenges in 4E and 13th Age and the scenes that involved them almost always were our most memorable, enjoyable experiences in those games. Several times I have had players turn to me after we resolved the challenge and tell me how awesome that encounter was. This was a consistent factor in the games I've run. Skill challenges are a very powerful tool *if* you approach them with the right mindset and embrace what they bring to the table.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Having interesting and relevant fallout, with fine granularity as per DitV (and, as per D&amp;D\u2019s fight system, where a fight sometimes costs you slots, sometimes hit dice, sometimes characters), is a way to mitigate that feeling of futility and pointlessness.</p></div></blockquote>\nA well-run skill challenge should have all those things, as well.

The strongest, most dynamic encounters in 4E will include more than one type of challenge --- combat + hazard or combat + skill challenge or skill challenge + hazard --- and this feeds back into the game's reward cycles, especially when you factor into XP from quests (particularly if said quests are player-authored as both the PHB and DMG explicitly give allowance for).  \n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/2097" rel="nofollow">2097</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p></p><p>The thing is that skill challenges don\u2019t have levels in 5e because DCs don\u2019t increase.

A wooden door doesn't suddenly have a higher DC because the PCs have gone up in level.<br/><br/>~ Trent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474977">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474977/#Comment_474977" name="Item_133" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-20T20:55:48+00:00" title="June 20, 2018  8:55PM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 20, 2018 10:31PM by Trent_W.">edited June 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/komradebob" rel="nofollow">komradebob</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Please do a thread about that last bit!</p></div></blockquote>\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21710/hacking-4es-combat-engine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/21710/hacking-4es-combat-engine</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474983/#Comment_474983" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-21T06:29:22+00:00" title="June 21, 2018  6:29AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So my point re the Eero/Fate thing was that it was presented as if I was unaware that other games do this while I was the one that brought it up in the first place that other games do this. And how I thought the other games did it better.<br/><br/>So my point with the conflict/task resolution thing was that <b>since</b> they are packaged up into conflict level resolution, the probability of success on <i>that</i> level is suddenly relevant, suddenly unintuitive, and suddenly important.<br/><br/>So my point about the door thing wasn't that <b>wooden</b> doors suddenly got stronger but that the obstacles the players are expected to deal with that are relevant to a skill challenge's success goes up by level. The skill challenge math in RC has you do 5 moderate and 1 hard. "Moderate" and "Hard" changes by PC level.<br/><br/>The much referred to, and much errata:ed, page 42, also states this.<br/>In 5e, DCs are easy: 10, moderate: 15, hard: 20. At every level.<br/>That's not how it is on page 42 of 4e DMG.<br/>Perhaps instead of a wooden door it's an acid porticullis with disco. Point is, 4e has DC treadmill.<br/><br/>So...<br/><br/>you seem to be saying that it's conflict resolution <i>but</i> we don't need to look at the mechanics on a conflict resolution level because the invididual skill rolls are interesting/consequential enough<br/><br/>whereas I'm saying it takes mechanics from task resolution but makes them less relevant/consequential, with unclearer stakes, than they would've been on their own (i.e. make them boringer <small>you're saying that they still have SOME mechanical consequence. And they do. But LESS. Opening one door in a dungeon with a skill roll means that roll has high stakes. Putting an entire skill challenge as "the lock" means that the rolls, to me, feel tedious</small>), and bake them into a conflict resolution system with wonky probability. Adding the DMG2 versions exacerbates it and doing DCs ad-hoc does that too.<br/><br/>And...<br/><br/>you seem to be saying that they have levels (so you can xp budget them) and they don't have levels (so you can still have wooden doors).<br/><br/>But they do have levels.<br/><br/>Since I prefer emergent situations over designed situations the xp budget thing isn't a selling point. 5e makes it easy to post-hoc reward xp for out-of-combat success.<br/>The party happened to become hostages to a camp of soldiers. And they negotiated their way out by healing the soldiers' sick. That wasn't a designed or budgeted situation or a planned solution. That's just what happened in the game. <br/><br/>I gave them 700 xp to share which is based on the slightly disconnected/disassociated rule that the xp in such situations is capped by the PCs level, regardless of the how dangerous the situation itself is. If they had subdued every soldier in the camp, bringing it under their control, I'd given them xp for all the soldiers. But since they merely made their way out of there, leaving the camp a still standing threat / resource, I used the ad-hoc xp rule. Not saying it's a good rule but just saying they get XP for not killing the monsters often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W" title="Trent_W"><img alt="Trent_W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Trent_W">Trent_W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475017/#Comment_475017" name="Item_135" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-06-25T02:27:27+00:00" title="June 25, 2018  2:27AM">June 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Sandra, at this point I think its best if we agree to disagree.

All that's supposed to happen is that some resources are drained. The fight doesn't actually have to feel "hard" in the usual sense. If the Fighter took 20 points of damage, and the Wizard spent a 2nd-level spell slot, then the encounter has served its purpose. Because 5E (and several other editions) rely on there being a strategy level, not just a tactics level. Managing resting and healing and all that is where much of the real challenge of the game lies.</p></div></blockquote>\nI've been thinking about this some more.<br/><br/>First of all, the 6\u20138 thing we can throw out. There is some truth to it but it's unhelpful advice for many.<br/><br/>Jeremy Crawford said that every encounter can start with full health and that's fine. (In the same breath he said that you could fudge monster stats so\u2026 <img alt=":disappointed:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/disappointed.png" title=":disappointed:"/> but that's doesn't affect my table, he is free to play his style.)<br/><br/>What I do think is a good guideline is, and this is on the same page as the 6\u20138 thing, is two short rests per long rest. (I.e. stuff \u2192 short rest \u2192 more stuff \u2192 short rest \u2192 even more stuff \u2192 finally long rest.)<br/><br/>It's annoying to be the warlock or the fighter (action surge) if the wizard can nova their steel wind strike and lightning bolt every single encounter. All of my fave classes (monk, warlock, fighter, rogue) are short rest classes.<br/><br/>So I don't have one rule for every campaign, I use different resting rules for every campaign (always looking for that perfect match) but that's one guideline, at least two short rests for every long. (Otoh, I guess the long rest classes don't want <i>more</i> than two, either. But they can handle themselves.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_475336">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/475336/#Comment_475336" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-07-13T11:22:36+00:00" title="July 13, 2018 11:22AM">July 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 13, 2018 11:34AM by 2097.">edited July 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" rel="nofollow">Deliverator</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>ETA: While we're at it...
