Perhaps kids don't need to worry about it because they resolve narrative conflict in their heads differently on some level. Is it that they are less self-aware of creating narrative conflict than adults?

Most adults are highly capable of maintaining multiple point-of-views in real life. "Evidence" to the opposite should be thoroughly tested for verification.<br/><br/>Practicing different POVs is very close to the hearth of social behavior; understanding your own position in different social environments, and showing empathy for the positions and emotions of others. <br/><br/>My experience with players suggest that an overwhelming majority of adults find role-playing games easy to understand and play.

People extend the fiction around them filling in backstories in movies and TV shows. People extrapolate or re-write their own stories and those of the people around them apparently effortlessly. <br/><br/>But if we compare the classic notion of a writer creating a conflict and then resolving it later, how can a person enjoy this under the crushing weight of the Czege Principle? Because if there is enough of a delay between the two then your perspective and context have changed enough that in a real way it is your past self making the conflict and your future self resolving it - not one person at all. <br/><br/>Edited because I was being to snarky...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403896/#Comment_403896" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T09:17:20+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  9:17AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sure, sure, sure, all reasonable points. But what I'm saying is, and the point of the original thread was, that there are actually inherent neurological differences between adults and kids on this *specific* kind of play. You or I or anyone else certainly <i>could</i> pick up a Han Solo action figure and a Boba Fett action figure in each hand and make them fight or whatever, but we are *fundamentally* incapable of enjoying such play in the way a little kid can.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403900">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy" title="Fuseboy"><img alt="Fuseboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/294/n454M25FRHU6K.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Fuseboy">Fuseboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403900/#Comment_403900" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T09:39:15+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  9:39AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tangentially related - For a few years, my wife facilitated a psychodrama group at a residential addiction program; one of the things she learned the hard way was that addicts seem to struggle with so-called 'intrapsychic' roles (e.g., your 'younger self', your 'wise adult', etc.) but can handle concrete roles (e.g. 'your mother', 'you'), etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403902">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403902/#Comment_403902" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T09:43:16+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  9:43AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is this in the same age range where children are engaging in parallel play? It sounds like it might be. And if so, then the conclusion the OP is making - that this means the children are capable of RPG play in a way that adults are not - is the exact opposite of what the research shows. Children under a certain developmental age are fundamentally incapable of protracted social play at all. They just can't really play with others.<br/><br/>But maybe I'm wrong and the phenomenon they are talking about goes on well past the transition out of parallel play and into social play ages.<br/><br/>(I find parallel play particularly fascinating as a gamer, because I look at a lot of what happens in multiplayer video games, especially MMOs, as being adults engaging in parallel play. Which, broadly speaking, I consider a bad thing. It's a case of repeatedly encouraging and reinforcing nonsocial behavior.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403928">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403928/#Comment_403928" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T14:15:15+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  2:15PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, I have introduced a lot of people to gaming:<br/>Ages<br/>8<br/>10<br/>12<br/>13<br/>16<br/>20<br/>22<br/>25<br/>26<br/>27<br/>28<br/>30<br/>31<br/>32<br/>and<br/>34<br/><br/>  I have had successes and failures in all age brackets.

But that is not the real barrier, typically, the barrier to fun gaming is fear of embarrassment. Adults that don't worry about that too much are more likely to succeed at gaming.<br/>Dave M<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403938/#Comment_403938" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-17T15:09:27+00:00" title="January 17, 2013  3:09PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I please have a link to any research or any thread discussing the original topic, so I can see that this thread isn't based on a strawman argument.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
