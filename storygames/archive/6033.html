It was partially inspired by pre-existing SF CoC attempts (like <i>Cthulhu Rising</i> and <i>End Times</i>), but with at least some of <i>Spaceship Zero</i> and <i>Delta Green</i> thrown in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's more setting than mechanics, so this may not be the best place for it to be posted.  Also, I wrote it in a text editor (yay, emacs!) so it's got actual end of lines instead of soft-wrapping.  Sorry about that.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>"The Stars, Our Right!"</b> (part 1)<br/>\n<br/>\nIntroduction<br/>\n<br/>\nCongratulations on being selected for the Pan-Earth Interstellar<br/>\nExploratory Force.  This document is intended to familiarize your with<br/>\nthe Force, it's mission, it's equipment, and your role within it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs you may know, the Pan-Earth Interstellar Exploratory Force is a<br/>\nmultinational joint service consisting of personnel and facilties<br/>\ndrawn from all member nations and colonies.  Organized in the wake of<br/>\nthe disastrous Formalhaut Incident, the Force is dedicated to the<br/>\nmutual sharing of information and research, whether or not this was<br/>\ngained prior to the establishment of the Force.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf the Formalhaut Incident has taught us anything, it is that<br/>\nmutual cooperation and the pooling of information will save lives in<br/>\nthe face of the unknown.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOrganization<br/>\n<br/>\nThe PEIEF organizes a number of different sorts of interstellar<br/>\nmissions.<br/>\n<br/>\nScout missions are generally made by small vessels with small crews.<br/>\nThey are the first sort of mission to visit a star system, and<br/>\nfrequently more than one will pass through a given star system before<br/>\nlarger missions will be dispatched.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe intention of scouting missions is to provide basic survey of the<br/>\nplanetary bodies and identification of features or anomolies which<br/>\nwarrant further investigation by more sizeable teams or experts.<br/>\n<br/>\nOccasionally, scouting missions will be placed into First Contact<br/>\nsituations.  More details will be provided later, in a dedicated<br/>\nbriefing.  To date, no First Contact with alien sentients has resulted<br/>\nin meaningful communication.  At best, we have encountered<br/>\nindifference, at worst, active hostility.<br/>\n<br/>\nSurvey missions are larger expeditions, and are intended to fully<br/>\nsurvey a single star system.  Typically consisting of multiple ships<br/>\nand potentially lasting for years at a time, survey missions will<br/>\nidentify local natural resources for potential exploitation, develop<br/>\npotential terraforming strategies, if warranted, and investigate any<br/>\nfeature of interest uncovered either during the initial scout mission<br/>\nor during the more meticulous dedicated survey.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf native flora and fauna are present, Survey missions will include<br/>\na xeno-biologist component tasked with studying the local biosphere.<br/>\nIf First or Second Contact is a possibility, specialists in those<br/>\nareas will also be included in the team.<br/>\n<br/>\nColony missions are very large, consisting of thousands of people and<br/>\nhundreds of ships, and in some cases may last a lifetime.  Tasked with<br/>\nsetting up and maintaining a wholly self-contained human settlement in<br/>\nan alien, possibly hostile, biosphere, complete with suitable<br/>\nagriculture and industrial base, a Colony mission is a truly herculean<br/>\nundertaking.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany colonies founded prior to the organization of the PEIEF will have<br/>\nidiosynchratic or otherwise non-standard organizational features, and<br/>\nmust be detailed on a case by case basis if contact and support of<br/>\nthem will be a component of your service.<br/>\n<br/>\nSupport missions are those organized for special purposes.  To support<br/>\nan existing Survey or Colony mission, either with additional technical<br/>\nexpertise, additional material supplies, or, under certain<br/>\ncircumstances, militarily.<br/>\n<br/>\nEvac operations fall under the aegis of Support missions.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough in some sense specialized Support missions, Forensic missions<br/>\nare organized and classified seperately.  Tasked with followup<br/>\ninvestigations of complicated or failed missions, Forensic mission<br/>\nteams will generally consist of a mix of both specialists and general<br/>\ntroubleshooting personnel, depending on specific circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nTechnology<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Transom Field Equations are the fundamental building blocks of<br/>\nmuch of the advanced technology used today in interstellar travel and<br/>\nexploration.  Everything from the Light-Wave Envelope to the Ansible<br/>\nare governed by the peculiar twists and bendings of space-time that<br/>\nTransom Theory describes and permits.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe heart of every starship is the York-Southwith Core, which<br/>\nsimultaneously provides power to the vessel, modulates local gravity<br/>\nand inertia, communicates with the Ansible network, propels the<br/>\nship through three-space via inertia and momentum polarization, and<br/>\npermits long-range macroscopic quantum tunneling, also known as "the<br/>\nJump".<br/>\n<br/>\nThis miracle of engineering has given us the stars.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLight-Wave Envelope<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Light-Wave Envelope is the mechanism by which the York-Southwith<br/>\nCore "jumps" a vessel from one place to another apparently faster than<br/>\nlight.  Such jumps are in fact an example of macroscopic quantum<br/>\ntunneling -- in effect, the entirety of the starship is surrounded by<br/>\na photon vector field which causes everything within the field to<br/>\nbehave as a single quantum system of macroscopic scope.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn most cases, such jumps are perceived to be instantaneous, although<br/>\noccasionally temporal distortion or jump stuttering -- where the<br/>\nvessel will serially tunnel to multiple unintended locations before<br/>\nit's waveform collapses at the final destination -- can prolong the<br/>\nsubjective duration.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome nausea and fatigue is a natural side effect of Light-Wave<br/>\nEnvelope jumps on biological systems.  It is this systemic stress<br/>\nwhich effectively limits jump range, and not technical considerations.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt should be noted that standard Force policy is for all psychics to<br/>\nbe sedated during "jumps", no matter what their Sensitivity rating.<br/>\nThis is for the health of both the psychic and the crew.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAnsible<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Ansible network consists of transmiters and receivers -- and<br/>\nsignal repeaters -- which together constitute an interstellar faster<br/>\nthan light data communications network.  Range is primarily determined<br/>\nby available transmission power, and like the Light-Wave Envelope<br/>\njump, is effectively instantaneous.<br/>\n<br/>\nOperating through specific modulations of space-time itself, the<br/>\nAnsible -- even more than the LWE -- is the lifeblood of the Human<br/>\ncolonies.  No matter where we go, we can still speak with one another.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass" title="unlikelylass"><img alt="unlikelylass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/danaellijohnson/SH5C2Orf01I/AAAAAAAAAFk/gbu1XwxZFyE/s144/dana-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass">unlikelylass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134991/#Comment_134991" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T19:22:19+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  7:22PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>"The Stars, Our Right!"</b> (part 2)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nGravity-Wave Envelope<br/>\n<br/>\nMuch like the Light-Wave Envelope, the Gravity-Wave Envelope surrounds<br/>\nthe ship with a vector field.  Unlike the macroscopic quantum effects<br/>\nof the Light-Wave Envelope, however, the GWE is used to produce<br/>\nso-called "artificial" gravity, inertial dampening, and reactionless<br/>\npropulsion.<br/>\n<br/>\nGravity-waves can also be used offensively -- to generate intense<br/>\nphysical stresses on targets -- or defensively -- to halt motion or<br/>\ndeflect trajectories of objects which may be intrinsically dangerous<br/>\nor in danger of impacting the starship.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nShort-Range Space-Warp, "Transitors"<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough Light-Wave Envelope jumps are quite effective for moving<br/>\nastronomical and interstellar distances, they require the YS Core<br/>\ngenerating the effect to move along with whatever is being jumped.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor shorter-range transportation of a similar sort, the YS Core can be<br/>\nemployed to generate a Short-Range Space-Warp.  Such space folding<br/>\ntemporarily maps two widely seperated regions of space-time onto each<br/>\nother.  Objects in one region of space-time can then transit to the<br/>\nother without any apparent motion.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch techniques do not require the YS Core to transit the space-warp,<br/>\nand in fact are produced in a manner entirely unlike the Light-Wave<br/>\nEnvelope.<br/>\n<br/>\nA functioning Gravity-Wave Envelope blocks the operation of such a<br/>\nTransit being attempted by a YS Core seperate from that producing<br/>\nthe GWE field.<br/>\n<br/>\nSuch 'Transitors' can be used to move on the order of 1,000 km.<br/>\n<br/>\nMany people -- psychics in particular -- find Transiting folded<br/>\nspace-time to be disorienting and uncomfortable.  Although such<br/>\nside-effects are common, there are no recorded long-term deliterious<br/>\neffects, and repeated usage, while uncomfortable, can be perfectly<br/>\nsafe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nYork-Southwith Core<br/>\n<br/>\nThe YS Core is the engineering marvel which drives the modern human<br/>\nstarship.  Approximately the size of a soccer ball, the YS Core in<br/>\nit's powered state appears to have twelve flat pentagonal sides,<br/>\ncorruscating with light and energy.  In it's inert state, it can be<br/>\nseen to be made of dull flat metal, etched with intricate geometric<br/>\npatterns crucial to the twisting of space-time it's internal<br/>\nmechanisms permit.<br/>\n<br/>\nField access to the internal components of the YS Core is recommended<br/>\nonly in emergency situations.  It is the policy of the Force that all<br/>\nsuch operations be conducted by at least two individuals, and<br/>\nappropriate protective eyewear be worn by all participants.  Under no<br/>\ncircumstances should YS Core field maintenance be conducted by<br/>\npsychics, no matter what their sensitivity rating.  It is advised,<br/>\nalthough not required, that psychics be sedated during any field<br/>\naccess to a vessel's YS Core.<br/>\n<br/>\nInternal alignment of the components of a YS Core is extremely<br/>\ndelicate and important.  Even microscopic misalignment of certain<br/>\ncomponents can result in erratic or otherwise dangerous operation.<br/>\nSome people find the geometric alignment of YS Core internals<br/>\ncan induce nausea and disorientation.  It is therefore Force policy<br/>\nthat all such access be undertaken with appropriate safeguards.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough a variety of starship systems rely on a functioning YS Core,<br/>\nthey are in fact external systems which each interface to the single<br/>\nYS Core the vessel is equipped with.  All PEIEF YS Cores are identical<br/>\nand may share parts or be interchanged with no alteration of<br/>\nperformance.  Size or configuration of vessel does not affect the YS<br/>\nCore, although it may affect the alignment, size, or nature of the<br/>\nauxillary systems.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nComputing Systems<br/>\n<br/>\nAll computation and data processing on a modern starship is<br/>\ntriply-redundant.  Hardware is optical in nature, and storage is<br/>\nholographic.<br/>\n<br/>\nNavigation systems, in particular, are multiply redundant and complex,<br/>\nand have dedicated computational engines used for nothing else.<br/>\nNavigation calculations are not, yet, an exact process, and jump<br/>\nstuttering and landing-zone drift are extremely common.  This is an<br/>\nunfortunate but unavoidable side effect of the computational tricks<br/>\nused to calculate an approximate Light-Wave Envelope field<br/>\ndistribution for a specific destination in a finite amount of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nMost starship navigators find that the mental stress of LWE jump field<br/>\ncalculation is extremely punishing.  It is therefore Force policy to<br/>\nrequire all Force crews to maintain redundancy in navigational<br/>\ncomputation tasks, and to cooperatively calculate all jump fields.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnder no circumstances should psychics undertake navigational<br/>\ncomputation.  It is Force policy to sedate all psychic crewmembers<br/>\nprior to navigational computation no matter what their Sensitivity<br/>\nrating.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome newer vessels have been equipped with experimental Sentient level<br/>\nexpert-system AI engines.  Such systems are always multiply redundant,<br/>\nand have no autonomous control ability of starship systems.  They are<br/>\nalways installed in addition to and in parallel with the existing ship<br/>\ncomputational systems.<br/>\n<br/>\nAI engines of this sort are as much dedicated specialized hardware as<br/>\nthey are anything else.  It is not Force policy to conduct field<br/>\nmaintenance on AI engines.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough theoretically capable of such operation, it is Force policy<br/>\nnot to run LWE jump field calculations on AI engines.  In laboratory<br/>\nconditions, such intellectual stress has had deleterious effects on AI<br/>\nengine cognition reliability.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is Force policy that psychics maintain a 10 meter exclusion radius<br/>\naround any operating AI engines present on their assigned vessels, no<br/>\nmatter what their Sensitivity rating.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSemi-Autonomous Drones<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a simple fact that much of the work of the Force is dangerous.<br/>\nIn order to protect our personnel, therefore, all missions are<br/>\nequipped with a multitude of Semi-Autonomous Drones.  Such drones can<br/>\nbe trusted to conduct many orbital surveys or other simple exploration<br/>\nor maintenance tasks unaided.  In addition all may be operated via<br/>\nAnsible-assisted tele-presence, allowing a mission member to provide<br/>\non-the-spot expertise without immediate danger.<br/>\n<br/>\nDrone machinery is far more simply replacable than people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass" title="unlikelylass"><img alt="unlikelylass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/danaellijohnson/SH5C2Orf01I/AAAAAAAAAFk/gbu1XwxZFyE/s144/dana-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass">unlikelylass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134992/#Comment_134992" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-14T19:22:50+00:00" title="March 14, 2008  7:22PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>"The Stars, Our Right!"</b> (part 3)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nMedical Technology<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is Force policy to include a medical officer on all missions, and<br/>\nfor this person to be a fully qualified Doctor if at all possible.<br/>\nAll Force vessels are equipped with extensive medical facilities up to<br/>\nand including full cryo-stasis berths for all crew-members.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll Force personnel undergo panimmunity treatments prior to mission<br/>\nassignment.  However, boosters or biosphere-specific adaptions may be<br/>\nrequired in the field, and the medical officer and facilities are<br/>\npresent for even these complicated tasks.<br/>\n<br/>\nCellular regeneration, while not recommended for field treatment, may<br/>\nbe necessary in emergency situations or during relief-style Support<br/>\nmissions.  Suitable equipment is always included on-board Force<br/>\nvessels.<br/>\n<br/>\nMemory transfer and full-body clone restoration are not permitted<br/>\nfield operations by Force regulations, despite the necessary equipment<br/>\nbeing present in order to facilitate other unrelated medical procedures.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the unusual duties falling to the medical officer on all Force<br/>\nmissions is the administering of sedatives to psychic crewmembers at<br/>\nappropriate times.  While each psychic crewmember will have a specific<br/>\ntailored regimen of sedatives detailed in his medical file, the<br/>\nmedical officer is authorized to supplement this under his or her own<br/>\nauthority.<br/>\n<br/>\nA related duty is the administering of psion-positive medications to<br/>\nmission psychics under certain circumstances.  Psychic interactive<br/>\npharmacology is a specific and technical portion of all medical<br/>\nofficer training prior to mission assignment.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough not prohibited from doing so, it is recommended that psychics<br/>\nnot serve as medical officers no matter what their Sensitivity rating.<br/>\nUnder no circumstances should a psychic medical officer be the only<br/>\npsychic assigned to a mission.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPsychics<br/>\n<br/>\nThe astute reader will have noticed a large number of standard Force<br/>\noperations psychics are excluded from undertaking.  You may wonder why<br/>\npsychics would be included in our missions at all if they are deemed<br/>\nso unreliable.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnreliability is not the issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, the Force has found psychics to have been repeatedly one of<br/>\nthe most crucial resources for mission success -- to the extent that<br/>\nit is standard Force policy to assign at least one psychic to every<br/>\nmission.  The restrictions placed on psychic behavior are intended not<br/>\nto protect the mission from psychic unreliability, but to maintain<br/>\nthe stability and utility of the psychic to the rest of the mission<br/>\npersonnel.<br/>\n<br/>\nRestricted duties are those which have been implicated in psychic<br/>\ninstability in the past, and by keeping our psychics away from them,<br/>\nwe hope to encourage our psychics to remain healthy and useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nAmong other things, psychics have been found to provide excellent<br/>\nearly-warning in cases of alien contact, all of which has, so far,<br/>\nbeen borderline hostile at best. Much of the insight we have into the<br/>\nactions of non-human sentients has come from first-hand perceptions of<br/>\ntheir gestalt psychic landscape -- sometimes colloquially referred to<br/>\nas a 'Dreamland' -- by human psychics.<br/>\n<br/>\nA significant number of recovered non-human artifacts have had psychic<br/>\ncomponents or required psychic sensitivities to make use of or to<br/>\nunderstand.  A mission without a psychic is as good as blind when<br/>\nfaced with this sort of situation.  What telemetry was recovered from<br/>\nthe Ameratsu's transmissions immediately preceding the Formalhaut<br/>\nIncident suggests that a psychic may well have averted that tragedy.<br/>\n<br/>\nPsychics are also a useful tool for assessing the mental health of the<br/>\nmission, providing another way of detecting issues with mission morale<br/>\nor with personnel who might be having stress or emotional trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is not to suggest that a ship's psychic is some sort of primitive<br/>\nThought-Police, or is regularly invading the privacy of his or her<br/>\ncrewmates.  Rather, it is a simple fact that psychics are aware of the<br/>\nemotional tenor of the people around them.  Anti-psychic intolerance,<br/>\nwhile understandably common in some member-state cultures, is not<br/>\ntolerated within the context of Force personnel relations, and will be<br/>\npenalized.<br/>\n<br/>\nFurthermore, it is not only non-human sentients who can be problems<br/>\nfor a mission.  In many cases, humans, be they  colonists, civilian<br/>\nstarship crews, claim-jumpers, non-Force-sanctioned exploration teams<br/>\n-- whether sponsored by Force member-states or otherwise --<br/>\nsmugglers, or other criminals, may need to be dealt with in the course<br/>\nof a mission.  Psychics are invaluable mission resources during any<br/>\nhuman social interaction.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nNon-human Sentients<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, it must be understood by all Force personnel that all<br/>\ninteractions with living Non-human Sentients should be approached as<br/>\nif they are engaging hostiles.  Do not shoot first, but be ready to<br/>\nshoot.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, it is the duty of all Force personnel to learn everything<br/>\npossible from any Non-human Sentient encountered -- living or<br/>\notherwise -- AND to survive long enough to communicate this<br/>\ninformation.  In person, if possible, but at the very least via<br/>\nAnsible.<br/>\n<br/>\nExpert xenothropologists are of the opinion that all Non-human<br/>\nSentient -- "alien" -- contact has so far been with beings whose<br/>\nthought processes and biology are so unlike ours that even making them<br/>\nunderstand that how Humans communicate as a species is communication<br/>\nmay not be possible.<br/>\n<br/>\nCertainly, the extensive -- and possibly multi-cultural -- abandoned<br/>\ncomplexes and ruins found on Pluto show no sign of having been sealed<br/>\nagainst vacuum.  How do you explain modulated sonic carrier waves --<br/>\nie, "talking" -- to something that doesn't even exist in a medium for<br/>\nsuch waves to move?  And how do you explain it without a common<br/>\ncommunication channel already established?<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is for this reason, if no other -- the sheer difficulty, if not<br/>\noutright impossibility of, establishing mutual communication with<br/>\nNon-human Sentients -- that First Contact opportunities are treated as<br/>\na priori hostile, and generally avoided by all Force personnel aside<br/>\nfrom experts and Support missions explicitly tasked with making<br/>\nContact.<br/>\n<br/>\nAside from this theorizing, the simple tally of failure, injury, and<br/>\ndeath in First Contact situations is telling.  Fully 63% of all Human<br/>\npersonnel who have experienced Contact with living Non-human Sentients<br/>\nhave died or are missing, and a futher 27% have been wounded in a<br/>\nnon-trivial fashion.<br/>\n<br/>\nExploration work is dangerous to begin with.  Aliens make it moreso.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell" title="John_Powell"><img alt="John_Powell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/nP846SDWNCDOK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Powell">John_Powell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135054/#Comment_135054" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T15:47:13+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  3:47PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the setting and the operations manual style of presentation.

My only worry is that, for me, the aliens might drain some of the tension out of play. That is... if aliens and psychic abilities are known, then what will they make of the Cthulhu Mythos stuff when they encounter it? They'll just be more aliens. Some quite large, and with amazing psychic powers, sure. But even Cthulhu himself? Nuke him from orbit. Just to be sure. <br>\n<br>\nI mean what's the difference between the known aliens, and the unknown ones? From the perspective of these scouts? The tension in DG and such is in the discovery that something like aliens actually do exist at all. It's that paradigm shift that turns the whole world upside-down. The tension is about the agents suspecting this from the evidence, and fighting that suspicion, looking for a "rational" explanation to the evidence, to maintain their own sanity. <br>\n<br>\nWill that still be here in your setting? Are you unconcerned? Is the thrust about something else? How is this not just "violent alien encounters," as opposed to the central mind-bending themes of CoC? <br>\n<br>\nMike                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tadk" title="tadk"><img alt="tadk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nAYGI7O6LI2LV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tadk">tadk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135216/#Comment_135216" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T11:19:29+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 11:19AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Amazing how suddenly similar ideas crop up fm other people.<br>\nLast week was thinking of an aliens/event horizon inspired RPG/Boardgame hybrid just for the heck of it.<br>\nThen you post this awesome idea. thanks again for posting it.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass" title="unlikelylass"><img alt="unlikelylass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/danaellijohnson/SH5C2Orf01I/AAAAAAAAAFk/gbu1XwxZFyE/s144/dana-tiny.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/unlikelylass">unlikelylass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135303/#Comment_135303" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T22:23:08+00:00" title="March 17, 2008 10:23PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tadk -- you are welcome, and please, copy it into whatever format you like and make whatever use of it you want.  I stuck it out here so that an idea I thought was keen would get used by somebody, even if I couldn't use it (immediately) myself.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike -- My idea there was that the aliens would all be actual Mythos creatures or races.  And they have all more or less ignored or been hostile, when encountered.  Their "technology" (which is to say, their magic) is "better"/"more advanced"/etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't intend that humanity as a whole would be aware of the mythos, but I would expect that everybody does see what they have encountered so far through the "lens" of contemporary SF thinking.  These are aliens we can trade with, and who will think like us, but have bumpy noses.  And for this to simply not be the case, at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nPsychic contact with mythos creatuers does drive psychics even more mad than other people.  The fundamental "horror" I've always felt at the center of Lovecraftian fiction is that human society and culture and moral and ethical considerations are completely at odds with the "reality" of Cthulhu and the Mythos as a whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nI basically want to transplant that disconnect to an SF setting.  We go merrily off into space, assuming our hypergeometric FTL drive is technology, misunderstanding it's fundamental principles.  We encounter nonhuman mythos creatues and think, "Oh, look!  Star Trek Aliens!"  And then we get whacked upside the head by the fact that being around them drives us nuts and their psychology is completely alien to us in ways we can't even comprehend.  Psychics go nuts that much faster -- if I use CoC rules for this, using psi powers will cost SAN to use.  And so will repairing the FTL drive or the AI engine for the engineers that end up doing that sort of thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nActivating the FTL drive will drain magic points off the crew -- that's the physical stress that limits how far a jump can be.  At least, that's my intention...<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat other people do with it, if they end up doing anything with it, is up to them, of course.  I definitely want to maintain the outright alienness of the mythos, and maintain it's deliterious effect on people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for nuking Cthulhu/Mythos beings from orbit -- great idea, except for the fact that they're all hyperdimensional and made of exotic matter.  Concussive force and radiation don't really affect them the way it does, say, mammals...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135375/#Comment_135375" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T10:02:01+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 10:02AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 18, 2008 10:05AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that I'm starting to get it. Or it might just be that I'm not seeing a way to make this work for myself. The reference above to Event Horizon got me thinking. That movie is an imitation of Solaris (the book is far superior to the movie version - not something I always claim). And what seems to be true of CoC and such stuff, to me, is that it's different from the movie Alien. Alien is a simple monster movie - perhaps the best of all time, and a favorite of mine - but just a monster movie. CoC and Solaris, etc, are much more introspective. That is, what's particularly horrific is what it reveals about ourselves, moreso than what it reveals about the aliens. We don't understand them. Fine. The universe has always seemed absurd on its own. That's non-problematic. But it's what contact with them shows us about ourselves that's horrific. <br>\n<br>\nFor CoC, what's discovered is that we are not who we think we are. That is, we think we have this rational existence, and that what you see is what you get. But if it turns out that this is not true, that's where things get disturbing. The scary thing about the mythos is not that there's some monsters far off in space... it's that there are monsters in and amongst us every day. <br>\n<br>\nSo... if play of this game is a discovery of that fact, if it leads back to Earth... or if it makes us somehow stare ourselves straight in the eye, only to discover that we're no more rational, really, than the mythos... then I think it'll work. CoC can be timeless, I'm sure. But only by focusing on the horror of our nature, and not just approaching it as monster movies. I can see doing it with what you have. <br>\n<br>\nA particular problem, however, is the Clarke Principle... "Any sufficiently advanced technology appears as magic." Indeed, is there any difference, functionally, between magic and high-tech. I really like the idea that the technology of the humans is actually "magic." But how do you prove that to them? How do you reveal the horror, when the scientists can just fall back on Clarke? "Don't be superstitious, it's just too advanced for us to understand yet... Someday we'll figure out that sub-atomic phasing thing that they do, and then the nukes WILL work!"<br>\n<br>\nThis is especially problematic in the context of the mythos... you can't say that it's about their particular morality, because, as you point out, they don't have one that's recognizable. So, yeah, you have to actually make the magic point to it's masters, and point out the absurdity of it's meaning. Like, if a character uses a psychic ability, then (not only does he push his sanity, but) he causes unintended consequences. Classic CoC stuff like summoning Nyarlathotep, or it just causing random crewmembers to turn up inside out, or whathaveyou. And a slow realization by the psychic using the ability that the ability doesn't exist primarily to move people from point A to point B, but to turn them inside out...<br>\n<br>\nHmmmm...

My posts are probably more about my own ability to find it useful, or how to. <br>\n<br>\nIf I might try a different tac, I'm assuming that, even if some large percentage of people who have encountered the mythos have died, that those who have survived have brought back recordings with them? Basically... the characters know what a Byakhee looks like, yes? And expecting it to be alien in appearance, since they'll assume it has evolved in another world, under alien pressures, they won't really be shocked by it's appearance. Right? <br>\n<br>\nThey're not going to have to make SAN checks (or whatever mechanics), when viewing these creatures for the first time. Is that correct? Since they'll have seen ones before, or, at least, be expecting to see things as different as the Byakhee they have a recording of?<br>\n<br>\nBasically, as "aliens," they're no longer unexpected, no longer something that we don't think can exist. The shock to our sanities is not due specifically to their shapes, per se. It's that the forms that they take are such that, if found on Earth, they would suddenly cause our brains to have to consider that the world is very much other than we think it is. Our parents lied. Monsters do exist. And they are even worse than we imagined. <br>\n<br>\nIf we're bulwarked against this, if the movie is Alien 3, and we've got specimens in storage, then their forms are no longer the source of our disquiet. Oh, perhaps a bit... like you might feel if you had to handle a cuttlefish... but not in that mind-bending, "The world is not what I thought it was" sort of fashion that sudden exposure to something that you thought could not exist, would. <br>\n<br>\nAnd, again, that's just the monsterous first glance. What about the fact of their existence amongst us, and what that implies? The fact that we are actually a product of their experiments, and/or an accident of their history. <br>\n<br>\nI think we're talking about the same things here, really. I'm just prefering to keep it all a bit closer to the vest. Or basically make it the same old CoC world, just one that's gotten into space before it's become widely known (if at all), that the creatures of the mythos exist.<br>\n<br>\nI mean... is there any problem with playing out the ill-fated Formalhault expedition? Or the first first-contact? Those are going to be the most horrific, I think. For me, at least. <br>\n<br>\nIn fact, in CoC games in which I've been involved, there's another principle, too. Which is the DG "Plausible Deniability Protocol." Meaning that the good guys who find this stuff out do not try to tell the world. Oh, they might start to at first (and be ignored as crackpots). But then the really evil truth dawns on them... they can't tell the world. Because if they do, then mass insanity will grip the planet, as it causes Cthulhu to rise again. Oh, sure, he will eventually anyway. But let humanity rest easy, leaving us something to save, while we try to puzzle out if there's anything we can do to stop the eventual end of the world. <br>\n<br>\nThe point being that I don't want credible reports coming back on the true nature of things. Perhaps the background above, and the beliefs in question, are created by a conspiracy of those who know the horriffic truth (or guess at it), and are just trying to prevent the madness from reaching home.

We know there are hostile aliens, and we maybe have a few hints about what they look like, but we don't have samples, we don't have good photographs/video/whatever, and the witnesses we have are half-mad and unreliable.<br/>\n<br/>\nSwitching horses a little, I would expect most space travel to require UA-style "Unnatural Checks" when encountering aliens, "Isolation checks" for being off in deep space alone or in a small group, and Unnatural and/or Self checks for, say, telepathic contact with even other humans.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne of the reasons that the stuff I wrote didn't include aliens is that when I got to aliens, I realized pretty quickly that I needed to think carefully and handle them "right", and that I while I understood in my head the approach I wanted, I didn't know how to frame it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote a bit about the "known aliens", actually, but specifically excluded it from the initial posts because I wasn't sure about how I'd written it up.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere's what I had -- these are Shan, Serpent People, flying Polyps, and Mi-Go, respectively:<br/>\n<br/>\n-- snip --<br/>\n<br/>\nKnown Alien Sentients<br/>\n<br/>\nThis list is not exhaustive, but includes those beings we have<br/>\nencountered most often, most widely spread, who appear to be<br/>\ntechnologically advanced.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther Non-human Sentients have been encountered, but appear to be<br/>\nplanet-bound or non-technological in one way or another, and are not<br/>\ncatalogued here.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPyramid Builders<br/>\n<br/>\nA variety of large-scale -- hundreds of meters on a side --<br/>\nspace-bourne pyramidal structures are the hallmark of this species or<br/>\ncivilization.  The vessels appear and disappear in what seem to be FTL<br/>\njumps, but the mechanism does not register as a Light-Wave<br/>\nEnvelope-style jump, and is in fact utterly undetectable to our<br/>\ninstruments.  Something that wasn't there now is, or vice versa.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe only known contact with beings from the inside of such a vessel<br/>\nresulted in a complete failure of mission and loss of all personnel.<br/>\nAnsible telemetry was jumbled and otherwise corrupted for<br/>\napproximately 30 minutes between our vessel's first announcement of<br/>\ndetection to loss of signal and presumed destruction.<br/>\n<br/>\nForensic mission analysis produced no additional data.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLizards<br/>\n<br/>\nOn four widely seperated terrestrial worlds we have found very small<br/>\n-- on the order of hundreds of inhabitants -- settlements of these<br/>\nreptillian humanoids.  On two occasions the discovery resulted in<br/>\nactive hostilities.  In all four cases mission failure resulted, and<br/>\nin two all personnel were lost and presumed dead, in one all personnel<br/>\nlived due to immediate flight, and in the remaining mission two-thirds<br/>\nof the mission personnel were killed either directly by one or more of<br/>\nthe Lizards, or due to subsequent damage to the Force vessel after<br/>\nhaving taken fire from some unknown directed energy weapon.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all cases, subsequent Forensic missions have failed to locate the<br/>\nsettlements, although a small amount of environmental evidence has<br/>\nbeen obtained at each site.<br/>\n<br/>\nRumors that the mission psychic murdered his crew mates are unfounded<br/>\nand incorrect.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nPolyp Ghosts<br/>\n<br/>\nOn two widely seperate planets, with biospheres wholly unlike one<br/>\nanother, are large basalt-like stone metropolises.  Each of these<br/>\ncities is populated by thousands of apparently biological creatures<br/>\nwho appear to be at least partially extradimensional -- what the<br/>\nmathematicians are refering to as a metabolic hyperextension.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe beings in question appear to be only semi-corporeal, their forms<br/>\nshifting and in some cases appearing to pass through one another and<br/>\nsolid objects.  They also seem to have no difficulty in travelling<br/>\nthrough the air or space, and attempts to injure or interact with them<br/>\nduring our encounters with them have been utterly unsuccessful.<br/>\n<br/>\nA total of three contact attempts have resulted in multiple casualties<br/>\nand injuries in each case.<br/>\n<br/>\nForensic missions have not been attempted due to the actively hostile<br/>\nnature of these beings.  It is Force policy to avoid them when<br/>\nencountered.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWinged Lobsters/Brain Snatchers<br/>\n<br/>\nSeven widely spaced encounters between Human vessels and these beings<br/>\nhave resulted in mixed responses, ranging from utter indifference to<br/>\nactive hostility.  Forensic missions have found Human corpses in<br/>\nvarious states of surgical dissection.  Human nervous tissue is often<br/>\nmissing from such finds, although a wide variety of organs and tissue<br/>\nhave been found removed for purposes unknown.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur best guess is that the Lobsters are trying to learn about us.<br/>\nSome of our xenothropologists are encouraged by this idea, as such<br/>\ncuriosity appears to be a point of commonality between these alien<br/>\nbeings and ourselves.  The fatal approach these beings are taking has<br/>\ndiscouraged others, and underscores just how dangerous it is to<br/>\nattribute Human thought and behavior patterns to alien beings.<br/>\n<br/>\n-- snip --<br/>\n<br/>\nThe basic idea, though, is much like DG.  Nobody knows exactly what is going on, but what some people think is going on -- ie, "Star Trek/standard SF style alien beings" -- really really isn't.  No firm evidence of anything conclusive, and lots of contradictory and unhelpful contact in widely spaced, out of the way, corners of "the world" .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_136013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136013/#Comment_136013" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-23T00:24:19+00:00" title="March 23, 2008 12:24AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it might actually be more horrible for the insanity to be, you know, catalogued and documented.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Over 48 hours of contact with Alien Sentient X37 consistently causes permanent brain damage via the Wheeler effect."<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's like counting your rads, but for the brain.<br/>\n<br/>\nyrs--<br/>\n--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_136017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/136017/#Comment_136017" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-23T02:44:49+00:00" title="March 23, 2008  2:44AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those alien descriptions are pretty darn good.
