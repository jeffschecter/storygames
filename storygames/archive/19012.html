Actually, this isn't *just* an OSR thread, it is probably more broadly applicable.<br/><br/>So, I've been playing DW with a sandbox-y, adventure-first theme.<br/>It's great fun, anyhow, but I feel like I'm always pulling my punches.<br/><br/>Specifically, they have a great tendency to blunder into things, never asking questions, thinking things through, or planning. If I were totally honest to the world and my prep, they probably would've died (or suffered fates worse than death) a few times over by now. However, it seems a little... unfair to hit them that hard, even if it is honest, because, well, they aren't even trying.<br/><br/>Is there a good way to encourage the players to take a minute, think things through, ask questions (or even just spout lore more, even)?<br/>I want to present real, dangerous, life-or-death situations, but if they're just gonna jump down every pit that's actually a gaping hellvoid, well, it'll be a very short game.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>- Alex                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ffilz" title="ffilz"><img alt="ffilz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/808/nVMJ55Y63CBO5.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ffilz">ffilz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424568/#Comment_424568" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T12:58:35+00:00" title="November 21, 2013 12:58PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Even in the old days, I would ask "are you sure you want to do that?"

It perhaps didn't go as planned.<br/><br/>However, I think a fair up-front warning plus a few in-game examples will be clear, and they're smart and mature enough to handle this anyhow.<br/>But, I still want to help them along. To provide an example, in any other game I would know a clear way to say, oh, "Here is a better strategy / move / way of doing X." but for some reason, I don't know a clear way to explain / show this in RPGs. I certainly don't want to, for example, tell a player what to do right there in the game, but I'm not sure if there's a decent way to provide examples or something like that.<br/><br/>I do do the "Are you sure?" thing though.<br/><br/>- Alex                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424573/#Comment_424573" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T13:23:21+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  1:23PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's also a broad spectrum between "insta-kill" and "mess you up bad" situations.

Provoke thought about what you wish they'd have on their mind by asking them about it, but wrapped up in something they've already done or are doing, so you're not second-guessing and slowing them down. Ex:<br/><br/>"So you hit hit him? Cool, how do you swing? Oooh, that'd hurt, yeah, you're handy with that bat. You ever used it before? No? <b>You ever had to explain something like this to the cops?</b> Yeah, well, you're brutal for a writer, you know that? The bat CRACKS against his skull, but his skull--just sort of caves in like paper mache..."<br/><br/>Emphasis posthumous. It was the player's first time with Don't Rest Your Head, and it didn't seem like it'd be much fun if he was unprepared for the boys in blue to have Very Big Questions about the two corpses on his doorstep. He was playing fast and reckless, which is great for DRYH, but to that point I hadn't wanted to put in any really big, visible, tangible consequences until he seemed to have some inertia... but now he'd killed some[one|thing], and it was definitely time.<br/><br/>On the one hand, I couldn't just ignore that there were two corpses on his doorstep, both blunt force traumatized, one of them in a uniform, him wild-eyed with a bloodied baseball bat. On the other hand, I didn't want to audibly second-guess him just jumping into the violent, reckless response to the creepy jerk and possibly become perceived as an obstacle to future lunacy. That'd just feel like a roadblock. So I tossed that question in, and wrapped it all up in the act of violence to foreshadow the consequences. I'm not sure if it worked for him in particular, but the other two players uttered "...oh my" and "God dammit" respectively.<br/><br/>Subsequently, they stayed reckless, but they knew it was recklessness, and knew there were consequences. I started getting questions like "Wait, really? He's just gonna take that?" "He glares at you from under the flab of his brow like he hasn't got time for your shit. He ain't takin' anything, it's slidin' off like butter on teflon." "'Hey, swine, did I stutter?!' I grab his lapel!"<br/><br/>So I'd suggest similar, like "Locked? Feh, I kick down the door!" "How many doors you kicked down, Rogar? Like a hundred or more, right?" ... "Hey, Rogar, this door wasn't trapped, but hey, does this stonework remind you of anything? Remember that door that was trapped? Why do you remember, didn't it kill someone?"<br/><br/>I'm not sure if this would slot into your group/narration/etc, but the easiest way to get them thinking in my experience is to provoke it all-but-explicitly, just enough that whatever comes of it is still their idea. If it gets them thinking, validate their thinking, and they ought to keep thinking. If it doesn't, well, hopefully you felt charitable during your prep.<br/><br/>Side note: if they're used to dungeon crawling in something d20-based (Edit: by which I really mean '3.0 based'), they're probably used to anything pertaining to traps and ambient danger having rolls come before it to herald it. DW lacks ominous dice rolls behind screens, so it could be they're leaning on old habits and holding out for their Perception Check or Reflex Save.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson" title="d.anderson"><img alt="d.anderson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/d.anderson">d.anderson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424576/#Comment_424576" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T13:44:47+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  1:44PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seconding the suggestion to use soft moves for the learning curve, and mention what you see as the obvious consequences for the "are you sure" question.<br/><br/>I've run a bunch of DW now and been able to play more than a couple times and we have loads of fun, letting characters try crazy things.

I mean, it's pretty obvious that if they <i>really</i> understood the dilemma you propose here, they would surely be more careful, tactical and in general more conscious of the established fiction and less happy-go-lucky.<br/><br/>(The following is on the assumption that you'd want your game to be <i>challenge-based</i> in creative agenda: players actually, really trying to maneuver in the fiction to accomplish something. Your initial post is ambivalent enough that maybe this is actually not what you want - I'd be interested in hearing clarification, maybe you just want the players to author a different type of fiction with you, or whatever. So read the below with that in mind, it might not apply to you at all.)<br/><br/>On that vein: have you discussed your wished for emphasis of the campaign with the players? Have you told them that they're forcing you to pull punches by not taking things seriously? I say that it's them doing it to you simply because of your instincts: of course you could just kill them until they start paying attention, but as your instincts correctly tell you, it's not a real challenge and a satisfying death if the player wasn't even trying in the first place. I wouldn't characterize it as "unfair" (except if you really have not talked about the assumptions in advance), though; if you tell the players that it's going to be skill-based campaign and then they fail, it should come as no great surprise that they'll die.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, I don't believe in the approaches I listed in the above paragraph myself, I'm just being politically correct. The real truth of the matter is that you can talk until you're blue in the face, but people who don't have a great deal of analytical talent or practical experience of different games are almost unable to understand differing playstyles on a gut level. For this reason my own strategy in introducing people to this style of play is simple: I tell them how it's gonna be, and then I kill their characters until they grok it.<br/><br/>The above might seem harsh, and of course it's not glorious from your viewpoint to shoot fish in the barrel, but I genuinely believe that it is the only way to teach new styles of play: they have to try things and fail, and learn what works. Nothing teaches a player better than first hearing that it's gonna be a harsh skill-based game where your character's life is at stake, and then actually having that threat carried through. The player will be dismayed, but then they will know first-hand the real stakes: "your character dies" is just words, the real stakes are of esteem, satisfaction and commitment to your character. It's a harsh buzz to have a character you liked die to scrupulously fair GMing; the sort of player for whom a challenge-based adventure game is right will saddle up after the shock passes and start <i>really</i> playing, now that they know that it wasn't just the ordinary sort of smoke-up-your-ass that the GM was blowing.<br/><br/>In a nutshell: if you want the old school D&amp;D attention to fictional detail, you have to have the old school D&amp;D reward system that pushes for that attention. And that means really, genuinely killing characters because the player did not declare where that character was standing. <i>That's</i> how you get players to pay attention in this paradigm, and once they pay attention and step on up to face the challenge of survival, <i>that's</i> when you've arrived. Of course there are other ways to find commitment, but you did ask about the OSR way, if I understood correctly.<br/><br/>Of course, I have a few caveats:<br/><br/>This style of play does not work for some people psychologically. For example, my brother Markku is a pussy-cat (I mean this with all love) who just wants to have fun telling stories in a roleplaying game. He even has difficulties playing ordinary boardgames; apparently something to do with hating confrontations and fearing failure, who knows. If you have a player like this, the choice is absolutely strict: either you play without them, or you don't play a hardcore challenge-based game (which is what I consider a fantasy adventure game played for death stakes to be).<br/><br/>Second, your choice of game might or might not be correct for this style of play. I personally think that playing Dungeon World from a challenge-based perspective, especially hardcore (which we must be talking about when the GM discusses how he doesn't want to "pull punches" and how the characters "should have died" - that's harsh edge, man!), is taking the game outside its design parameters. There are many subtle things I might comment upon, except that I haven't even played the game myself, so it is not really my place. Still, consider: do you really want to have death stakes at the table in a game where character generation involves picking powers off a random access list? I wouldn't, but then I want chargen to be quick as lightning to assuage the harshness of dying in the first encounter.<br/><br/>Third, your own attitude betrays you: if I were you, I would very carefully consider whether I am in fact pulling punches, or if I just think so myself. I suggest this possibility simply because I perceive an undertone in your writing that is not compatible with the type of social dynamic you want, not unless you lie to the players. To be specific: you never once say in the OP that death is <i>actually</i> on the table, you just say that you'd like the players to act like it was. That's just not possible unless you're actually willing to play for those stakes, and I don't see how it is pulling punches if you never had any wish or intention to go through with it anyway. If you have stupid players or superficial play, you can lie to them and make them think that surely you'll be killing their characters if they mess up; D&amp;D has a glorious, glorious history along those lines. If this is what you actually want, I still recommend choosing a scapegoat and killing them to begin with: it's harsh medicine, but once you've gotten the symbolic killing out of the way (you could even secretly arrange it with the player in question, to make your deceitful ways complete), I think you'll find that your credibility as a "killer GM" has gone up quite a few notches. It'll be a long time before the players will again question your killing instinct, and meanwhile you'll have the sort of play you desire, with the players fearing for their characters.<br/><br/>Fourth, assuming again that you genuinely want a challenge-based paradigm: I suggest that you confess immediately to the players that you have been pulling punches, and warn them that you'll stop doing that from now on. This is because trust is paramount in the relationship modeled after old school D&amp;D; the players need to be able to trust that you'll play fairly, and that means both the good and the bad. The very act of not playing it as it lays is a broken promise from this viewpoint. For correction, I recommend scrupulous refereeing hygiene and avoidance of arbitrary value-laden choices; develop and obtain procedures of play that help you in making decisions in a fair and objective manner instead of "pulling punches" or "going for the kill" (the opposite attitude). Of course this comes back to the second point: DW is simply more difficult to run in an objective refereeing model than old school D&amp;D due to certain features of procedure and rules.<br/><br/>As you can see, ultimately it boils down to one question: what is the creative agenda of the campaign? If it's really challenge-based and you'd really want character death to be at stake, then start killing them and they'll start to smarten up. If you just want players to create more realistic-seeming fiction, then talk to them about it, explain that you'd have more fun if they role-played more and acted like their characters are fearful of death.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424579/#Comment_424579" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T14:33:12+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  2:33PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'll clarify my fourth caveat now that I read the rest of the thread, too: I really think that that's your biggest hurdle here.<br/><br/>You see, there is a secret to the social dynamic of old school D&amp;D, a secret that allows it to play with the high stakes it plays. That secret is this: the GM is supported and elevated by a mythology of impartial refereeing. This elevation insulates the GM from the difficult, cruel choices he has to make, it protects him from becoming the target of player resentment. By breaking this wall of factual impartiality (even if you have not told the players about it; they can likely sense it in the nuances of your creative interaction) you run the danger of becoming <i>responsible</i> for what happens in the game. That's the secret, by the way: nobody is responsible for what happens in a D&amp;D adventure, it all happens in automatic writing, and you can't therefore blame the GM when your favourite character dies horribly.<br/><br/>Imagine - or let's say I will: the way I imagine it, the first time you actually have some character die, the players will all put massive scrutiny on your actions. That's the crucible that either breaks or makes the challenge-based game. As the players scrutinize the event, they will develop one of two narratives about what happened: they choose either the Watsonian or the Doylean narrative, I might say, as they will have to decide whether <i>you decided</i> that the character should die, or whether it was the <i>orc who dunnit</i>. The players will base their choice on which way to jump here on many things: indoctrination (how the game has been explained to them in advance), transparency in GMing (whether they understand the choices you make and the principles they're made with), the game system (which provides for objective or subjective means of resolving various situations), social chemistry (if you dislike the player whose character is first on the chopping block, that'll make it harder for the players to believe that you truly did not cause it by choice) and of course the actual legitimacy of the refereeing decisions that possibly went into that character death (if those are actually wrong and unjust, nothing will save you, except perhaps the players being ignorant sheeples who don't know to call you on the bullshit).<br/><br/>The thing is, if the players choose the Doylean paradigm for interpreting the events of play, the game is ruined, you can't play this style of game anymore without working hard to rebuild confidence in the fiction. We know exactly what Doylean D&amp;D looks like: it's like hardcore 3rd edition D&amp;D, where players expect and demand balanced encounters, appropriate wealth by level, access to magic items appropriate to their class, access to arbitrary prestige classes, and so on. The reason for this attitude is simply in that the game does not have the mythology of impartial, objectively existing fictional milieu protecting it; when wolves attack in a random encounter, the players do not think that they had bad luck, but rather that the GM chose to put wolves there to attack them. When a character falls in a pit, it was the GM who put the pit there. When your character doesn't have enough treasure or the prestige class they want "does not exist in the setting", it was the GM who decided that, and he's an asshole for playing against the spirit of the game and pissing on you just for the sake of his precious whatever-it-is-that-makes-him-piss-on-me.<br/><br/>I want to emphasize that just like with Sherlock Holmes fiction, neither the Doylean nor the Watsonian explanation of the fiction is more correct than the other. However, the social responsibility of the GM becomes unbearable in an old school game where the players do not have a primarily Watsonian perspective: they have to be willing to suspend disbelief (or even genuinely be correct in thinking that you're impartial and the setting is consistently logical) and blame their own choices or bad luck or cruelty of the orcish tribes when their characters die. If they, instead, resent you for it, you can see how difficult it would be for play to continue.<br/><br/>For this reason I think that your biggest problem is that you're already pulling punches: you've <i>already</i> broken the covenant, so strictly speaking the players are now justified in expecting that you'll protect their characters and let them continue playing Candyland. If you change tacks now, it needs to be done carefully and very openly, so that nobody needs to feel resentment because they trusted in you to not pull off a harsh move, and then they step on a landmine.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_424580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik" title="Christopher Kubasik"><img alt="Christopher Kubasik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christopher%20Kubasik">Christopher Kubasik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424580/#Comment_424580" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-21T14:40:40+00:00" title="November 21, 2013  2:40PM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy Cow.

It's also fun to see the players adjusting to the playstyle and learning the necessary skills.

It definitely added an excitement that was very new to me in my experience of gaming. There was a sequence where another character and mine both took an Invisibility Potion and scouted a cave of bugbears \u2013 by far the biggest, nastiest character we\u2019d encountered at that point \u2013 and I remember feeling my palms sweat and heart race as we tried to get as much information as possible without alerting anything to our presence.</blockquote>\nThere is also an art to describing something they glance at without too much detail, asking what they do and how they do it and then unveiling more details as they really start to examine.<br/><br/>I remember a dungeon in Torchbearer and they were in an owlbear's nest in a dark cave and they missed the owlbear eggs, a treasure worth a pretty penny to the right wizard. I almost jumped up and down in glee when Bret said, "No, hold up. I search the owlbear nest more carefully. What's in there under the owlbear feather-fur and bones?" Detachment isn't my strong suit as a DM and dungeon crawls aren't my strong suit at all but I'm-a-learnin'.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424609/#Comment_424609" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-22T07:21:06+00:00" title="November 22, 2013  7:21AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            100% agreement with Eero.
