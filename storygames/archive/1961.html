                    So this is one of the topics that I'm interested in from the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1960" rel="nofollow">What donâ€™t you understand about gaming</a> thread.<br/><br/>Now, I donâ€™t have kids yet, but when I do, I have plans.  As a former teacher, for instance, I will be reading to my kids a lot (tangent: tons of research underscores the profound impact that â€œbedtime storiesâ€ have in childrenâ€™s literacy, which in turn develops thinking skills, memory, school performance, empathy, and so on â€“ so read to your kids religiously).  I also want to play games with them.  Board games, card games, roleplaying games.  Games teach a boatload of skills, from math to reading to imagination to social interaction.  As a GURPS player all through school, most of my history classes were only reviewing content that Iâ€™d already read about in a sourcebook.<br/><br/>In addition to all of those â€œhard skillsâ€ above, though, Iâ€™m also interested in games as a way to teach critical thinking in ethics and to teach compassion.  This is why Princeâ€™s Kingdom is on the top of my list, here.  I want games that give my kids practice making tough decisions, so when it comes time to make the real tough decisions, theyâ€™ve got some experience to back them up.<br/><br/>So in this thread, Iâ€™d like to see two things: (a) what kinds of things do you want to see in RPGs for kids, and (b) maybe a little design-talk about how to provide this stuff.                </div>

                            I've been thinking about this too, since I unsuccessfully tried to introduce my kids to roleplaying using D&amp;D 3.5 (before my mind was blown open at the Forge).  Here's what I most want from children's roleplaying games:<br/><br/>They should allow the kid to use and hone their creativity, respect and promote their input, and allow them to learn in the process.<br/><br/>I think there are two parts in this to consider:  How to keep a kid's interest, and how to promote the creativity and learning.<br/><br/>I've already thought about making a Beast Hunters Junior version, and probably will at least for us at home, with simplified rules, but keeping the focus on negotiation and on allowing the player to come up with their own solutions.  I would also lower the emphasis on fighting and go more in the direction of Princes' Kingdom, with the way situations are set up for the kids to address.  But keeping something to hunt and collect (maybe, like Pokemon, in a non-lethal manner) appears to me to be a good motivator for continued play.                        </div>

                            I'd love to go in with someone on designing a game that is marketable to grade-schools!   (justifyable as theater!)  -i used to work as a pre-school teacher and this just reminds me of a hilarious scenerio that I had only done to keep the kids entertained adn get them some exercise and 'pretending' time-<br/><br/>It depends on the age, compeltely, but the idea that worked best in my past, was having the kids split up into two groups.  This particular group was four year olds, so the theme was simple.   One side were the "Sara's" and the other side were the "Kim's!"  They were told that one side of the gym was a forest (The sara's) and the other side of the gym was the City (The Kim's) and between the two, (in a warded off section of one foot to either side and all the way across the line in the middle of the gyme floor) was the River.   (we had two classes with us, so it was 38 kids, 3-6  - we did classes by teams so that the kids could remember who was who...) We took fifteen of the older kids and told them they were river people...and they could be anyone they wanted from a story.  (and yes, we had alot of superheros...which almost made me want to change the theme, but that would have just confused them at this point)<br/><br/>With gaming, especially with children, you have to start things off simple...and set the groundwork first, before you get started on characters.<br/><br/>So, we established teams and territory, and then the teachers told them all the rules of the game.  (me and Kim)<br/><br/>The river people were told that they had to collected berries (little balls that were all around the forest side of the gym) from the forest, and collect medicine from the city, (little boxes that we had set about the 'city side')   BUT..they had to be careful, because if the city or forest people caught them, they might be captured!<br/><br/>The city people were told that there forest people who were trying to steal their medicine, and the forest people were told that the people from the city were trying to steal all of their berries...   They could take ANYONE prisoner by tagging them, and saying "STOP!"  But, they were only frozen...and could not be brought to jail unless a second person stopped and also said "Stop!"   then they all held hands and the 'prisoner' was brought to jail....<br/><br/>but...the prisoner could try and convince them that they were mistaken...and had the wrong person...Or they could convince the jailers (there was always someone to be jailer, usually two!, we just asked who wanted to be.)   to let them out of jail...And, yes, you could also try and convince someone that someone ELSE was the 'wrong side' and get them captured.<br/><br/>Then we had all of the kids pick somewhere to stand, and started the game.<br/><br/>...it was the most hilarious thing I had ever seen.  (my focus went to a few things in particular)<br/><br/>We had one little girl who would literally walk up, start taking the berries and someone would capture her, but she'd tell them that she was 'guarding' them...and they'd just let her wander off...with the berries.<br/><br/>Eventually, a few other children caught on and she was jailed, but she convinced the jailer that she wouldn't steal anymore berries and that she'd pretend to be a city person so that THEY could get medicine.  (keep in mind that the forest people weren't told they needed this..)   The jailer thought this was a great idea...and so let her go.   She stole medicine all right...and brought it to the river, along with the other collection that she made.    She convinced the city side that she was keeping it safe...and it took a while for someone to call her on it and jail her again....  (I was dying at this point, because this little girl was sly!)<br/><br/>At this point, my attention turns to the jailer, who bribes a 'sara' aka, a forest girl, with letting her out, as long as she steals some medicine back, because his puppy is sick and needs the medicine.    The girl, who awws and tells him that she'll help him...and walks over, and tells this story to a river boy who isn't that convinced, but then is chided by a river girl that "Hey, we have lots of medicine now, we have to help the puppy!"   and so thus, a medicine is forked over...willingly!  (we never said the medicine and berries couldn't be put back, just that no one could steal them from the river...)<br/><br/>...there's alot more crazy and hilarious context that came out of this...but...this thread got me thinking...  *grins*<br/><br/>At the end of the game, we all talked about what happened, and they were talking about their stories for the rest of the week.   We never did get to play a second time...(I got married and moved away <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/><br/><br/>Now you know what some of your kids do in school when they have crazy people like me in charge of art and recess!                        </div>

                            Interesting that kids play games all the time and We Are Not Invited.  Our presence as adults queers the pitch on multiple levels.  So what I want to see are games that do all those neat things, that don't need a stupid grown-up around to "facilitate".<br/><br/>EDIT:  Cross-posted with Shutupgirl before I read about her successful game facilitated by stupid grown-ups; no offense intended!                        </div>

<p>So, whenever these discussions come up, I quail at the appearance of terms like "simplified."</p>
<p>Kids don't need to be talked down to. Yeah, you need to understand that their terms are not the same as adult terms, but if a grade schooler can grasp the intricacies of Magic: the Gathering, then I don't think that we need to be lobotomising roleplaying games for him either.</p>

                            I said depending on the age...I have -never- in my life, talked down to a child.   Keep in mind that in my play-test, these are 3-6 year olds...not grade-schoolers. <br/><br/>Perhaps I take for granted that I simply accept them as little adults who are NOT adults.  (Also important to remember)<br/><br/>If you talk over their heads, they won't understand and will get frustrated...so while they may easily grasp concepts, it doesn't mean they'll always have the intense vocabulary that I've seen go into gaming designs...hell, *I* don't even have all that.   This isn' t just with children, I can say the same for new gamers, period...<br/><br/>So, when I say simplified...think of it as removing all of the wasted words that we don't really need in the first place...because kids, simply dont' waste words very often <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  They are very direct. the younger they are and expect you to be.<br/><br/>Also, I can promise you that while one grade-schooler might have learned the mechanics of complicated gaming, it doesn't mean everyone did..and I can guarantee that the one who did, didn't understand overnight.                        </div>

                            I'm hoping that <a href="">Console Legends</a> would be adaptable to kids without too much trouble, but it'll be a long time before it's done. As for what kind of skills you get from it, other than just creativity, you have to be able to pay attention to other people and work things they like into the story you're telling, or you don't get dice.<br/><br/>Teaching ethics (the way to apply their morals) sounds like a neat idea. You could have a good number of pre-made scenarios, taken from various existing sources, that they could play through and decide about. There's all sorts of existing material with tough ethics questions, with the liferaft problem being the standard one.<br/><br/>If I had kids, I think I'd want them in games that let them make their own rules (regular game rules and/or social rules) and then have to play with them for a little while, so they learn about consequences, what kinds of things they find fun (by seeing them excluded and being sad), how to think things out, and how to look for creative ways around things. I know, that last one would come back to bite me in the ass. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> That's only off the top of my head.                        </div>

                            I concur with Sara here.  My son is a darn bright 6-year-old, but he certainly can't play Magic: The Gathering or the Pokemon CCG or D&amp;D3.5 simply because of overly complex rules.  He plays Carcassone and Talisman.  <br/><br/>At the last ConQuest, I ran for a bunch of kids in the 6 to 12 range -- first a D&amp;D variant, and then Faery's Tale.  <br/><br/><b>Joshua BishopRoby</b> wrote: <i>So in this thread, Iâ€™d like to see two things: (a) what kinds of things do you want to see in RPGs for kids, and (b) maybe a little design-talk about how to provide this stuff.</i><br/><br/>Hm.  I'd divide RPGs for kids into a couple of categories.  There would "family games" which should be suitable for a wide age range.  They'd probably be aimed at having adults or older teenagers be the GM or at least leading play in some way.  [i]Faery's Tale[/i] is pretty good for this.  <br/><br/>The other is a game for kids to play with themselves.  This needs to have physical components and ready-to-use material.  Marvel Superheroes or the D&amp;D Basic Set are fair attempts at this.  I'd just like something well-designed in a genre I don't hate.  Having games for pre-teen kids at all would be a plus, though.                        </div>

                            I want to see games that kids are alos able to play by themselves. I'd also like to see games that encourage kids to set up situations by themselves and take on "GM-type" leadership, rather than making that the starting point style of play.<br/><br/>One of the things I often see that weirds me out a bit is when I go to more general rpg discussions and I see folks bemoaning either a lack of GMs around them, or trepidation at the idea of GMing themselves. I'd like to see games built that encourage players to step into and out of those sorts of roles regularly, and have the idea of a GM be an interesting variant.<br/><br/>Other than that, I'd like some recognition of the idea that kids' attitudes and interests can change fro pre-adolesence to adolescence, and see games geared towards that transition.<br/><br/>I think that early (12 ish) to teen period can benefit from some tactical/complex/heavy design. A lot of kids seem to love it in a way that younger and older audiences don't necessarily.                        </div>

                            I'm a children's librarian and I work with kids of pretty much all ages -- the children's room at my library is designated for ages 0-11, and some of the "bigger kids" come there, too.  I would love to figure out a way to introduce some of these kids to RPGs, but the most difficult thing has been time constraints; it's hard to get and keep  younger kids interested in something for more than an hour or so, and in addition the busiest time at my library is between school and dinner time, which is a fairly narrow margin.  I bought The Prince's Kingdom, and I would love to try playing it with some kids, but I'm not convinced it can be run in a short enough time period.  I also can't count on having the same kids around from one week to the next, so longer term campaigns are also difficult.                        </div>

                            Josh,<br/><br/>I've been thinking of this a little, because our circle of local friends have mostly all popped out their first kids, and they're heading for two years old, and now newly I'm an aunt of a 16 month old (yay!). So it's going to be something that is going to come up over the next few years.<br/><br/>-I'd like to see something that help kids talk about bullying: in handling a situation where they are being bullied, helping to understand why bullies bully, and in warding off the tendency to bully others. <br/>-I'd like games that give practice in exercising tolerance, acceptance and openminded-ness.<br/>-I'd like a game that actively works to build up confidence.<br/>-I'd like games that encourage children to find the good that came out of bad circumstances and work towards building a sense of perspective.<br/>-I'd like games that practice social responsibility locally to make them listeners and sensitive contributers and hone empathy skills.<br/>-I'd like games that practice social responsibility globally to further an understanding about active participation in making the world a better place by helping others, finding a voice and having the courage to stand up when something is Wrong.<br/>-I'd like games that build an understanding of personal respect for oneself and for other people while resisting the false expectations of the world.<br/>-I'd like a game that I can play with a kid before 10 that will help them learn me: that I will be an ally for life and that there's never anything that could happen that we couldn't get through together.<br/><br/>And the challenging part: I want all of those games to be fun to play, both for me and the kid.<br/><br/>And for design? I haven't got there yet but I'll think on it. However, one thing I do know: after Brand picked up the new Magic game with the comic intros, I'm positive that in making the games, we have to design start up systems like training wheels that will facilitate moving  kids into the procedures before they run with it.                        </div>

                            Thanks for pointing me here, Mark.  I need to make it a point to come over here to Story Games more often.<br/>
<br/>
As evidenced from the link Mark included above I started out my daughter with a sort of LARPing.  My very early attempts were modeled after the Dora the Explorer cartoon because she loved it.  Things fairly quickly evolved past that point and took a more fantasy bent.  I also discovered that I could put these "adventures" together on the fly pretty easily given the wide array of toys, outfits and stuffed animals at my disposal.<br/>
<br/>
Her first introduction to something resembling PnP gaming was almost a year ago when I got the Descent boardgame from Fantasy Flight games.  It's a dungeon-crawl kind of game and she was instantly fascinated with all the colorful minis, character and equipement cards and multitude of counters.  The game is designed to be played competitvely between the players (who are trying to beat the scenario) and the "Overlord" (who is trying to beat the players).  But it didn't take much to alter the intent to be more like a traditional RPG.<br/>
<br/>
It didn't take long before she insisted on running the game for her mother and I ("I want to be the Game Master!").  She loves putting the snap-together dungeon tiles into whatever configuration she wants and populating the rooms with monsters and treasure.  I really think she's only a step away from being able to play (and ultimately run if she wants) a regular RPG game of some sort at the ripe old age of 5.<br/>
<br/>
A side benefit that I anticipated and was realized was the educational factor.  Descent uses a dice mechanic that determines hits, damage and range all in a single roll of multiple d6's.  She learned a LOT of math by virtue of counting up the pips on the dice, subtracting the armor of the creature being hit and noting the remainder as its remaining hit points.  I think it is no coincidence that she just got her first report card ever and is performing above grade level in math.<br/>
<br/>
To say that this whole process has been a delight for me would be an understatement.  I'm fully aware that RPG's may not be a hobby she chooses to pursue long term and that's fine.  I'm not trying to force it on her.  But I'm glad she's got the foundation laid if she does want to continue and regardless, she's learned a lot along the way.                        </div>

If someone comes up with test subjects, let me know. One of my big stalling points in the game I was designing wa an inability to test with more than just my daughter and myself.                        </div>

                            Actually...Yes.<br/><br/>Due to my overwhelming need to focus on my expanding business, I will be attempting to remove my tuesda satarting january from a work schedule and go back to teaching only on Tuesday Nights...this time, at Lifetime Fitness. (because it's simply a three hour block, if I teach two classes, and a two hour block if I teach one...)   I'm going to teach Rock-Climbing but every week we get "Gym" Time and "Climb Time"   Part of this gym time could be learning and playing games, or I could simply use it in another class that concentrates on social and learning skills..<br/><br/>I think RPG games for children should be designed to be physical, mental AND Social...(like with the game where my kids didn't have to run, but did alot)   However, I could in theory, play-test these games of yours if I go back to teaching as planned.<br/><br/>False Modesty aside, I have an unusual knack with children, so as long as I think the game can be adapted without too much trouble (Older children can prep during the week like homework, younger kids need games that either evolve over time, (adding new rules AS you play), or simple rules to begin with.), I could, in theory, playtest those games...<br/><br/>But, as I'm going to be pretty swamped during my own playtest, here's what I propose.<br/><br/>I let you guys know if I go back to teaching...and you have from then (January), until about May to get your games sorted out, written and solidified.<br/>Then I will need you to send me the game, with complete instructions.  My play groups would tend to be 3-6, and 6-12, (for the older group, I will need two sets of instructions.   A kid friendly version for the 6-12 year olds, and one for me)<br/><br/>Since I'd be doing the work of playtesting, I'll be looking to make you write my prep-work, which means I also need a single page that would be speaking to parents and or strangers of what the game is/we are doing and what it intends to teach, etc, etc.<br/><br/>If this works well, AFTER my own playtest is down, I would very happily do the work of composing a bunch of games into a single book, and doing the leg-work to get it picked up and published by someone, (depending on the overall content of the book, quite possibly a scholastic publishing press that will also distribute)<br/><br/>What I would ask, is that the proceeds be allowed to be donated to either "Big Brothers and Big Sisters of America", or a similar charity...which we could handle simply by every person who submits a game for THIS book, signing a waiver saying they are donating thier portion that way.  -Everyone would keep publishing rights of the individual games and could do what they wanted with them-<br/><br/>Thoughts?                        </div>

They have alot of energy and need to move, the more they get to move, the better.   Teams, groups, etc work best for this age.  Think of two versions when you write a game, because then you appeal to parents and to the teacher sorts...Think big group first and then modify it down to work on a 1-1, or 3-1 basis.<br/><br/>For 6-12 year olds, get creative.  Physical is ALWAYS a plus as far as kids are concerned, but this doesn't mean these guys have to run either.  Just not sitting down is a plus.      There could be an 8-12 age range too, this one could sit a bit, if it's that sort of game. I get a new batch of kids every 6-10 weeks, and the ages don't always span out, which means I'll select games that I think will work best for the specific group.<br/><br/>I'll know in January what my schedule is like.<br/><br/>Sara                        </div>

                            I'd say that starting small is really important, that you have to concentrate on an age and stage of learning is important. Brand says there's an old saying in education: every grade is a dog's age.  I'd say that for this, younger is better. The preschool set is the place to start. <br/><br/>I also think that there are cues that can be gotten by picturebooks and learning centre games for kids. Repetition and ritual are critical to this age range. Key phrases will get you more mileage here than they will in Polaris. Kids in this age learn be re-doing and re-stating. Most don't have the capacity yet to start from scratch, but they're all about amalgamating. <br/><br/>Early in this band, they will more likely tell you a story they will already know and may swap only one element of the story to make it their own. They might not tell or adapt the full story depending on their attention, retention or forecasting abilities. They may retell the story of the Very Hungry Caterpillar using an ant, for example, but may stop after the Caterpillar has eaten all the junk food because that's only the part  they remember, or that's the part they like, or they may go on, and realize too late that an ant doesn't turn into a butterfly, so just end the story. Or, realism and continuity,  not often being high on the list of kid story priorities, might turn the ant into a butterfly anyway.<br/><br/>I wonder if maybe you could base a game that draws on the child's own experience by using one or two or three of their favorite picture books as a to harvest elements with - a storytelling exercise in which elements are pulled from other stories in a sort of mosaic meets Mad Lib. Alternately, story cards, like a simplified Everway might be an interesting way to approach the construction of a game. With pictures of easily identified objects: princess, prince, dragon, castle, horse, in a fairy tale game, giving kids familiar options to move a story forward. Letter cards might be used to find elements that start with a letter that could be introduced in the story. Similarly, feltboards or magnets would also be an interesting way to go.<br/><br/>The keys are to keep it simple, structured, with lots of room for exploration and the expectations of the adults low. "Correcting" the child in the creation of story at this age is a powerful action, and it's important to be aware of what message you're sending as you send it. Which, like, you already know already, but I'm thinking it through as I type.<br/><br/>It's also important to remember that kids advance so differently from each other. I knew kids at seven years that couldn't read full sentences or tell a story with a simple beginning middle and end, and I was playing full campaigns of AD&amp;D with a teenage group at Harbourfront. Maybe some way for the facilitating adult to do simple assessments of the child's ability and inclination would be an interesting addition.<br/><br/>As far as playtesting is concerned, I'd say though that's down the road, you might want to check your local library, community center or YMCA. All would probably welcome someone (especially someone who used to be a teacher) setting up a program on Saturday afternoons. Or, if you wanted something smaller, then you could probably <a href="http://www.fairgame-rpgs.com/comment.php?entry=90" rel="nofollow">make like Emily and Meg and set up something with a local school</a>.                        </div>

                            Does anyone remember where the actual play link was for the game at a con where a few kids showed up with their parents?  Originally the GM was dismayed, but he was so blown away by the fresh approach the kids took to roleplaying that he ended up saying it was the best game he had at the entire con.<br/><br/>I was telling my wife about it, but I couldn't find it.

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mo</cite>-I'd like to see something that help kids talk about bullying: in handling a situation where they are being bullied, helping to understand why bullies bully, and in warding off the tendency to bully others.<br/>-I'd like games that give practice in exercising tolerance, acceptance and openminded-ness.<br/>-I'd like a game that actively works to build up confidence.<br/>-I'd like games that encourage children to find the good that came out of bad circumstances and work towards building a sense of perspective.<br/>-I'd like games that practice social responsibility locally to make them listeners and sensitive contributers and hone empathy skills.<br/>-I'd like games that practice social responsibility globally to further an understanding about active participation in making the world a better place by helping others, finding a voice and having the courage to stand up when something is Wrong.<br/>-I'd like games that build an understanding of personal respect for oneself and for other people while resisting the false expectations of the world.<br/>-I'd like a game that I can play with a kid before 10 that will help them learn me: that I will be an ally for life and that there's never anything that could happen that we couldn't get through together.<br/><br/>And the challenging part: I want all of those games to be fun to play, both for me and the kid.<br/><br/>And for design? I haven't got there yet but I'll think on it. However, one thing I do know: after Brand picked up the new Magic game with the comic intros, I'm positive that in making the games, we have to design start up systems like training wheels that will facilitate moving kids into the procedures before they run with it.</blockquote>
There's lots of games that aim to do just these things, but they're not called roleplaying games.  Possibly because of stigma, possibly because they tend to be short things that go for 15-20 minutues max, because the target ages tend to have low tolerance limit for any activity, no matter how much fun it is.<br/><br/>For example, I've been using a pack called <a href="http://www.guidesvic.org.au/Program%20Skills%20for%20life.pdf" rel="nofollow">Skills for Life</a> with my brownie guides recently.  This is a pack developed by Guides Australia to increase resilence among kids, and is full of activity sheets and short games and activites.  Like roleplaying out little skits with a couple of peers to practice listening skills, or self-esteem, or how to deal with bullying.  For example, we recently did a quick game on bullying, that involved the girls writing things that a bully can do on paper arrows, making a paper shield, and then throwing the former at each other while using their shields to deflect them, shouting out what they'd do to protect themselves against that sort of bullying and striking heroic poses.<br/><br/>One question I have is why teach these things through a roleplaying game?  It may be the best way, but I think it's a question that needs answering.  Additionally, my experience has been that it's best to have little formal rules for such activities.  Arguing over what dice gets rolled can easily distract from getting to the meat of things.  And if you're aiming to teach listening/team work/empathy, I wonder if rules, particular if they govern exactly those things, might stop kids developing the practical skils themselves.  For example, my brownie guides have a peer leader for every 5-6 of them.  They elect these, and no only do they run the elections, but they decide the rules by which the election is held.  They sometimes hate it and want me to tell them what voting method to pick, and I push them back into discussing it amongst themselves because they learn group decision making.  They sometimes don't like it exactly because it's a hard skill that you only learn by doing.<br/><br/>I'm rambling, I think I'm coming down with a cold.  In summary, this is a cool area, there's lots of resources out there doing similar things that aren't labelled roleplaying games, and I think it's important to consider how important it is that it's a roleplaying game in comparison to how important it is that it develops the target skills.<br/><br/>Claire                        </div>

                            Claire,<br/><br/>Do they have to be roleplaying games? Maybe not, but availability of a wider variety of means to get these skills through to children and let them practice it, the more chance you have of getting through and getting it to stick. A kid who might not respond to your arrows and shield game might respond to an RPG version of the same. It could be a preference for a type of interaction, it could be a learning style, but the variety of tools means a wider chance of getting there. Josh isn't suggesting that RPG games should replace the games you're talking about, but that they should be available to compliment them.<br/><br/>Some other points:<br/><br/>A roleplaying game need not be about an issue (like say, bullying) to get the message through. Many pointed skillbuilding games and activities for kids take a didactic approach to the subject, like the example you mention: here kids, this is what bullying is, and this is how you can arm yourselves against it. This is a good thing. It provides a message of support from the facilitator and gives the child an official skill and an official sanction from an important role model to deal with the issue. An RPG can be about something that seems entirely unrelated, but it can give practice and instruction in dealing with the issue nonetheless, integrating the message with play, and letting it absorb on an entirely different level.<br/><br/>In RPG's kids play someone else, and by playing someone else, they can get closer to an issue without having to get scared by it. Just like in bibliotheraputic books, identification with a character bears the hard burden for the child and provide the child with a whole different level of absorption, in an RPG, this goes one step further as the child interacts through the safety of the character, and thereby accumulates confidence with which to explore the issue.<br/><br/>In RPG's kids play against a concrete opposition. Realism can be extremely important to making the issue seem emotionally real, and to building a concrete sense of emotional empowerment. In the arrows and shields game, there is no risk, nor any realism to the game. The only possible failure in coming out of the game is that my peers or role models will not think that I have done well. In an RPG, the kid has a bullying figure right there to deal with, and the very real possibility that the bully could win. The impact when the child does win is therefore more lasting and more intense, and the child has had to apply the skills in the simulation of a real environment. Being able to use the skills when there is real fear and real risk with a real bully will transfer more easily than if the child has learned the skills in an abstracted way.<br/><br/>There's a time and place and a kid for both methods, and why would we limit the tools in the arsenal?                        </div>

                            Important things to remember.<br/><br/>Teenagers are old enough to know already whether they want to get into gaming...the idea for children is getting them to that step in the first place.<br/>First, you make it okay to play make believe, then you make it okay to pretend to be someone else...then you make it okay to pretend to be somewhere else and doing something else...or perhaps be on a 'mission'...<br/><br/>Then as they get older, RPG's with dice, boards, etc...It's just the logical next step..because it reminds you fo those things.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm just going from experience.    Don't get me wrong, I like board and card games just fine, but for me, an RPG isn't an RPG unless you can tell a story with it.<br/>DnD for me, was always 'one step up' from monopoly and clue...PTA style games and LARP's were more my speed.<br/><br/>Also, anything involving weapons, fighting, etc, is just a danger zone when writing for kids...and can be asking for trouble.                        </div>

                            There exisits somewhere a fantastic 'curriculum' that an old friend of mine wrote called Build a City. It worls kind of like this:<br/><br/>Start out with a full-size sheet of plywood, or the largest poster-board you can find. If you have the space, use the wood. <br/>Get a bunch of wooden blocks, solid colors are ok, and sawed up scrap lumber is fine.<br/><br/>Use Sharpies (best on unfinished wood), stickers, and paint to make the blocks into the buildings in your city. Discuss what kind of city this is, and how many people live here. Are there enough schools, stores, hospitals, fire stations, etc for your city? Is there a jail? How do people deal with law-breakers? What kinds of laws will your city have?<br/><br/>Use sheets of paper, scissors, and whatever else you like to make trees, statues, play grounds, etc. What sort of holidays do your people celebrate? What sports do they play? What crops and animals grow in and around your city? How is land use determined? Duct tape makes a good road.<br/><br/>Then, once you have your City, each session starts with What's Happening (decided by the adult/leader/GM):<br/>There's a fire that destroys a home; where will the family live and what happens to them?<br/>There's a parade; how will we reroute traffic?<br/>Two schools are in a close rivalry in sports - how do the communities get involved?<br/>etc, etc, etc<br/><br/>This scales really well between two kids and a grown-up and a group of up to 50 kids of varuous ages - just scale What's Happening up if more people need some part to work on.<br/><br/>Be prepared to talk alot, and for the kids to be in author-stance rather than being 'in character'. It's elaborate make-believe with very little rules and the only mechanic is 'come to consensus'. It can keep you busy for two hours a week all school-year.                        </div>

                            My sister is a schoolteacher, and did a very similar exercise (model village) with her class in an economically disadvantaged area of the city. They did it in several groups.<br/><br/>The first building each group put in was a Social Welfare office. Because that's where the money comes from, right?<br/><br/>Which was a learning opportunity right there.<br/><br/>Mo, what's a bibliotherapeutic book? Is it a specific thing or just a book that helps kids work through issues by being the story it is?                        </div>

                            Hi Mike,<br/><br/>Bibliotherapy is a process where kids read books that are about a subject matter that they are struggling with (E.g. divorce) . The book can be designed specifically for the purpose or could be just a suitable fiction book. Usually, the most successful bibliotherapy books are ones with a character that is in someway like the child, to facilitate identification with the protagonist. The child undergoes catharsis as a result of identification with the protagonist's plight, and then on their own or with a leader (a librarian, or psychologist) the child works towards insight to build coping mechanisms about the issue.                        </div>
