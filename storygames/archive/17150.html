Particularly Classic Who stories in the vein of the 3rd-4th Doctor era.  Those stories were often as much mystery and horror stories as much as they were science fiction.<br/><br/>Not sure if it would be a problem to replicate the Doctor and Companions dynamic using this system.

It very much embraces the "uncover the mystery" style of story structure that was the foundation of classic Doctor Who stories, and I definitely felt it was important to never orient the mechanics so that information was conditional on die rolls. I've never played any Gumshoe games myself, but I think the "don't roll for clues" thing does make sense for a Doctor Who style game. (I'm not sure the rest of Gumshoe really does, though -- as I understand it, the "party" in a Gumshoe game represents a team of experts who showcase their talents by highlighting <i>who</i> notices things or gets information in a particular way, which I wouldn't think maps well to the "omni-competent Doctor and fish-out-of-water Companion" model).                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish" title="CoveredInFish"><img alt="CoveredInFish" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/940/nWJ86I3UKR7RA.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CoveredInFish">CoveredInFish</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389180/#Comment_389180" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T10:58:44+00:00" title="September  4, 2012 10:58AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fear Itself (another Gumshoe game) has a group of untrained, ordinary people and 1 or 2 experts. These probably arent "the Doctor" but could be a starting point for a hack. AFAIR these experts can buy skills the others arent allowed to buy - and have more points.<br/><br/>Gumshoe has a separated skill list for investigative and other skills. You automatically succeed in investigative skills when you're gathering necessary clues. You can pay from a pool to get additional clues or shine above the other players. For those other skills like fighting or driving you roll a die and can spend from a pool for a better chance to succeed. IMHO Gumshoe is less suited to action adventures, but Dr Who isnt so much action, so it might fit. <br/><br/>So ... I think you could make it work, but I dont see much in Gumshoe to support that special Dr Who feeling. Whether that would be easy to add or not I cannot say.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jacob" title="Jacob"><img alt="Jacob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jacob">Jacob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389182/#Comment_389182" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-04T11:06:12+00:00" title="September  4, 2012 11:06AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would lean towards using an InSpectres hack...

It's meant simply as a set of guidelines to handle the distribution of needful information to the players.<br/>A Gumshoe game will not work if you use that economy to restrict the distribution of clues and hints any more than just using it as a guide to see who gets what piece of information.<br/>It cannot, therefore, be a restrictive economy. It must allow for an extreme budget.<br/><br/>The second economy, the non-investigative skills, are where trouble sometimes arises.<br/>Since you can spend from the non-investigative skills to modify your rolls, those are the ones you want to have limited.<br/>Foresight/Preparedness is a prime example. You don't want someone prepared for every situation if you're trying to create tension. It's okay to have someone who is FREQUENTLY prepared, but the restriction that I think you're talking about JD has to come in there. If you want to create a sense of tension by limiting resources, players need pools that run out quickly and are hard to refresh... but only in NON-INVESTIGATIVE areas!<br/><br/>Taking this back toward Doctor Who:<br/>We want to see the neat monsters and weird space stuff, so it should be fairly easy to follow clues. You should have way more clue points than you'll ever need.<br/><br/>But those monsters have to be overpowering and scary, so you need a lot fewer non-clue-gathering points than you'd need to handle problems face on.  We're talking miniscule pools for things like gunplay and preparedness and spaceship piloting. Barely enough to handle one major enemy, let alone the full scale invasion you're going to face...<br/><br/>Oh, hey, that gives me an idea!<br/><br/>What if you do have absolutely pathetic non-clue-gathering skill pools (action and problem-solving skills) that you can only amp up by: running away and/or getting captured!

There are several things going on, at the level of the player and the character.<br/><br/>Looking at the abilities first, General abilities are about action. These are the areas in which failure is interesting or threatening. Players have enough points to guarantee success a few times in their best abilities and to look good, and most of the rest of the time, they'll have a 50/50 chance to win. It's risky, it's exciting. Excitement for the players is a key part of the roleplaying experience.<br/><br/>Investigative points serve several purposes. They give you core clues for free, the give you supplementary information about clues and they give you narratively loose benefits (loose in that they're not associated with clues and can be requested by a player or proposed by a GM, for example, in my three page demo, you can spend a point of Evidence Collection to put together an Arabic/English tome giving a pool of 2 points of Occult and 1 pt of Cthulhu Mythos).<br/><br/>But that's not all. Investigative spends bring the awesome. If you have to spend a point for something, it's going to be something good. If there's nothing to be had you can't even spend a point. So Investigative points equate to spotlight time.<br/><br/>And on top of that, Investigative points that the characters have are an indicator to the GM as to the kind of things players want to see in the game. If you've got 8 points in Occult, you're going to be seeing lots of occultists, trying to understand the workings of mystical rituals, divining the correspondences between lines on the landscape and the tarot.<br/><br/>What Investigative abilities do is generate information and the reward for this information is danger and madness, which are both exciting, as well as story, narrative continuity and meaning. The instinct of the player often is to avoid danger and madness, after all these threaten their involvement in the game in the most direct way possible, by threatening the character. That's where the Drive comes in. At first it might seem as a punishment (or as Ken Hite puts it, a dubious stunted carrot) for the engaging with or avoiding the danger, but in practice what it does is create player buy-in and gives them permission to do awful things to their character. So if a player for example, chooses Curiosity as their drive, they can narratively justify their character investigating the awful screams in the basement. Without that justification, the narrative doesn't make any sense, just as it wouldn't in fiction.<br/><br/>Sources of stability and pillars of sanity give characters further narrative depth and provide post-hoc justification for their actions, as well as being targets for the GM. A player who says Love of Nature is their Pillar of Sanity is asking the GM to prove that this is not the case.<br/><br/>So what does the player do? The player plays their character using their character sheet as a guide, the character sheet that they have chosen, for what they would do in a way that satisfies whatever version of the investigative narrative they find themselves in. The game is all set up for this narrative enagement and drives the play towards that genre.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389602">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389602/#Comment_389602" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-07T22:50:48+00:00" title="September  7, 2012 10:50PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great analysis.

If see a lot of Photography and Surveillence on character sheets that tells me... well, actually, that tells me I'm going to have to teach players the reason they always have detective characters talking to one another about personal concerns during stakeouts. (In real life, detectives learn ways to sort of half go to sleep while watching a target. Surveillence is DULL.)<br/><br/>It's also used to decide WHICH player in a given scene to give a clue's interpretation to.<br/>If I've got a clue that has to do with forensics, for instance: The corpse has far too many beetles for a man who only vanished three days ago, then I'm going to give it to the guy who piled extra points into Forensics (because that guy must really want to look like some kind of Medical Examination Expert.)<br/><br/>I think there's a couple things that Gumshoe could (and should) have done differently.

You are focusing on points as tokens to get information which you think is hard coded to particular abilities, when in fact spends are in the main used to gain benefits other than leads, usually spends you suggest yourself.  Secondly, the issue of resources assigned in character generation ending up not being used in a particular game session is hardly confined to GUMSHOE, and in fact it allows for the redistribution of points from one ability to another as well as an initially unassigned pool of points. Third, you seem to think that specific information can only be gained with specific abilities; no; they can be gained with those abilities, but also as in other games with any other plausible skill which emerges from the fiction, usually through player action just as in many other games.<br/><br/>It's very clear from the way you describe what you think the system is that we've explained it rather poorly in the rules, because what you are describing is not the game as it was intended. Read Robin's articles on Page XX, which should disabuse you of the mistaken impression we have given you.<br/><br/>As for Dr Who, GUMSHOE would need new mechanics to deal with the setting (just as it does for other settings) but it would deal with the information side just fine.

You are buying more "face time" within a given realm of clue-gathering when you put more points in that investigative skill. You're also sending a message that you want more of those kind of clues in the game.<br/><br/>The ratio analogy doesn't work though.<br/>It's more like this:<br/><br/>If I have more points in a given investigative skill, I expect to get ALL MAJOR clues related to that field as long as there's one to get. If I want to show off or get extra clues, then I have to spend from that clue-gathering ability, making it less likely I'll be the one to get the important basic clues (the ones the team has to get to move the game on to the next encounter.)<br/><br/>The problem with this, of course, is the temptation to over-specialize. Since the amount you put into a given field of investigation should determine, roughly, the number of clues the GM adds of that type to his or her list, then you could conceivably make a game all about finding nothing but, say, photographic clues or stake-outs (which would make the game into one of my least favorite Richard Dreyfus - Emilio Estevez movies.)<br/><br/>To my knowledge, there is no mechanic which balances this out, although I'd like there to be one.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_391400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/391400/#Comment_391400" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-26T04:14:56+00:00" title="September 26, 2012  4:14AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 26, 2012 4:15AM by Simon_Rogers.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote>That's a great analysis. I agree the Drive makes a huge difference. The "merely" professional reasons in Mutant City Blues don't really push as hard and the lack of a sanity/pillars system loses a lot of the constraint that Trail of Cthulhu puts on the characters.<br/></blockquote></blockquote>\nMCB is certainly more procedural than Trail, but that's intentional.<br/><br/>In Mutant City Blues, the important character button is Defects. Powers can be associated with mental or physical disorders. If you push your powers, you can trigger a crisis which makes your condition worsen.<br/><br/>For example, if you've chosen Regeneration and Healing from the Quade Diagram, you have an incipient Messiah Complex, which should inform your roleplaying.<br/><br/>In addition, each character has three sub-plot suggestions with the GM incorporates into spolight scenes and episodes. As for Drives, you can certainly introduce them, but the central conceit of the game is more than enough to make PCs do what they are supposed to do in my experience.\n<blockquote><br/>If I have more points in a given investigative skill, I expect to get ALL MAJOR clues related to that field as long as there's one to get.

Anyone with an ability can get a clue. I could be wrong - let me know if this is stated anywhere. Obviously, if it's a benefit, you need the points, but there is no specific rule which I know of where the person with the highest rating always gets the clues. You do it by who is in the scene, who asks the right questions, etc. There might be circumstances where the GM might favour the expert over the generalist in order to choose who gets information (if, say its an Evidence Collection search on a room and there is only one piece of info) but no rule for this. <br/><br/>A higher rating simply gives you more opportunity to get a spotlight with the skill. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
