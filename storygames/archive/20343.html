It's a process I've found satisfying and thought it might be useful to share. <br/><br/>The system is meant to provide a structured approach to writing fiction during those parts of a game when you are not engaging with creative aids (what are known as gm emulators/oracles, idea generators, etc, in the solo rpg niche).<br/><br/>The kind of feedback I'm looking for is stuff like how clear are the ideas coming through, do the current examples help, any holes you see (which means I left something implied and haven't realized it yet), etc or any other constructive feedback you can think of. Of course, if you do give it a test drive, let me know how you liked the experience.  <br/><br/>The draft is at google docs: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hXMIYl-3qr4wAmxAqXx8rfcWfO82soBWpYhvZb_puzs/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow"><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23WritingWithDice&amp;Mode=like">#WritingWithDice</a></a> draft. If you have any questions also let me know. <br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>p.s. I've enabled comments for people with this link, if you prefer to write feedback there.

It applies more to people who write down their thoughts as prose when they solo rpg (others keep the story in their heads with perhaps a few notes).<br/><br/>I also feel like playing solo is closer to GM preparation, blue booking and pbp than it is to a live face to face session. I consider those to be cousins of creative writing. \n<blockquote><br/><br/>As for the system it seems like a lot to work out before hand when it could be done along side the adventure.

If you start without them, and considering statements in the scene to be Principles, Step 4 is undermined, IMO. <br/><br/>On the other hand, one of the variations I sometimes play with is to have a "free" introduction scene that's works as an introduction to the character and his world. Then I extract Principles from there. Would this alternative make it feel less of a hurdle? <br/>\n<blockquote><br/>Is this for use with a pre-published module or is this for more freeform writing/solo play?<br/></blockquote>\nI don't use it for pre-published modules, unless I'm cannibalizing those for setting information and ideas to use as Principles (and to generate assumptions of the setting in my head). <br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448330">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy" title="chaiboy"><img alt="chaiboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/368/nWWEJX1TT1UNK.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/chaiboy">chaiboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448330/#Comment_448330" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-09-03T18:51:06+00:00" title="September  3, 2015  6:51PM">September 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see your point.

The constraints themselves are supposed to push you to make contact with the RPG rules system you are using when you want to include something outside of the focus of Principles.<br/><br/>Thank you for your comments. I'm glad it comes across clearly. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
