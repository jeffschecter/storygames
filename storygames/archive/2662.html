Perhaps, it may encourage some other people to do similar things.<br/><br/>Background: In 2005 I discovered story-games and reactivated my activity as an RPG gamer. I formed a more or less stable group of 3-5 people to play those "strange" games I was buying abroad, and to learn how to play them (I'm still on it, of course).<br/><br/>The big thing started after the 2005 Ronnie's. I really liked the concept of Hierarchy (by Troy_Costisick). I tried to give him as much feed-back as possible. During spring 2006 I wanted to organize a play-test. I contacted some people from a local RPG club. They were involved in the organization of PuCLN, a national Spanish game-meeting to be held in June, 2006. They had never heard about most of the games I was talking about, but they were eager to experiment and play something with the background of Hierarchy.<br/><br/>The day they invited me to their club, to do the playtest,  more and more gamers (experienced and newbies) got interested and joined. Finally, we were 14 people. The feedback was really good. Moreover, some people were amazed about the game mechanics and procedures. They were completely new to story-games ideas. A nice talk started after the session and continued for an hour about story-games in general.<br/><br/>Lately, in June, during the PuCLN meeting, I organized short sessions of some games (MLwM, PtA, Universalis, Polaris, Inspectres, and DitV). Some of the former play-testers were looking for it, still intrigued by our talk. And they brought some more people with them. In most of the sessions, they were around, as players or lurkers. I would say that those sessions were a complete blast for many. There was even a Spanish publisher interested on one of the games for translation, but after a time I heard of that project no more (a real pity).<br/><br/>I keep more or less in contact with most of those players, those who live in my city. In Christmas, they wanted to buy games, and I organized a joined order to IPR of around 300$ (to share and minimize shipping costs). They are still asking me for help to buy PDFs or other products from time to time. I know some of them are getting into story-gaming happily, playing on their own, sharing their experiences with other people, and creating their own playing groups.<br/><br/>They are not so many, but it is a good start, I think. Now, there are a couple of small story-gaming communities around. It is really a good feeling.<br/><br/>Do you have similar stories?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61249/#Comment_61249" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-15T15:47:32+00:00" title="March 15, 2007  3:47PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's really cool. In my case I focused on rules availability and the language barrier. I translated some free RPGs--Risus, Wushu, FATE, TSoY, Nicotine Girls, the playtest version of 1001 Nights, and most recently the playtest version of Revisionist History--on my blog. These are of course useful for the games I run, since it beats explaining the rules myself. But people also read them and use them in their own games without any real contact with me. I know there was a campaign set in 15th-century Spain using the FATE rules. I also write lots of reviews on my blog and I know at least one person who bought Dogs in the Vineyard based on my review. I've generated some interest in Spirit of the Century as well, it seems. <br/><br/>Pairing story games with popular genres and settings seems one way to get people interested. Westerns don't have a big presence in Korea, but when I advertised for a Star Wars campaign using Dogs in the Vineyard I had more signups than I could handle. Pulp is another low-profile genre in the region. But when I floated around the idea of Spirit of Steel, a campaign using Spirit of the Century in the very pulpy anime Full Metal Alchemist (The Steel Alchemist) setting, I could see eyes lighting up right away.<br/><br/>Finally, like Arturo I've run lots of games off the beaten track (MLwM, FATE, Trollbabe, Cat...) and people have enjoyed them tremendously. They tell me it's because I'm a great GM and that gives me a warm fuzzy feeling in my heart, but I suspect that they're reacting at least in part to the different principles involved and the amount of control they're being given. <br/><br/>Once, when I wondered out loud why people wanted to play games that were so different from D&amp;D or GURPS, one interesting answer I got was that it was <i>because</i> these games weren't D&amp;D or GURPS. Humans are creatures of habit but gamers are also a curious lot, and they're often open to experimentation. And since the experience wasn't horrid they're willing to return to it. So I'd say I've made this different mode of rules and play a viable choice for some folks in the community. And having my fun in the process, of course, which is what really counts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61262/#Comment_61262" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-15T18:08:54+00:00" title="March 15, 2007  6:08PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Heya,<br/>\n<br/>\nAll I have to say is how awesome this is, and it just shows how appealing Story Games are to people.  If they try it, they'll like it.  I hope we see more and more of this over the next few years.

I think the majority of players like the less constraining style. Of course, it's not for everyone--one guy tried it and didn't like it. No problem at all in itself, but he seems to have some kind of problem with the whole concept, which was...strange. How can one feel threatened by a playstyle? <br/><br/>(Aside: This guy is my GM in a campaign I play in, which I <a href="http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?referrerid=&amp;t=308728" rel="nofollow">begged off</a> of because of creative differences. He keeps a pretty tight rein over the story, has some mondo NPCs that constrain how much the PCs can affect the campaign world, tends to shoot down player suggestions, etc. Plus, his combat-centrism just wasn't to my tastes.)<br/><br/>Anyhow, this guy seems to think storygaming is going to ruin the hobby or the players or something and that it'll never catch on. I can kind of see the second proposition, but it seems to conflict with the first proposition... how the heck can I ruin the hobby with what's only a tiny subsection in an already tiny hobby? I wonder if he thinks I should never run story games at all?<br/><br/>In summary, some people just seem to have a problem with the idea of story gaming. No idea why--I don't have a problem with people playing miniature games, or GURPS, or anything else on the face of the planet (unless maybe if it's FATAL or RaHoWa, heh). I must confess, I've never thought of myself as a threat to the hobby before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child" title="fifth_child"><img alt="fifth_child" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://forum.rpg.net/image.php?u=8366&amp;dateline=1157831572"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fifth_child">fifth_child</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61322/#Comment_61322" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T11:06:35+00:00" title="March 16, 2007 11:06AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dude, you're totally a nihilist and an insurgent.

Everyone who has been exploiting railroading and ilusionist style a lot, may feel a little unsafe when facing a complete different way of doing things which seems to imply a loss of control on the one who previously had the responsability to make the things work.<br/><br/>Most of my old players were thinking that these games were not surely going to work well because it was impossible to create a good story without the direction of a good GM. At first, we were not understanding that the rules may do this work. In other previous games, the lack of system to create story was forcing the GM to take the job.<br/><br/>This is the reason I try to avoid talking about theory to new players, until they try and see by themselves how it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
