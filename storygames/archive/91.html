                    Grey Ranks is about the 1944 Warsaw Uprising, from the point of view of Polish teenagers.  I've structured the game into twelve scenes, and each scene corresponds to a particular point in time.  For example, scene nine takes place on August 14, the situation is read out loud, and the players (after some other stuff not relevant here) go on a mission together and maybe die.<br/><br/>Up until now I've had a "mission builder" in the game, with various elements and corresponding points to reflect the increasing horror and intensity of the uprising.  So you'd go:<br/><br/>"OK, scene nine, I need nine points ... how about a mission in Zoliborz on Citadel bridge (1+3) involving combat (5)..."<br/><br/>This seems unneccessary, and I'm wondering if I should just replace it with a canonical list of missions for each scene to choose from, like:<br/><br/>"SCENE NINE<br/>1:  Zoliborz, in the north, the Stoleczna neighborhood.  Hold off a concerted German thrust to give women and children time to flee across Citadel bridge toward the Russian lines past Praga.  <br/>2:  Ochota, in the southwest.  The auxiliary telephone exchange. Find a way to enter and demolish this heavily-defended communication choke point.   <br/>3:  Ã…Å¡rÃƒÂ³dmieÃ…â€ºcie, the Litewska neighborhood.  RONA, the "Russian National Liberation Army", is a group of volunteers organized by Russian engineer Bronislaw Kaminski.  His 10,000 men are murderous thugs, collaborators, and deserters - the worst of the worst.  Naturally the unit has been converted into an SS-Sturmbrigade by the German high command.  They have arrived in Warsaw, and the Home Army has launched a massive raid on their encampment."<br/><br/>Etc, etc. maybe ten per scene to choose from.<br/><br/>I see advantages and disadvantages to both approaches.  I worry that players will feel out at sea if asked to concoct a plausible "mission" from lists of elements.  If I provide that structure, it is one less thing a player needs to worry about, and also provides a shared framework for everybody who plays the game (something I love about the Roach).  <br/><br/>Thoughts?                </div>

                            From my limited playtest experience, I genuinely enjoyed the mission building aspect of the game.  Hell, I enjoyed it so much that, based on the first playtest alone, I stole... er 'borrowed' the idea for another design that's percolating in my noggin.<br/>
<br/>
I'd only suggest getting the whole mission-building thing down two one or two pages, so that these can be a seperate handout for the person who's currently building the mission.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, or maybe even a one-page to fit the B-side of the character sheet?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Eric Likes It.<br/>

                            Thanks, Eric.  Related question - I care <em>a lot</em> about this game's ground truth.  I think that impacts my design decisions.   In a way I don't want to let go and allow the players to create their own Warsaw out of what I've written, and I'm not sure if that is toxic or not.  I absolutely dread the actual play post that reads like a Rat patrol episode, you know?  That's 100% not what I'm after.  So how much does "what I'm after" matter?  How much structure enhances the experience, and where's the line that, when crossed, chokes the life out of it?                        </div>

                            Ooh.  Tough question.<br/>
<br/>
Lemmie ask you a question;<br/>
<br/>
Wasn't the game supposed to be about love during wartime?  Using the setting of Warsaw 1944 and the Boyscouts/Girlguides as a tool to achieve that goal?  Because I don't seem to remember you telling me all about how cool it would be to have stories that revolve around Warsaw, just love and war.<br/>
<br/>
If I'm correct, then wanting everyone to play Warsaw the way you imagine it, or the way it happened, is totally inconsequential IMO.  You should expect actual play posts that include your core elements.  If Warsaw, the way you see it, is really a core element, then I think you would be reasonable to expect to see that in all the AP posts.<br/>

                            Jason, I think you should write out those ten samples per scene (that's 120 scenes -- a lot of writing) and then offer the one- or two-page mission builder as an 'advanced' option.  That way your readers will get a good sense of what sort of stuff exists, and what kind of mood and flavor they should be going for, but also have the option of doing their own thing.<br/>
<br/>
Cause if you don't give them the option of doing their own thing, they'll do it anyway.  But give them a little toolset to play with, and they'll do their own thing based on good guidelines, and informed by the samples you provide.                        </div>

                            Thanks, guys.  There's no reason I can't do both, actually, and if I put my Joe Gamer hat on, I know I'd enjoy creating my own, as Eric already mentioned.   <br/><br/>Eric, it's not a matter of "my" Warsaw as much as Warsaw as it was.  That's important to me - honoring ground truth as much as possible - and I'm not sure how to impress that upon people in my text.  I recognize that ultimately I have no control over how people choose to use my game or parse my ideas.  Also, the game won't fall apart if it becomes the Rat Patrol with teen sex, so maybe it is presumptuous of me to even wring my hands about it.                        </div>

                            This is based on about 10 minutes of thought, so, y'know, take it for what it's worth.<br/><br/>My take on what you mean by the game being about Love and War is that Love is what gives people the strength to get through the horrors imposed by War, yes?<br/><br/>So then the things people Love - Love of country, Love of religion (in this case Judaism), romantic Love, Love for Friends, Love for treasured items, etc. should be the character's source of strength.  In game mechanics, this means that, when a player can draw something his/her character loves into a conflict, the player gets a bonus to her/his roll.  Sort of DitV-style.<br/><br/>But War wants to take these things away from the character.  That's the heart of the conflict.  How I would model that is by providing the players the option of permanently sacrificing an object of Love (in mechanics terms, marking it off of the character sheet) for a one-time HUGE bonus to a conflict role.  When the character is in deep shit, the only way to get out of it is to sacrifice something you Love.<br/><br/>When a character sacrifices his/her last object of Love, it triggers endgame for that character.<br/><br/>There's more stuff that would have to be added on to that (reward mechanics, frex), but I think that captures what you're trying to get at thematically.<br/><br/>If you get the mechanics right for the thematic stuff, I think all you should need to maintain loyalty to the real situation is enough color to let player's get hooked in.                        </div>

                            Weird, you've just described almost exactly how Grey Ranks works.  Seriously, weird.  It's solid and I think it works nicely, although I have it set up so that the loss of something you hold dear is a penalty for failure most of the time - choosing to sacrifice a Thing You Hold Dear is an option, but a very unattractive one.  <br/><br/>And FYI the Warsaw ghetto uprising was in 1943 - this game is mostly about Polish Catholic teens, although the liquidation of the ghetto is addressed and you can play a Jewish survivor if you want to.

My bad.  I just did a quick pop over to Wikipedia to grab a little context.<br/><br/>I don't blame you for wanting to avoid the Ghetto Uprising.  Hot button probably doesn't even begin to describe it.

Fair enough, but let me expand on my 'vision' a little bit, and see what you think. Note that some of what I'm presenting here is a result of your comments and looking at the information about the Uprising, and wasn't there at the time of the first post.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the characters have things that they Love. When you get right down to it, these are the reasons why the characters are fighting the Nazis in the first place, and are the root of the character's morale in the face of the horrors the Nazis are capable of. The items on the sheet are what the characters want to liberate.Their reasons for wanting to liberate those things are their own, and may or may not come out in the course of play.<br/><br/>Then comes crunch-time.  The characters find themselves in a horrible situation, and their life or something of tremendous 'objective' value, such as the lives of several other people or dozens of people's homes, are at stake.  The character cannot save him/herself, or the other stake, with their own, native pluck.  However, if they sacrifice something they hold dear, they have the ability to save the day (eg. sending the woman he loves on a suicide mission, abandoning a treasured possession to be plundered as a momentary distraction, etc.).  Doing so (probably) lets the character succeed, but it also destroys a little bit of their soul (less Love to draw upon during standard conflicts).<br/><br/>In the worst case scenario, eventually the character comes to the brink - only one oject of Love remaining on the Character Sheet.  And the next big crisis comes.<br/><br/>If the character doesn't sacrifice the last item of Love, some great horror occurs, or, perhaps, the character dies.  If the charater DOES sacrifce the last item, the character gets away alive, or staves off disaster, but is left a broken person with nothing left to fight for, except hatred over what the Nazis have cost him/her.  The character becomes a hollow shell, and, for our narrative purposes, useless or uninteresting, so the character is moved into endgame.<br/><br/>So the game, I hope, would become about how much you are capable of giving up in the face of losing your life, or other horrible consequences.<br/><br/>Now this is pretty dark.  At this point there isn't really any glimmer of hope for the characters, and therefore the players, and for this theme I don't think that's a good thing.  Therefore, we add a second, group, endgame - when the Soviets alive.  In retrospect, we know that this was not a wonderful thing, but it was better than the alternative of continuing mass death and destruction at the hands of the Nazis.<br/><br/>Frankly, I don't know how to implement this mechanically, right now.  Maybe something will hit me later, in which case I'll add it in another comment.<br/><br/>Now, your idea is that losing something you love will be a consequence of failure.  I can certainly see the logic of this - if you are fighting for the freedom of these things you love, and you fail, the most symbolic punishment is losing something that you love.<br/><br/>The problem, IMO, is that this is a story-game, and in that 'gamey' context, failure is a punishment in its own right.  You don't acheive what you are aiming for.  You don't move the Nazis that one inch closer to withdrawing from the city, or you don't make contact with that British or American emissary to the resistance.  You don't need the system telling you that you fucked up.<br/><br/>For my tastes, I prefer the idea of conflict between what you love and sacrifice for the greater good.<br/><br/>In the end though, I think it's all good, and my aim here is to help, not criticize.                        </div>

                            Oops.  Missed one point in the 'losing sucks' part of that last comment.<br/><br/>If you lose an object of love when you fail, I think you will have to go with a Karma-resolution system, because otherwise characters will be losing things they love, essentially, at the roll of the dice.  Yes, War is Hell, and War is Chaos, but those aren't the (primary) premises you want addressed in this game.<br/><br/>Because of that, I think that losing loved ones due to failure also undercuts [EDIT - has the potential to undercut if you're not very careful] the player's opportunity to address the game's premise.<br/><br/>Not that I actually know a bloody thing about designing systems for this sort of thing.

                            Thanks for your thoughts, Linnaeus, I appreciate it.  I'm still heavily revising the playtest draft but I'll see that you get a copy when it is ready, which won't be too far away.  <br/><br/>My "punishment/reward" thinking has been guided by the notion that mechanically, this is a game about avoiding failure rather than achieving success, because in the end you cannot win.  By scene twelve, in late spetember 1944, the Home Army has capitulated and you are either dead or a POW or a dead POW.  This is integral to the game and everybody knows it going in - how you get there is what matters, and what you lose along the way, and what you gain.                        </div>

<blockquote>Thanks for your thoughts, Linnaeus, I appreciate it. I'm still heavily revising the playtest draft but I'll see that you get a copy when it is ready, which won't be too far away. </blockquote>
That would be cool, although I kind of doubt that I would be able to do anything more than give it a look over, since I'm only about to introduce my group to TSoY, and that's going to be kind of a big step.  Grey Ranks might be too far "out there" for all but a couple of my players.<br/><br/>Also, about half of my play group (we're your typical playing together since high school group) are in the Canadian Navy, so even if they were all hard-core narrativists, the Poland Uprising might hit a little too close to home for some of them (horrors of war and all that).
<blockquote>My "punishment/reward" thinking has been guided by the notion that mechanically, this is a game about avoiding failure rather than achieving success, because in the end you cannot win. By scene twelve, in late spetember 1944, the Home Army has capitulated and you are either dead or a POW or a dead POW. This is integral to the game and everybody knows it going in - how you get there is what matters, and what you lose along the way, and what you gain.</blockquote>
Okay, I can buy that.  It is pretty dark, but no one ever said you had to design a game to be for everyone <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            I'll be interested in your thoughts, no testing required.  And yes, there's a big disclaimer in the game that lays out the lines and veils, and around what topics lines are basically impossible to implement, and suggests other games if that is a problem.                        </div>

                            Hey, it's taken a while but I've finally roughed out my vignette-and mission-building situation generators.  <a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/projects/games/grey_ranks/situation_generator_1.1.pdf" rel="nofollow">Take a look</a>.<br/><br/>The idea is that at the beginning of each scene (there are nine, across three acts), each player chooses a situation element (people, places, things, or events) and an orientation - youth or maturity.  Roll a d6 and write them all down - instant situation, borrowed directly from AG&amp;G.  This is where the documentary-style detail I feel is important in honoring the ground truth will come from - you don't need to know dick about the Warsaw Rising of '44 to get deep into the situation through color the lists provide.  This helps my conscience, because I am absolutely compelled to honor the reality I am offering up as entertainment.  <br/><br/>The missions are more fully baked and consistent than the vignettes right now - creating solid situation out of romantic possibility is harder than you might think.  Anyway, if you are interested take a look and give me some feedback.                        </div>
