Wearily of the elsewhere-mentioned shiny factor, I bought the PDF at RPGNow: Ten dollars don't hurt you right?<br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, I read the game twice, and I've written a review (<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://blog.mausdompteur.de/archives/178-316-Carnage-amongst-the-Stars.html" rel="nofollow">in german</a>). It's quite harsh when it comes to stressing the game's theme, which is overdone IMHO and turns me off to a degree.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, here's my gist: Yes, the game is a cool blend of all the war issues and SF movies you mention; and it gives people an easy, slightly tactical game to contrast  the character development/presentation scenes against. But the "Theme" and the "Focus" of the game; namely: <i>The guys who don't know what the war is about take all the shit</i> is splattered over the game without need or room for exploration of the whole thing. In that regard, you could have just written: "War sucks. Especially for the point men."<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I admint I might be a bit oversensitive. But I'm somehow missing the indie ideal of experiencing through play what the game <i>really</i> is about by making your very own choices \u2013 in other, possibly misconstrued words, there is no fruitful void in the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr is there?

It has the trappings of a war game, sure. And the trappings are cool and come with fun toys to play with. It's a game about soldiers, certainly, but not war.<br/><br/>Some powerful people decided that indiscriminate <i>murder</i> was the right answer to a hypothetical problem. Those powerful people -- who make the big picture decisions about what humanity should be up to in the cosmos -- they're not far-away NPCs that are outside the scope of play. Quite the opposite, in fact. Those positions of power and authority are sitting right there for the taking and will be the roles of the PCs in no time at all.<br/><br/>In <i>Poison'd</i>, Vincent puts it this way:<br/>"If your pirate becomes so foul and ruthless a sinner that you no longer want to play him, he leaves play. The second time any player's pirate leaves play, this is the game's final session, no choice to make."<br/><br/>In <i>3:16</i>, Gregor gives you The Device.<br/><br/>In another thread on DitV, people are talking about their Dogs going back to the home temple and having a few choice words with the Elders of the faith. It is oh so telling that few groups ever think to do that. All I could think of was the Brigadier's standing order in 3:16. And, of course, every PC's final Weakness.<br/><br/>I have more to say about standing orders, player buy-in, and military satire, but those will have to wait a bit.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears" title="Keith Sears"><img alt="Keith Sears" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/898/nD5UFQZP7YUY6.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith%20Sears">Keith Sears</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165093/#Comment_165093" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T19:54:23+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  7:54PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really hate wrting this.<br/>\n<br/>\nI loathed the game on the first session. I doubt that I will ever play it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe session was run by Ralph Mazza, and he put together a scenario that was a combination of Starship Troopers (The movie version) and Pitch Black. My sargeant was slaughtered by the flying manta-rays and Seth Ben-Ezra's Corporal survived the fight.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy did my character die? Am I just bitter about a character death? No. He died because I gave up. I could have pulled out some memory to save him, but I didn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe was a disgusting little human being on a disgusting mission to conduct a wave of genocide across the universe. I didn't give a damn about him and it became clear that things would only get worse if he survived and the mission continued. It was a mercy killing.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game works. The system is fast and easy. I'm sure that anyone that reads the book would chuckle with wicked glee at the universe that the game creates. You are a cog in the great machine that is eradicating all life in order to make the universe safe for humanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nSorry, but I just cant' bring myself to dip my brain in that again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165095/#Comment_165095" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T19:58:34+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  7:58PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That was actually my only complaint about 3:16's text.

Certainly I won't make any final conclusions before experimenting a little further. But, our group seems to appreciate the irony in the 3:16's fiction even without explicit mechanics to work with the theme, so we're good with going on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165140/#Comment_165140" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T22:29:33+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 10:29PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2008 10:30PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've now played in two planets and run in two planets.  What I'm loving about it is the sense of dual pressures -- of those with rank to increase it to get access to Cool Shit, and Troopers to stay where they are because there's no benefit to becoming a Corporal.  So, you get those career go-getters &amp; folks content to stay a grunt (or want to promote the easy way), and see what happens when they collide.  That's what I'm finding interesting.  The fact that you eventually could become the Brigadier (with everything that entails -- the standing orders and The Device) is awesome for all the reasons already listed.<br><br>What I'm not a big fan of, though, is how the rolls between encounters doesn't seem to do anything -- unless I'm missing something, there's no mechanical bennie or penalty for making/failing a non-encounter roll, and it makes it feel just a touch flat for me.  All the things you might want to do -- set up an ambush, first-aid someone, etc. -- are color narration things with no mechanical impacts.  I'm tempted to test a house rule in something where if you succeed on NFA roll in between encounters, you get either a +1 to your NFA roll for Dominance or +1 to your first combat round.  (Maybe with the reverse if you fail.)  I don't know if this'll result in something a bit more of what I'm looking for, but that's what testing is about.  To be clear, this isn't a slight on the game, just my sensibilities -- I like it when the narrative feeds back into the mechanics and vice versa, as that enhances the tangibility of success &amp; failure for me.<br/><br/>Unless I'm missing something, in which case please don't be coy.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165144">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165144/#Comment_165144" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T22:36:52+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 10:36PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2008 10:56PM by John_Harper.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ryan, check out page 49 under "Helping the Group Tell Stories."

Thanks for pointing that out.  There is a lot of awesome in that book, takes a bit to digest it all.  And in thinking about it, the converse is probably shitty -- life is hard enough on the group.<br/><br/>I just finished running a space station orbiting a gas planet (yes, think Bespin &amp; Cloud City) where the PCs were up against Corrupt Troopers (AA 8, Armour).  Fuck, that was rough.  (Also, being Corrupt Troopers, someone suggested that they could possible hear &amp; talk over the Trooper's comm system.  So I totally had the CT's rickroll them.)  That was fucking rough, and they could have used this.<br/><br/>That is one thing I see in something that's as complex as 3:16 -- learning more rules as you go.  When we played the first two planets, there were questions as to whether you could bother rolling FA if you would kill 0.  We said no, then learned afterwards that we could have.  I see a slightly length learning process as you see how different exceptions interact &amp; dealing with flawed interpretations (an occasional pitfall of lean text).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_165172">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165172/#Comment_165172" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T00:40:56+00:00" title="August 26, 2008 12:40AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Playing 3:16 this weekend.

Also, remember that one of the main purposes of the terran expedition is to root out from Terra the misfits that cannot live in its "perfect society" (Read the Brigadier orders). The misfits, the deranged... or simply those driven insane from living indefinitely in a world so "perfect" that there are no more stimuli. This and more (actually, I notice now how much that short text can communicate!).<br/><br/>Will all of this come up in play? Will GMs and players "get" it and play by it? Maybe, and maybe not.<br/><br/>Some will start blasting away aliens, and slowly develop a deeper understanding. Some will just enjoy acting like a silly parody of a war movie (Starship Troopers, the movie. It's completely not casual, IMO). It will certainly not "ruin" the game either way.<br/><br/>As John noted: very few groups of dogs ever think about going back to Bridal Falls and give a good shake to those elders. Does it detract from the game? I don't think so. It's just nice that there IS that added layer of depth for those that will seek it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/oliof" title="oliof"><img alt="oliof" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.mausdompteur.de/gravn32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/oliof">oliof</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165176/#Comment_165176" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T01:23:59+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  1:23AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 26, 2008 1:24AM by oliof.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, I didn't play the game yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll this fighting and killing stuff; why yes of <i>course</i> it's an illusion, says so right in the intro fiction where the whole planetary genocide thing is well put out as a pastime for the psychopathic members of a paradisical society.<br/>\n<br/>\nJohn: I don't get what's happening at Captain rank that hasn't been the game's topic on every other page before that.

In fact, I think that over time higher ranking PCs might start angling for "shore leave" and so on, while even higher ranking NPCs might be trying to frame PCs for insubordination and giving them death missions. As it says in the GM advice, I really feel that at the start of the campaign "it's about the missions" and later on "it's not about the missions" -- see page <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">3x16</span> 48.<br/><br/>For other groups, I'm sure they'll be equally happy blasting bugs relentlessly and the group might reinforce that (in their game) the fighting is entirely justified. It's a different preference.<br/><br/>In my experience the first two missions are where people first learn the rules and then tactics. From mission three onwards they start to find their characters and role-play far more. The scenes between encounters become more important to the fiction at this point, and Between Missions stuff starts to be focused on (other than just a place to get better weapons or rank).<br/><br/>Looking forward to hearing about your play, Harald. I hope it goes well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165252/#Comment_165252" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T08:54:04+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  8:54AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I think <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/?CommentID=165093" rel="nofollow">Heraldic's post</a>, above, is the best advert for the game I've seen.

I'll take that as a testament to the effectiveness of my writing.<br/><br/>I wasnt' trying to actually put anybody off of the game, but expressed my own gut reaction to the game at the time. I must admit that I was a bit tired the night that Ralph trotted it out, and I can be aa cranky as a child when in that state. I also tend to like games with a potential for happier endings. As Gregor has suggested, it may be possible to climb the ladder high enough to actually stop the madness. However, you'll have to murder a lot of aliens in order to get anyone to listen to you. Kind of like digging through a big pile of horse poo in hopes of finding the pony.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165480">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125" title="fnord3125"><img alt="fnord3125" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i200.photobucket.com/albums/aa220/fnord3125/23709_530415366954_76303075_31442083_7969789_n.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/fnord3125">fnord3125</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165480/#Comment_165480" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-26T18:08:28+00:00" title="August 26, 2008  6:08PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmmmm...
