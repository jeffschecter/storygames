As the pendulum swung one way, you would have the advantage, and so you needed to hurry before the pendulum swung back. <br/><br/>I mentioned that I had such a mechanic in Homeworld Project. At least one other person was also interested, but I'm not sure who that was, hence I'm posting this here. <br/><br/>The story goes back about six years when I was brainstorming mechanics for this <a href="http://www.rpg.net/news+reviews/columns/physics30apr03.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> at RPGnet. The problem I was trying to solve was the lack of drama in repeated rolls (whether one die or many), which ultimately stems from a statistical property called regression towards the mean. After any notable failure or success, the following rolls will tend to be more average. The simplest way to break regression towards the mean is to allow a run-away effect - winners keep on winning and losers keep on losing. But this rapidly becomes very un-fun. <br/><br/>Or as I put it six years ago:\n<blockquote>In considering various dice mechanics, it occurred to me that there is an element common in dramatic literature and movies which tends is rarely incorporated in a dice mechanic. This element is the reversal of fortunes. A swashbuckling scene doesn't have characters seemingly randomly hitting each other until one passes out or dies. Rather there is a chain of successes on the part of one combatant, or a chain of failures on the part of another. In either case there is a crescendo of drama, the successes or failures build momentum as time passes. Then suddenly they are altered, and the crescendo ceases, only to be replaced shortly with another.</blockquote>\nI hit upon an alternative, which was to force a die to behave like an inverted bell curve, where the ends become increasingly more likely and the middle becomes less and less common, as the drama level increases.<br/><br/>Take a d12. How you use it now depends on what value it shows from the last time. Taking a high drama level - translating to numbers 5 and 9 (showing in the middle of the table), the d12 "rolls" in the following way:<br/><br/>12 -&gt; re-roll<br/>11 -&gt; 12<br/>10 -&gt; 11<br/><b>9</b> -&gt; 10<br/>8 -&gt; re-roll<br/>7 -&gt; re-roll<br/>6 -&gt; re-roll<br/><b>5</b> -&gt; 4<br/>4 -&gt; 3<br/>3 -&gt; 2<br/>2 -&gt; 1<br/>1 -&gt; re-roll<br/><br/>So now, if you get a 4, you have two following actions of a decrescendo, if you get a 9 you have three following actions of a crescendo. You have bouts where characters are chasing each other, and the question of where the next roll lands is all important. You have moments where a character must vigorously defend, because he simply does not yet have the upper hand. You have moments of triumph, or moments of defeat where you must call on your friends to help you. <br/><br/>More recently Homeworld Project has taken this mechanic and has expanded on it, causing the drama numbers (here 5 and 9) to vary, starting at 2 and 11 and growing closer until they reach. This is a pacing method within the game and is used to adjust the level of dramatic tension. So far the playtesting shows it works. <br/><br/>   - Mendel S.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211485">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211485/#Comment_211485" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-10T17:13:29+00:00" title="June 10, 2009  5:13PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mendel,\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: wyrmwood</cite>So now, if you get a 4, you have two following actions of a decrescendo, if you get a 9 you have three following actions of a crescendo.</blockquote>\nJust so I'm understanding...so, for some rolled values your subsequent rolls are fixed?

High roller wins and carries the difference as an add to their next roll as a modifier due to momentum.  If the dice tie (sans mods) the momentum swings in one of three possible ways...either momentum is reset to 0, momentum is halved but now swings to the other side, or the full value of the momentum swings to the other side.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhich of the three effects you got depended on your stance.  I don't remember the specifics, but an Aggressive Stance got you certain benefits (like inflicting extra damage in fights) but if you tied after having the momentum the full momentum swung to your opponent.  Defensive Stance gave you less (like inflicting less damage in fights) but if you tied after having the momentum, momentum reset to 0 with neither side getting it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211647">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211647/#Comment_211647" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-11T11:55:03+00:00" title="June 11, 2009 11:55AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting Ralph.

We had another system where you rolled a bunch of d10s based on your "Situational Awareness" and got to act on each number (like Donjon does).  There were various things (like getting a hit, or spending time "observing") that would get you additional action dice to roll next round.  So the better you did this round, the more actions you'd get next round.  I don't think there was an explicit reversal mechanic in that one, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211885">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211885/#Comment_211885" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T07:02:08+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  7:02AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ralph, I especially like the d6 mechanic you mention, although I believe it merits some analysis. I worry that upsets happen a little too rarely to matter depending on the rest of the system. <br><br>That being said, don't sell short the advantage of knowing what your next few "rolls" are going to be. The effect of in three actions anything could happen, but till then you have a definite advantage makes for very different decisions than every action you have a 1 in 6 chance of a reversal of fortunes. <br><br>Homeworld project also has a mechanic where you can choose to progress a die showing anything but a 1 or a 12, by expending a resource. If the die result becomes a 1 the rating of that resource is reduced by one, and it becomes a 12 the rating of the resource is increased by one. So you can give up some of your victories to improve things you care about, and negate some of your failures by sacrificing some of the same. <br><br>  - Mendel S.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
