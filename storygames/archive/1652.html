                    Heya,<br/>
<br/>
This goes out to all the designers out there.  I was looking over all the responses to Vincent's RPG play history and a question came to me.  How much are your designs influenced by games you played before you published your first game?  For me, my early games were Rolemaster, ADnD and Call of Cthullu.  In my first game, Ember Twilight, they were all heavily influential.  But now, I feel like my designs are 180 degree departure from them.  What's your experience?<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

                            I often say stuff like "there are two kinds of roleplayers in the world: those who started with D&amp;D, and those who started with GURPS."  Which is reductive, sure.  Right now in this slice of history, though, the vast majority of active gamers fall into these two categories, and you can really see the differences in how they approach games.  There are also some smaller sets: the players who cut their teeth on Call of Cthulhu, those who started with Amber, the World of Darkness spawn.  Sure, they play other games, too, but I find that the <em>first</em> game you really got into has a pretty profound effect on how you see the hobby.                        </div>

                            My early experiences definitely impacted my early games (the unpublished ones). These days I'm not so sure how much of the old influeces are there; what I design seems relatively ecclectic to me. I think a lot of my influences come from other media these days - Above &amp; Beyond was inspired by the Authority, Book of Guilds was inspired by the computer game Loom, The Undying Lands came from reading Tad Williams, and so forth. Intergame bleedthrough is definitely there, but it's only one item out of many.                        </div>

Indeed! Some of us started with: (a) Classic Traveller, (b) red-book Chivalry &amp; Sorcery, and then (c) HERO system of various flavours. The first two of those were not very involved: it was HERO that formed the steel-girder foundation of my gaming education in playing pretty exclusively HERO for over ten years with my local group. In the area where I grew up, there was a concentration of HERO gamers, and your statement is probably more accurately translated "there's D&amp;D teeth-cutters, and HERO teeth-cutters". But I think the principle might still be similar (i.e. class-based, "strict-development-path" character development opposed to point-based, "design what you want" character development).<br/><br/>However, my own tinkering and designs have been more influenced by games I've read, <i>haven't</i> played, but thought, "Hey! That's a cool idea! I wish I could get that into the games I play!"<br/><br/>The most heavy influences on my own tinkerings over the years have been the Charette/Hume family of games (Daredevils, Aftermath, and Bushido), DragonQuest, and the James Bond 007 game. The only one of these I've every played, despite owning them for over twenty years, is Aftermath. But they're all well-thumbed members of my collection and have given me lots of things to think about when thinking about game mechanics...                        </div>

                            My first go was Vampire, and yeah, it has influenced me. A lot of the time by giving me a hearty fear of combat systems. On the other hand, it did give me my first taste of my favourite game topic: Moral quandries. I'm forever torturing my players with things like that.<br/><br/>On the other hand, shortly after that I was on to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay, which gave me my first taste of "Kill 'Em All!" play. Still, the game was more enjoyable for the ethical motivations of the characters.<br/><br/>I'd say its not D&amp;D vs. GURPS but rather Dungeon Hack vs The Other kinds of games. What are they called? Dunno, but you know what I mean.                        </div>

                            Shevaun, am I right in assuming you haven't played anything like GURPS or Champions, with a strong point-spend character-n-world construction set feel to it?  My D&amp;D/GURPS dichotomy is mostly about working within a system (D&amp;D; gain levels, choose options) and constructing a system as you go (GURPS; continual point-buy).  You're right in that the WoD games emphasized (at least in advice text) a continual development of personal crises; that's the large-grain structure of many of those games.  The large-grain structure of CoC is more character-as-puppet to explore a mysterious situation; the large-grain structure of Amber is a continually developing set of relationships between characters.  You see these emphases cropping up over and over again, and they are often traceable to the players first game experiences (Jason being an exception).<br/><br/>There's... quite a lot out there besides D&amp;D/not-D&amp;D. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            I would have said "Those that played D&amp;D and those that played Traveller."  GURPS came out a decade later beside Hero (in a relative sense).<br/><br/>In a survey I had my con attendees fill out I seperated gamer histories by Pre-AD&amp;D, Pre-vampire:the Msquerade, and D&amp;D 3e.  I think those time periods actually have meaning in how you approach games.  <br/><br/>I can't say that those foundation games have much influence on me (other than how not to write games).  The first few RPGs I developed were a means to emulate solid gaminess that I saw in much later games like Masterbook and DC Heroes - the numbers having concrete meaning and a logarithmic-esqe scale.<br/><br/>Some were a means to try other resolution systems for LARPs.<br/><br/>Now, the games I buy certainly influence my ideas on game design.  Scene framing, characters developed through narrative, currency and the like is a significant divergence.  I always included story/theme/premise into my mechanics and means to pull out my narrativist ways but the design has always been steeped in task resolution.  Now I far prefer conflict resolution and playing with player decision making that drive premise.  I also used to be a consumate system fiddler.  I'd hack systems to meet my tastes on a regular basis.  Now I far prefer to have systems do what I want on the outset.<br/><br/>What have I become?!!!  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Mebbe. I don't really see how the system changes the kind of game you write beyond ripping it off though (which I am guilty of), uinless you mean that GURPS style point buy games, with continual development which is entirely under the player's control, would inspire you to write/design games where characters can develop in a variety of ways, thus emphasising character over stat advancement, whilst still showing you that a system like that can be crunchy and good for combat 'n' stuff.<br/><br/>'Cause if you're saying that, then, yeah, totally. I don't even consider level-based games in game design, because I don't even think beyond the level of bit by bit, life experience-based character advancement, possibly because of my start with Vampire, and, to a lesser extent WFRP (technically Careers are like classes, but our GM was a long time player and had adapted the advancement system to allow us to get out of careers we didn't like). <br/><br/>Question: Has anyone started with GURPS-esque character advancement games and decided they would rather go with D&amp;D-esque objective-fullfillment-capacity advancement games? Or vice-versa?<br/><br/>And no, I shouldn't be allowed to try and invent terminology. I write like the German language; keep adding new words until people get the idea. Of course, I was good at German at school.                        </div>

<p>The first RPG-as-such that I played was Marvel Super Heroes (after owning and not understanding Red Box D&amp;D as an 8-year-old). We did not enjoy it. We played a fair amount of Car Wars with some RP drift as well as Renegade Legion (which I liked about 2% of) and a homebrew Battletech. Cyberpunk followed shortly thereafter and was the biggest influence on me for the longest time. That led to homebrews both by me and others (some designed on a D&amp;D basis, some on a Cyberpunk basis). Eventually, in my college years (mid-late 90s) I worked out a system called Hero Factor that was a touch like Cyberpunk, only with a "protagonometer". Eventually, I wound up doing a huge FUGE hack called "Warhamster" (after the fictional game played by the characters in Dork Tower), which I was told really looked like GURPS, which I tried using for a while until I grew tired of buying all the books and being consistently disappointed by the rules while loving the source material. I got Sex and Sorcerer to help me figure out where to take my games, got tired of a system that was entirely shoehorns, and went back to writing my own systems.</p>
<p>So... the first big design influence was Cyberpunk. Roll+skill+stat:arbitrary difficulty.</p>
<p>... and look at Under the Bed and Shock:</p>
<p>I see in Shock: a realization of what I missed in Cyberpunk combined with what I loved. Under the Bed was an experiment in a system captured in the wild. I had some stuff I wanted to do, I tried to figure out how to do it, that system's what came out.</p>
<p>So... nope. D&amp;D had little impact and the GURPS influence was deliberately abandoned. Cyberpunk's implied theme (I say "implied" because the rules don't say it) of humanity thriving like Norwegian rats in a radically crashing system influenced me a lot.</p>

                            My first game was WFRP, and I think the inherent sense of humour and darkness has shone through in my game designs, if not the rules (although I always have a soft spot for careers, lifepaths etc when I play, if not when I design). <br/><br/>My second game was Cthulhu (yes, I had a very dark upbringing when it came to roleplaying!), and that has impacted my designs even more so, with many of my designs featuring sanity or madness mechanics, and a tendency to treat the PCs as rather disposable ... at least that's the case in Dead of Night.                        </div>

                            I'm going to recast this one slightly: I think we're very much a product of the games we've played. <br/><br/>The products we've played are certainly important, and Josh's general assesment always strikes me as a valid one. (Though you could replace GURPS with HERO and D&amp;D with any of its numerous clones.) <br/><br/>However, for me the people I played with and the actual shape of our games was just as important (in good ways and bad) as the product we were playing. I know I was early and long in D&amp;D -- but I have a different focus than a lot of other D&amp;D starters that I know because of the way my early groups focused on D&amp;D. <br/><br/>But did those first years of gaming totally focus how I would see gaming for decades? Oh hell yes. There are still ways which even now, as an adult 25 years later, I'm still struggling to unlearn lessons learned in those early games.                        </div>

I almost agree with this. I think that you are not the games you've played, but the games you've played are you.<br/><br/>The games I play usually depend on player availability/interest, mechanically. The actual game and what happens in it, as Brand said, is heavily influenced by the actual people, by you.<br/><br/>The way I design is influenced by what I read, but in the end it's me taking the ideas that already fit my "Grid". I have an empty grid that as I come across new material, I compare it to the grid, and if it fits, it goes in to be used again later. I don't have a grid that gets filled with just whatever I come across, just what I find to already resonate with me.<br/><br/>I made this point, or tried to, on these two posts on my blog: <a href="http://competitiverpgs.wordpress.com/2006/06/09/winning-and-losing-tonycapes-vs-guycranium-rats" rel="nofollow">First post</a> and <a href="http://competitiverpgs.wordpress.com/2006/06/19/blindness-without-blinders" rel="nofollow">Second post</a>.                        </div>

                            My first game was a clichÃ©; <b>Auroma</b>, the "improvement" of the traditional games I had played (D&amp;D and homebrewed fantasy-system), and was very "realistic" (horrendously complicated). It was almost unplayable and never published (thank heaven).<br/><br/>Then I made a slightly different game; <b>Muu</b>, but still within the traditional setup (poetic fable, GM/players and single die).<br/><br/>Then I made a very traditional game; <b>Fabula</b>, almost simple within the traditional parametres (standard fantasy, GM/players and single die).<br/><br/>Then I foraged into some experimental design, none of it very successfu, but interesting experiements all the same.<br/><br/>Last winter I read and played a gem of a game by Magnus Jacobsson, a young Norwegian games designer. His game <i>Until we sink...</i> was a sturdy and simple design outside the traditional sphere, with no GM and very effective dramatic tools. Almost immediately I made two games inspired by his design, one a burlesque comedy on international politics: <b>No danger! Plane crashing!</b> - and the other one a lowkey social drama on death and friendship: <b>Autumn of Life</b>. Now I've decided to do a double series of games on the basis of this, a total of 18 roleplaying games inspired by this one game by Magnus.<br/><br/>So I believe in inspiration! I believe that any and every investigation of this artform benefits all, and that we give back as much as we get by striving to create new and interesting games. There is no downside to this dance of inspiration, wether you work within the framework set up by D&amp;D a long time ago, or boldy go in the more innovative directions of modern design.<br/><br/>Thank you for posting this thread! To look back is nice from time to time. It is nice to acknowledge the sources of our design, building a shared legacy.                        </div>

                            When I was introduced to rpgs, they were only sold at the non-kid-friendly hobby shop on campus.<br/>(They sold balsa wood, tiny jars of paint, shrubbery for model train terrain.  Not 'toys'.)<br/>Game stuff was often spiralbound, amateur typesetting, B&amp;W fanzine art-- in a plastic baggie.<br/>Or else a hex-map + 10,000 cardboard chits + tiny-print wargames.  As childish as a tax return.<br/>I lived in graduate student housing. I was in 5th grade.<br/><br/>A couple years later the mall toystore chain carried boxed TSR products.<br/>Art was slick color airbrushed muscles. <br/>'Blockbuster sequel' accessibility pandered to middlebrow tastes.<br/>I lived in a suburban house.  I was in 7th grade.<br/><br/>I still find myself hearing echoes of this cultural divide in the hobby.                        </div>
