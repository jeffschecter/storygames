                    I was pleased to see that there were people who were interested in playtesting the Amber rules that I brought to Camp Nerdly.  I was a little disappointed that the interest wasn't quite high enough to make it happen, but I went in knowing that was a risk, so no hard feelings on my end.<br/><br/>If you had a look at the rules I left behind, you know that they were sketchy and incomplete.  (BTW, Dave... did you pick those up?  The rules are no biggie but I like that folder)  They're getting less sketchy and less incomplete as time goes on.<br/><br/>What I'd like to do now is attempt to arrange for a one-day, eight-hour playtest of these rules.  This will probably involve a significant amount of fits and starts, and restarts, and perhaps some flashes of coolness and probably some disappointments.  <br/><br/>What I'm looking for is six to twelve interested people.  Here are the requirements:<br/><br/>1&gt; A basic familiarity with the Amber universe.  Having read "Nine Princes in Amber" (or committing to reading it before the game) is the bare minimum; the "Corwin Chronicles" (that is, books 1-5) would be better.   Any decent library will have them.<br/><br/>2&gt; Ability to travel to the Northern Virginia area.  Exact location TBD; since this event will hopefully be bigger than I can comfortably accommodate in my house I can't say where it will happen yet.  Unfortunately, due to the way these rules are set up, an online playtest isn't feasible.<br/><br/>3&gt; A willingness to try new things.<br/><br/>If you're interested in this project, please either post here or email me at vaxalon-at-gmail.com.                </div>

                            Yes, I have them for you, along with the other things you left for us - your propane stove, coffeepot, water jug, and camera case. I can drop them by your house anytime this week, just give me a call.                        </div>

                            Man, Fred, I want to play your game, but an eight-hour commitment ... and pre-scheduled on a certain day?  Is there some way that it can be chopped up into a smaller social footprint?                        </div>

                            Tony, it could be cut down, indeed; would six hours be short enough?<br/><br/>I want to make this ONE social footprint rather than two or more smaller ones, though, because there's something of a learning curve with these rules.                        </div>
