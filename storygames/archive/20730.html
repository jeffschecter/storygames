I\u2019ve been treating the game as though I were creating a TV series from the UK. Naturally, I have been seeking inspiration from existing TV series for the \u201cfeel\u201d of the program.<br/>I started researching the spy programs of the 60\u2019s first. This was the period of the big James Bond craze, so spy shows were everywhere. However, the spies in these shows are treated as though they are in law enforcement, but they bust rogue countries and super criminals. However, the feel of these shows are too happy for the horrific stuff I would like our agents to deal with.<br/>Do you know of any shows that would go well with a Spy/Urban Fantasy/Horror mashup?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455385/#Comment_455385" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-30T03:15:30+00:00" title="July 30, 2016  3:15AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2016 3:15AM by David_Berg.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All the Urban Fantasy/Horror stuff I know is pretty darn far from Spy.  But a random idea just came to mind.  Noah Bennet (aka horn-rimmed glasses guy) from <i>Heroes</i> is a sometimes-relatable, sometimes-coldblooded agent for a Company who might or might not be govt or pro-supers or anti-supers (we do find out, but I'm avoiding spoilers), who goes around inflicting his agency's will on various supernormal beings.  He has no powers, but is highly effective against those who do.  His shtick works best for people rather than pure monsters, but I think it'd fit with many versions of vampires and werewolves and the like.<br/><br/><i>Heroes</i> eventually turned into garbage, but Season 1 is mostly pretty good, and Bennet has a nice arc in it as a supporting character.  His big episode is Company Man (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0950189/?ref_=ttep_ep18" rel="nofollow">S01E17</a>) if you'd rather invest one hour than twenty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455388/#Comment_455388" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-30T04:44:11+00:00" title="July 30, 2016  4:44AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, <a href="http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/478691/index.html" rel="nofollow">The Prisoner</a> sounds perfect for this \u2014 '60s spy TV gone totally off the rails into paranoid / existentialist mindfuck territory.

Very interesting blend of horror and satire. One thing I have noticed is that I prefer his style over Lovecraft's. Part of this is because the setting and characters are so painfully and wonderfully British.

It's an interesting premise, but the adventures are fairly low budget and typical for the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455561">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455561/#Comment_455561" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-10T03:58:10+00:00" title="August 10, 2016  3:58AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not strictly spy fiction, but if you want dark or "realistic" urban superhero-type stuff, <a href="Worm" rel="nofollow">Worm</a> is amazing.

Why bother with making stuff up when there are entire modern mythologies freely shared on the internet?<br/><br/><b>James Bond</b> - The Daniel Craig version. I grew up with Sean Connery, but the Craig version is much more down to earth. Besides, you can't have "Spy" without "Bond." Even though the underlying optimistic atmosphere clashes with the dark and depressing stories of the supernatural, I can't help but feel that there needs to be something that balances out that dark world.<br/><br/><b>Harry Potter</b> - Without the whimsy. Watching the movies, the Wizarding World pulls much of its building's architecture from the previous century or two. London is a mix of new and ancient buildings, and I can imagine immortal beings preferring the older places.<br/><br/><b>Kingsman: The Secret Service</b> - Nothing to do with the supernatural, but a marvelous fusion of high-tech gadgets and British style.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455739/#Comment_455739" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T00:55:09+00:00" title="August 23, 2016 12:55AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Worm" does get into some rather tragic/grim territory (nothing ever turns out to "just go right" for the characters you're cheering for), but it's got some really unique worldbuilding, and there's always something more uplifting around the corner.<br/><br/>If you're going for more of a "spirit world"/"secret magic society" kind of deal, the same author's next work is "Pact" and deals with that in detail.<br/><br/>The thing that struck me about <i>Worm</i> is that the genius characters in it... are actually smart!

Seen most of them. Have some on DVD. The one thing I've found interesting about them is that the heroes are almost always depicted as loners. Fox Mulder may have been an FBI agent, but he was still a wild card in the agency. Torchwood in the series was also a rag-tag band of misfits. In Dr. Who, it was first introduced as an organization where everyone worked together, but it was "evil" and arrogant. It co-opted alien technology, sometimes by force, and seemed convinced they would also somehow bring back the British Empire.<br/><br/>So this is one of the major conflicts in fiction: The Individual vs The Organization. Agents work for an organization, but in fiction they are still highly individualistic and refuse to conform to someone else's expectations. John Drake could have problems with someone that was higher up in the agency. James Bond would also have problems with MI6, even something so minor as breaking one of Q's toys.<br/><br/>An interesting example is in the movie Men In Black. The tests that J was initially put through was to test how much of an Individual he and the others were. Are you willing to risk looking silly moving your chair so that you can fill out a form? Or will you conform? Are you willing to ignore the obvious targets in the shooting gallery and see what is really going on?<br/><br/>The irony of all this is that you have individuals fighting to preserve the status quo. So the people that conform don't need to be bothered with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_456052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/miedvied" title="miedvied"><img alt="miedvied" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/miedvied">miedvied</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/456052/#Comment_456052" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-09-05T13:23:11+00:00" title="September  5, 2016  1:23PM">September 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks have offered up a lot of great inspirations on the supernatural side.

Actual "good" or "bad" behaviours, however, are equally present on both sides...<br/><br/>There is no official drawback to "quitting" from the government organization (the "Protectorate"), but it exposes you to legal action from using your powers (otherwise you get some protection), and you know that you will now be up against all your former friends and/or allies.<br/><br/>Those are just the broad strokes, of course.
