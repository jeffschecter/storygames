Because I feel that this haven't been done before, and I had to write two games to learn and experiment with a different way of conveying how a roleplaying game should be played.<br/><br/>I say "roleplaying game", but I will label it as an \xbbadventurous storytelling game\xab. Mostly to avoid expectations of how a roleplaying game should look like, smell, and be played.<br/><br/>Anyway, does this structure make any sense?<br/><br/>Is there anything in there that makes you say "huh?", or scratch your head?<br/><br/>It's pages 4 and beyond that is interesting (it's like 1-2 A4 pages to read - the page size for this manual is 18\xd711.5 cm). I can say that I like how I used the table of content as an overview of how the game should be played. The table of content is useless in most books anyway, especially if there exist a decent index.<br/><br/>Don't mind the English, but focus on the context in how I explain the game.<br/><br/>I feel that, by explaining the game like this, I can reduce the number of pages to a minimum. The whole game is 3 A4 pages long (predicting about 12 pages for the size of this manual).<br/><br/><a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/doc/TIP_PreviewManual.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/doc/TIP_PreviewManual.pdf</a> (225 kb)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_441624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/441624/#Comment_441624" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-01-17T19:24:29+00:00" title="January 17, 2015  7:24PM">January 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is very nice, Rickard.

A quote from that last link:\n<blockquote>Going to Monster Mania Con and failing to sell games cut years of wishful thinking and plans doomed to failure out of my future. I'm going to tell some more details.<br/><br/>We had a sign that said "Scary Games"/.../, and it worked, it caught their interest. We had people stopping and saying "games, huh?" and "really, scary games? How scary?"<br/><br/>When we said the words "roleplaying games" to them, they visibly lost interest. On Friday we led off with "you're familiar with roleplaying games?" and it didn't matter whether they answered yes or no, as soon as we said the words we lost them. Once we just stopped saying the words, they started sticking around long enough for us to talk to them about the games.<br/><br/>The fact that the games weren't games, they were books, was the next barrier.</blockquote>\nI remember pitching the two page game <b>The Murder of Mr. Crow</b>, and as soon as I said "Write the suspects down", my non-gaming friend wrinkled his nose. Writing stuff down? That seemed too complex (in the bad way), because the game could use printed cards instead. I agree, at least when it came to that game.<br/><br/>So yeah, I'm going with pre-printed characters, three different pads of maps, summary sheets, tokens for scenes, dice and a cross-hair to mark wounds. All packaged in a box. It might cost more but I can aim to a much bigger audience. I can produce a game that <i>feels </i>like a game, and not a book. Experienced roleplaying gamers are used to books; other kinds of gamers and non-gamers ... not so much, when it comes to games anyway.<br/><br/>And then we got the target audience.

I found cheap tokens at www.spielmaterial.de and printing boxes are cheap here in Sweden. For printing the manual, I will probably turn to an Estonian printing house, as a game designer acquaintance printed his 300+ pages book there for $3-4. What's killing me is the shipping. Just to send something within the borders cost between $5-10 and sending something abroad is 3-4 times as expensive. It would be cheaper for me to pack everything in a rental van and drive down to Poland to send it.<br/><br/>Hopefully, I can turn to a roleplaying game distributor for cheap shipping, and I'm sure they know who I am.<br/><br/>I will <a href="http://stonemaiergames.com/how-to-provide-free-shipping-worldwide-on-kickstarter-a-comprehensive-guide/" rel="nofollow">look up Amazon</a> more closely too.<br/><br/>The thing is, this is not the funny part for me. My game was "finished" (but not written down) a year ago, but the logistics made this project come to a halt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_445927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445927/#Comment_445927" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-03T14:09:46+00:00" title="July  3, 2015  2:09PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 3, 2015 6:09PM by Rickard.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm finally starting to write the rest of the manual now.

One of my design goals were that I wanted the game to be able to be played while reading it, but I had to abandon that thought. I'm presenting a process consisting of two loops - and this is not how roleplaying games normally are written. Edward de Bono says about processes, and something I learned by making <a href="http://www.urverkspel.com/vara-spel/oevriga-projekt" rel="nofollow">Imagine and The Murder of Mr. Crow</a>, that one must need to start at the end and paint the big picture. I can then narrow it down as I go towards the beginning. I need to do that to make the reader understand the whole process, which is hard - I would say, even impossible - to do if I wrote how to play the game in chronological order.<br/><br/>I got two constant loops in the game, which follows the pattern for engagement. The two loops are 1) playing through acts and 2) the interaction between the participants. So far, I got to briefly describe the first loop. In two days (on Sunday), this document below will describe the second loop too.<br/><br/><a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/doc/TIP_PreviewManual.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/doc/TIP_PreviewManual.pdf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445929/#Comment_445929" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-03T16:21:30+00:00" title="July  3, 2015  4:21PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm looking forward to reading this Rickard, as I've had some similar problems to what you've just described myself.

It's the PLAY that is important in a game. It's PLAY that a game should be designed for, and every element should point towards it.<br/><br/>Typical roleplaying games present the existing roles, like warrior, rouge, or presenting a guild by how many members it has and where it's located. That's not important for the interaction. What I focus on is how to talk to each other, and we do that by taking turns; the same turns that shares the same sequence, only affected by if we are a warrior, a rouge, or if we act in the interest of a guild. Or in the case of this game: what kind of moves we got.<br/><br/>For anyone who follows me on G+, they know that I have just written a series about <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/8VdGU" rel="nofollow">my thoughts on interaction</a> and how it should be conveyed in roleplaying games. I had a huge problem writing This is Pulp, as mentioned in the previous post, because I wanted to write in chronological order. Those articles helped me a lot to take a step back and see what I did wrong, how my <i>thinking</i> was wrong in how I should present the information, and now I'm having no trouble filling my headlines with words. Because I can see, in a clear way, how I should write it.<br/><br/>Same link as before, this time it's about the interaction between the participants: <br/><br/><a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/doc/TIP_PreviewManual.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/doc/TIP_PreviewManual.pdf</a><br/><br/>I suppose the manual will be finished in five days - that's five more headlines to write. So by the end of the week, I will have a manual ready for external playtest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_445991">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli" title="davidepignedoli"><img alt="davidepignedoli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/davidepignedoli">davidepignedoli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/445991/#Comment_445991" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-06T13:34:13+00:00" title="July  6, 2015  1:34PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            just to say I'm liking this a lot                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
