In this case they need more encouragement than hand holding.<br/><br/>Or it may be because they like your company name, and game lines, and want to work for you. After all many more people are writers than they are writer / designer / creator / owners, and they just want to do something and be paid, rather than engage in a massive, creative effort.

I designed games, I liked the idea of having a game played by other people, but the thought of self-publishing never occurred to me. I thought it was an expensive sort of thing (as it was until pretty recently), something for companies and not individuals. It took Gregor to persuade me that this was not the case, and even there I needed his help to get into print. I won't really be a proper self-publisher until Eekamouse in Atlantis comes out, because of BoxNinja's role in getting Solipsist into print.<br/><br/>If I'd approached a company with an idea for printing Solipsist at that time, I'd really have liked to get the sort of encouragement I got from Gregor (without the actual commitment level of course), to let me know how I might go about doing things myself                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177245/#Comment_177245" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T03:07:28+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  3:07AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, of course people should get adviced. It's just probably better to make the advice personal in nature. There are so many different sorts of people and goals in publishing. Simply the question of whether a guy cares more about designing a good product or selling a lot of stuff explodes the array of discussion into so many directions than advice directed at one is not very relevant for the other.<br/><br/>I guess my advice for the unpublished designer is to go to the Forge and engage people into dialogue about their plans.

If you can design them out, you probably should.<br/>* Consider the utility of your form factor, both in terms of offering it in other mediums (Lulu doesn't do half-letter/digest, for example) and practical issues (an exotic format means retailers and gamers have trouble shelving your game).<br/>* Consider the implications of book pricing, particularly if you want to offer it through retailers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177265">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177265/#Comment_177265" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T07:21:15+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  7:21AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Build or find a market for your product before spending any money on it.<br/><br/>Test your product with a small percentage of that market before releasing the product on a larger scale.<br/><br/>Be patient.

If you find you enjoy game design and self-publishing, you can use your first game as a foundation to launch the second one.

A game text.<br/>2. Somebody to do layout, turning it into a PDF (this can also be you).<br/>3. A place to sell the PDF online, like a Paypal button or RPGnow.<br/>4. You might also consider a simple print+distribution service like Lulu (which also distributes PDFs), if you're invested in having a print version available.<br/><br/>There are other optional things you might need in order to achieve your own standard of "success":<br/><br/>- a marketing plan<br/>- a website with more info about your game, a message board, a mailing list, etc.<br/>- a cheaper printer (Lulu is not cost-effective for making real profit)<br/>- an independent distribution service like IPR or Key20 or one the new thingees that are starting up<br/>- a booth to sell your game at conventions<br/>- etc.<br/><br/>A good place to ask questions and find out more information about publishing is The Forge's publishing forum.  If you're more interested in talking informally about your game, try Story Games.  Also try to get in touch with other independent publishers in your region.  We are everywhere.

They integrate into PayPal without you having to do any more than sign up for a PayPal account and provide them with the email address you used, and <br/>2. If you are selling in low volume there is no charge whatsoever. No upfront charge, no monthly charge, no per-item charge. By the time you are selling enough for them to charge you, you can afford it. <br/><br/>So it's easy and there's no financial risk whatsoever. You can do the whole thing on literally zero budget - use free tools to lay out and PDF your file, promote it using a free WordPress or Blogger blog - and if nobody buys your stuff you're only out some time. You haven't spent even one cent on the project.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177305/#Comment_177305" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-04T13:46:22+00:00" title="November  4, 2008  1:46PM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't invest huge amounts.

The online tools available these days mean you can distribute stuff widely for very little expense.<br/><br/>The trouble with making it easy to publish is that lots of people do. Some of those people have no business writing, editing, doing layout, etc. So please be very honest with yourself about where your own talents and limitations lie. And don't treat this as a throwaway thing where quality doesn't matter. To create something good takesa  bit of time and effort. And craft - like any skill or set of skills, the way you get good at it is to practice. When you look back on your early attempts you'll see them full of holes, but that's just part of the process.<br/><br/>RPGnow/DriveThru still, as far as I know, accept anybody as a new publisher on payment of the $40. But there are, what, 400-500 publishers on there and I'd guess only about 20% of those (or fewer?) get any significant profit or name recognition.<br/><br/><br/>Tim Gray<br/>Silver Branch Games                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_177563">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177563/#Comment_177563" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T09:33:54+00:00" title="November  6, 2008  9:33AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Simon,<br/>\n  I did a round of that a while ago (2005 maybe?). Sending out e-mails to publishers that "looked" like they were willing/able to publish for me.<br/>\n  This was born from a couple of issues:<br/>\n1) I didn't know how to get printed ( I didn't even learn about lulu from a gamer, it was a novel writer who turned me on to lulu)<br/>\n2) I didn't know how to get art (still don't - I've read some stuff on the Forge, but I don't know how to do it without spending a lot of money)<br/>\n3) I didn't know how to market my game (still don't - I have read some stuff and tried doing what it said, but it is not working for me...)<br/>\n4) I didn't have any money (still don't)<br/>\n5) I don't really go to game conventions (I could, but usually don't - I'd like to, but the few times I have gone I didn't have a super amount of fun, but maybe I didn't know what to do or where to look for the fun)<br/>\n6) I didn't know about any forums or other sources of help (I hadn't even heard of the Forge at that point, even now there seems like there are lots of resources out there that I am unaware of)<br/>\n7) I didn't know how to get my game in stores<br/>\n8) I didn't know how to get my game published through other venues (on-line/download/etc.)<br/>\n  The reality was, most of my e-mails went into black holes. It was a dark time. Eventually I found the forge, but people seemed to be really mad at me (I still don't knwo why it seemed so hostile, they are nicer now). And I was introduced to the term fantasy heartbreaker. Which has been an albotros around my neck ever since. No one will even look at my game because its easy to dismiss it as a fantasy hearbreaker, so there's that...<br/>\n  So, any help, advice, anything, even if its pre-canned, would be great!<br/>\nDave M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_177568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray" title="Tim_Gray"><img alt="Tim_Gray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tim_Gray">Tim_Gray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/177568/#Comment_177568" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-11-06T10:04:00+00:00" title="November  6, 2008 10:04AM">November 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            DlnDenver: there is good clipart around on sites like Your Games Now and RPGnow, as collections and individual pieces.
