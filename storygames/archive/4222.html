We are building it bigger. We are widening the corridors and adding more lanes.</i><br/><br/>Here's the skinny:  I'm part of an organization whose main goal is to have a gaming convention in Tucson, Arizona.  <br/><br/>We're shooting for a weekend convention next fall. Friday afternoon through Sunday afternoon. While Tucson has a science fiction convention with a (small) gaming room, the convention we're creating is focused on gaming: board games, role-playing games, miniatures, and CCGs.  I'm under the Gaming Chair as the head of the RPG track and my secret agenda is to get that love going for our con that I see in so many reports about Dreamation.  I would love to make this new con into <i>the</i> Southwestern con to go to for new, indie RPGs.  <br/><br/>But I'd really want it so our convention is a fun event that our guests -- and that's the word I'm using for attendees -- will want to come back to.  So here's a few questions for you:<br/><br/>What types of things make a gaming con great for you?  What can con organizers do that makes you think these guys have their act together?  What types of things make a convention a easy, fun experience for you?  (And this is everything associated with a convention experience: online registration, game slot length, the location of vendor booths to game play areas...  Pretty much any aspect of a con you can think of.)  <br/><br/>What makes you want to come back to next year's convention?<br/><br/>On those lines, do you have any horror stories about things that went wrong at a convention that, with hindsight, could have been easily rectified if the convention organizers did one or two different things?  Any anecdotes you can share can go a long way in making this convention into a great convention.<br/><br/>Thanks much in advance.  (And I hope to see you down in Arizona next fall!)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_94575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Merten" title="Merten"><img alt="Merten" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://merten.kapsi.fi/pics/fiat.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Merten">Merten</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94575/#Comment_94575" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T00:29:29+00:00" title="September 11, 2007 12:29AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thomas D</cite>What types of things make a gaming con great for you?

Pretty much any aspect of a con you can think of.)<br/><br/>What makes you want to come back to next year's convention?</blockquote>\nNot familiar with Dreamation, just our local convention, but some things that come to mind:<br/><br/>Variety. A convention should have a wide variety of things to do and experience, preferably also stuff you don't know much about. Tabletop roleplaying games, live-action games, miniature games, board games, a good deal of speech programs, panels and workshops. I'd especially emphasize things that don't directly involve playing, but socializing and learning. Playing games is a good thing, but it's even better if it exists as an well-served option, not as a demand.<br/><br/>Some cool stuff that exists right outside gaming is good. Add something that's not directly relevant to gaming, but is cool. What's cool probably depends on the demographic of the attendees you're expecting to arrive. If you're expecting folks that have families and want to come with them, arrange something cool for the kids.<br/><br/>The convention should be in a place it's easy to get to, with enough facilities to accomondate those coming in from a far; a hotel nearby but perhaps also some other kind of accomondation, like Bring Your Own Sleeping bag or such. The price of staying shouldn't become a barrier if travelling costs money. If you're doing pre-registration, make it worthwile (slightly cheaper prices or something), but it should also be easy just to get a ticket from the door and arrive on whim.<br/><br/>There should be a good internal communication between the organisers; a centralized information hub for the convention goers, that can reach every different part of the convention and people running it, is a must. A good knowledge of the local area helps a lot, too - providing and finding out answers for pretty much everything and not just things happening inside the convention area is good service.<br/><br/>Try to do cross-genre stuff. Mix boardgame intrests with roleplaying, like having a panel about game design with both rpg and board game designers/players. Have programme that caters a wider audience that just a typical GM tips -panel (though do have some of that specialized stuff as well).<br/><br/>Have a bar nearby.<br/><br/>Invite Guest of Honours. Take care of them and provide them with a convention experience in which they only have to worry about doing Guest of Honour stuff (they'll be able to do more of it, if you're taking care of the other stuff like arranging lunch for them). GoH's tend to be professional speakers, which is a good thing in terms of programme. Giving a Guest of Honour a good experience is a good way of getting indirect marketing for your convention, since word gets around, both to other potential GoH's and guests at large. Same goes for pretty much everyone; getting that friendly, laidback-but-professional attitude, in place is the best marketing you can have.<br/><br/>Add something extra, like good looking convention t-shirts for sale.<br/><br/>As for things to avoid:<br/><br/>Overstressed, overworked and grumpy staff is a bad thing to have. Avoid by ensuring that you have enough voluntary workforce staffing the convention and making sure that no one takes too much responsibility to his plate.<br/><br/>Try to keep schedhules; when things fail, work on communication. If a program item gets cancelled, make sure that info about it is easily available.<br/><br/>Make sure the official paperwork (permits, what ever) gets done well in advance. Check and double-check. It's a tad bit stressing if you don't know that you're permitted to run an event that's starting in few days.<br/><br/>Always leave some margin for error, especially with scedhules (but budget as well). Especially the airports will try to screw you with delays and stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_94594">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/94594/#Comment_94594" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-11T04:50:56+00:00" title="September 11, 2007  4:50AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you doing this to make money?

Running a convention is a logistical operation. We recently had to make some staff changes because some people who were great game masters were lousy event organizers.<br/><br/>Other than that, keep an open mind, and actively solicit input from your guests. As long you demonstrate basic competence and continuing improvement, they'll continue to give you the benefit of the doubt.
