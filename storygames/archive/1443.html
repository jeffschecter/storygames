<p>I'd love to make a game design about my whacky personal Ideology X. For the sake of example, let's say that my X is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_theory_of_value" rel="nofollow">Labor Theory of Value</a>. (It's not, but go with it.)</p>
<p>I don't want a game where we talk about how awesome a world with LTV would be, or a fantasy where we <em>fight the man</em> and bring LTV to the world, or a game that's a sunday school parable on the virtues of LTV (and the sins of anti-LTV). That all sounds remarkably tedious towards to pro-LTV players, and maybe even insulting to anti-LTV people.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, suppose I still want to socially engineer an outcome by which those who play are either (a) more secure in their proto-LTV beliefs, or (b) more understanding or aware of others' LTV stances, even if they are very certainly not holding that belief.</p>
<p>So. Can this be done? Are there examples?</p>

                            Well, RaHoWa sets out to do this, I suppose, but it's not exactly the cutting edge of game design.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I were to make a game to spread the LTV, I'd probably make it a competetive board game. Each player would take on the role of one group of workers and one group of capitalists and they'd try to maximize their amount of money by hiring each other out to form temporary firms. Each firm would get some production function based on the amount of labor and capital put into it. Labor would be measured by little chits and capital would only emerge from this process - the first firms would be all-labor - and be reprsented by, say, some clear plastic container holding chits, because capital is ultimately just stored labor. And I'd let everything emerge from that. We could even have a pool of cards representing various market niches that slowly got used up, along with a bonus for monopoly position, to represent the falling rate of profit. And such forth.<br/>
<br/>
But it really depends on what X <i>is</i>. I mean, the LTV is all math-y and stuff, so a Monopolyesque board game makes sense for it. Other ideological positions better warrant an actual RPG, because they're more personal - sexual politics, for instance. So it's really impossible to say "here is a formula for producing a game around X" because building a game around X is going to by definition be a function of what X <i>is</i>.                        </div>

                            It is possible because I've done something along those lines.<br><br>I ran a LARP at work because I wanted to demonstrate a particular point and I called it a strategy game for policy staff. I work as an analyst in central government in the UK and I did a talk about strategy and then  set up the game with policy people playing three groups of participants, Policy, Analysts and Delivery. <br><br>The aim of the game was for the in-game policy people to create a new strategy to deal with a particular problem and have this policy delivered. This would have been fine had I not had been feeding bad news to each group at regular intervals to interfere with their smooth running - much like what happens in reality.<br/><br/>The upshot of the game was that there was a big bottleneck on analysis as policy and delivery people kept changing their analytical requests at short notice without defining them terribly well. At one point one of the policy people who was playing an analyst told another group to "piss off!"<br/><br/>This demonstrated the value of a proper long-term analytical programme to support both policy and delivery.<br/><br/>I think if you follow the schema that Daniel outlines you should be able to create something that delivers what you want. I think also if you have lots of things happening quite quickly and people don't have enough time to think about alternatives (such as hiring consultants in my game) that these pressures are more likely to make people go the way you want them to.                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            I think a lot of games have a political component (maybe all, but I won't go that far just yet).  And I certainly think what the OP is describing is possible.  Players can buy into the politics of a setting without coming to believe them out of character, so I can certainly envision such a game for a particular political theory.<br/>
<br/>
The most overtly politically-informed game I ever ran was (and is) an Adventure! Gotham City supers game. Gotham City is a politically conservative dark fantasy. The government is corrupt, criminals go unpunished, only through the special training of a small group of people willing to break "unimportant" laws to enforce the "important" ones can civilization survive and not fall into anarchy and chaos. (Hell, the iconic character is a wealthy white heir to a massive fortune, that should tip you off right there.)  This is approximately as far from my actual political beliefs as can be imagined, and most of my gaming friends are left-of-center as well (my wife the exception - but even she recognizes that the fantasy is based on very extreme assumptions.) Yet we are able to get into the point of view of the hardline "dangle them off a building and maybe even drop them a few times to get them to talk" characters and setting by celebrating the source material and by me making it seem like everything is at stake with every decision (not true.)<br/>
<br/>
There are highly conservative roots in a lot of game setups.  "We few see the world for how it really is and we must take action ourselves using the abilities that put us above the mass of men, to protect them, the power we gain is merely a side effect of the protection we give."                        </div>

I tend to find that questioning my beliefs actually makes me stronger in them because then I've thought about what my beliefs actually are, and whether I believe in them because it's something I actually believe or merely something I was taught.  Thinking about them and questioning them means I can answer the question "why do you believe that?" with something more than "I just do" or "that's what I've always believed".  So, as long as a game questions beliefs but doesn't cross over into beating them into the ground and making them seem hopeless, I think it's a good thing.<br/><br/>--Nancy                        </div>

If I can rephase Ben, I think there are primary two ways to go about this---you can make the agenda/ideal/whatever the central issue of play (ala Dogs) where players explore the consequences, morality, plus/minuses of the issue; or you can make game didactic in nature, where the game mechanics express your outlook on the subject.<br/><br/>The former method might be a little more obvious, but the didactic method is completely doable I think. You can argue that the Trust mechanics in <i>The Mountain Witch</i> are primarily didactic. The structure of the rules certainly express a certain outlook. But maybe tMW isn't the best example, as it's kinda a mix of the two methods.                        </div>

<p>I'm reminded that, for a healthy enough belief, it can only be made stronger (or more understandable at least) by rendering it critically. (If it's the kind of belief that shudders and dies under any kind of criticism, well, that's your own fault!)</p>
<p>On the other hand, even getting to that point (where you're giving the subject a critical look) means you're loading up on assumptions aplenty, which risks a premature rejection. I've seen this with some people who cannot get into a game of Dogs in the Vineyard. I've played with plenty of progressive-ish people, but some folks simply cannot accept the following as a given: "Pretend that God has given you the unadulterated authority to decide what is and isn't right." I think for many people, simply holding that speculative assumption is giving up too much, and I think that could be a problem with ideology.</p>
<p>Tim, I think the trick is that you can strictly proscribe how something in the world works (in this case, trust) so long as the meaty core focus of the game is elsewhere. Trust <em>effects</em> the focus of tMW, but it's not the core focus. In contrast, You could say MLwM is a game about redemption, and it has rather mechanistic rules about how redemption "works", so it's much more likely that a player could get tripped up there and lose investment in the game.</p>

For some progressives (probably not the ones you are talking about) this would be a perfect illustration of self-blindness. But anyway...<br/><br/>Seems like there are at least two ways you can approach this. The "education" approach is "Let's see what the world looks like from inside this ideology. Hmmm, interesting." The "propaganda" approach is "Let's see why this ideology makes complete sense of the world. Behold, truth!" I'm guessing that you're after the first one, which frankly we need more of in a world where differing ideologies are in contact all the time. If you can make it fly I'll be very interested to see the result.                        </div>

                            I've been told by several Marxists that my designs for <i>Merchant</i> (running a fantasy merchant house, basically) was quintessentially Marxist. I've finally read <i>Das Kapital</i> all the way through, and you'd think that I'd based it on Marx's work, which of course I hadn't.<br/><br/>I think the point I'm trying to make is that game mechanics are distillations of the way the world works - very basic and abstract simulations and models.  This is exactly what the raw stuff of the sociological sciences is - distilling the way the world works according to some paradigm of thought.  So it's really no wonder that you can either accidentally stumble across, or purposely create, an ideological model of society in designing a game.  You're simply doing what a sociologist or anthropologist is doing, only in a top-down fashion.<br/><br/>A social scientist observes behavior and asks "What are the principles and rules behind human interaction."<br/><br/>The game designer says (or asks himself, then says) "<i>These</i> are the principles and rules behind human interaction."  And the play of the game exhibits behaviors based on those rules.<br/><br/>If your game has a mechanics for "Might = Right", you're exhibiting a model of social behavior.  Whether you intend to do it or not.                        </div>

<p>I came up with a different use for ideologically-slanted games: preaching to the choir. Let me explain... Preaching to the choir doesn't create new believers, by definition. It can, in the best case scenario, re-activate those who do believe but have scarred over with cynicism. A storygame experience could also resonate in the same way with people associated by political belief.</p>

                            Hey, Dev.<br/><br/>I think JD's got the clearest description of this in <em>play</em>; however, you're asking about this in terms of <em>design</em>.  I don't think whoever was writing Marvel Heroes or whatever JD's group is using was intentionally trying to create this dark-conservative world (although JD, in his setting up of the campaign, may have).  In other words, I think that a political agenda will emerge in play; it's just a question of how much of it was intended by the designer.<br/><br/>I mean, look at default D&amp;D: you must subsume your individuality to become a functional member of a team which itself constitutes an elite caste of the only people who can solve the problems in the world that others ignore and avoid.  In my humble and totally biased opinion, the ideology that grows up out of this very foundational game is the only reason that gaming in general didn't become dominated by rabidly liberal wonks like me.  There's a profound appeal there for my noble opposition that says, "The system does not and never can work, and only enlightened people like me can fix the world, oh, and don't be different cause that messes things up."<br/><br/>Contrast this with, say, <em>Blue Rose</em>, where (assuming you play Knights of the Rose) you <em>are</em> the system, and you are the only thing that will make the world work correctly.  For that matter, <em>Dogs</em> works on a similar ideological chassis in a non-eurofantasy world.<br/><br/><em>Agora</em> sort of works this way, in answer to your question, but while my intention in designing it was towards these ends I'm presently of the opinion that the game doesn't have quite enough bite to it.  After I get <em>FLFS</em> out the door, I'll be taking a sledge to the game and seeing if I can reconstitute it to more accurately hit "How shall we live?" rather than "What will you risk to force people to live like you want?"<br/><br/>On the other hand, if I can point at <em>FLFS</em> for a moment, this game will come out with a political ideology in play, but from what I've seen that ideology is different table to table and group to group, depending on the characters involved.  Imperialism and rank will always be an element of that ideology, but whether you come out "pro" or "con" on those themes depends on if your character has <em>Gentlemen</em> and <em>Military Tradition</em> as their thematic batteries or <em>Rebel</em> and <em>Loose Cannon</em>.  So again, ideology will be there, but as a designer I can either retain authority over it or hand it over to the players.                        </div>

If you're talking about games with a definite political slant, there's always September 12, a web game from Water Cooler Games.  In it, people are walking around a fairly crowded Arabic-looking town.  There are terrorists among them, and you blow up the terrorists with a rather crude cruise-missile.  Kill any innocents, and you get mourners, who then turn into more terrorists.<br/><br/>It's an explicit political message turned into a game.  I doubt it'll win any converts, that's for sure.                        </div>

                            Well, someone had to do the design, and if the writers of Adventure! didn't (they didn't), then I did when I selected the source material and concocted the situations and the players did when they "bought in". I don't really buy into the division between game designer and player that much - it comes from years of being a GM merrily doing my own thing and not giving two good shits what a game designer might have intended, or, in many cases, actually written.                        </div>

                            Oh! Well, yes. I think I definitely am aware of the political assumptions of the genre, and the same is true of cyberpunk games I have run ("look where your LOLbertarianism gets us!!") and as you clearly elucidate in your (JBR's) post, how D&amp;D rewards conservative thinking. The players are sometimes aware of this (certainly they are in the Gotham City game,typically not so much in D&amp;D - mainly because they don't read Westerns and certainly have never read any politically deconstructive Westerns.) <br/>
<br/>
Is just being aware of political assumptions the same thing as political commentary? I don't really know...like I say, I don't believe the political statements underlying my Gotham City game...yet I certainly am not deconstructing or criticizing them...so I suppose if it is a political commentary, I am lying.<br/>

It depends how much those are at the forefront of everyone's mind, I suppose. I mean, Exalted is arguably D&amp;D with the subtext made explicit, but not every Exalted game is a critique or celebration of the use of political force by the few upon the many. It's just going to be easier to play it that way than not, whereas to show the critique in D&amp;D you will have to make a more specific effort.<br/><br/>Or rather, D&amp;D will be a celebratory critique if you don't pay attention to the issue, whereas Exalted will make you pay attention to the issue and thereby be more conscious of what choose you make on it. That would seem to apply abstracting from those particular games, I think.                        </div>

                            Personally, I love how Zhang Yimou's <i>Hero</i> (and, more recently, Ronny Yu's <i>Fearless</i>) subverted some traditional tropes of their respective genres (wuxia &amp; revenge) to make contemporary political statements. Could you run an <i>Exalted</i> game that felt like <i>Hero</i>, where the needs of the many (represented by an authoritarian state) outweighed the passions of the few (represented by an elite band of intellectual heroes)? Could you run one that felt like <i>Fearless</i>, where dying at the hands of one's enemies (and not seeking revenge) is a show of strength and the path to victory (sort of an extreme form of civil disobediance)? Could you make a character that is Jet-Li-as-sacrificial-hero?                        </div>

                            Jonathan, I think that's an interesting question.  Because, speaking as a potential player, I don't really want to end up sacrificing my character because the game is built to lead him (or her) up to that moment of sacrifice.  I want to sacrifice my character because <i>I personally</i> think it's a cool and/or interesting thing to do in the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Which means that, in my opinion, if there is going to be thematic design at work then it has to create tense or interesting situations but it has to not just specify a single path for getting out of them.<br/>
<br/>
I think D&amp;D is a fairly "straitjacketed" game if run with a set of by-the-book assumptions.  What you're <i>really</i> meant to do in almost all situations in D&amp;D is to fight.  That's why the preponderence of rules text, Feats, Spells, etc are all focussed on combat.  (I'm not denying that D&amp;D supports a lot broader play than this, just saying that that's where its focus lies.)<br/>
<br/>
But I couldn't imagine playing a game where the predominant way to solve conflicts was by heroic self sacrifice.  (No duh.)  I suppose what an interesting design could do would be to work to <i>prohibit</i> certain choices and then see what interesting alternatives players come up with.  So I could imagine a kind of anti-D&amp;D where physical conflict was absolutely the worst thing you could do.  And then you could use that game to have all kinds of ornery conflicts where people can't really choose to fight and you have to see what other options they avail themselves of.<br/>
<br/>
The challenge, in my eyes, is in providing enough freedom to let the players actually come up with meaningful options to resolve these conflicts, while providing enough structure to resolve them and to make the different choices actually feel like ... well, like distinct choices really.                        </div>

<b>Robert:</b> In the D&amp;D model, choosing non-violence sucks because it gets you dead. I could easily see creating a game where choosing violence ends up getting other people killed.  You could still choose it, and it would be a powerful moment when you did, but there are systematic reasons not too.  Or maybe the system would still encourage you to be violent, but only so you could see the consequences of such actions. One of the core principles of the <i>Exalted</i> hack I'm working on is that use of supernatural power has personal consequences, very much modeled on the idea of hubris. This is certainly a moral statement, if not an explicitly political one (though moral statements obviously have political implications).                        </div>

That's one possible solution in <em>Tribe 8</em>.  Blood and sacrifice!                        </div>

                            Just found this article on <a href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2006/07/saving_the_worl.html" rel="nofollow">Serious Games</a> over at Clive Thompson's blog. He mentions September 12 among a number of other more sophisticated video games dealing with current issues. Quote:
<blockquote>Video games, serious-games advocates say, also possess a persuasive element that is missing from books or movies: They let the player become a different person (at least for an hour or two), and see the world from a new perspective. When Mr. Burak first showed Peacemaker [which is about the Palestinian/Israeli conflict] to Israelis and Palestinians, he found that they were most interested in playing as their own "side." But when he pushed them to switch positions they developed a more nuanced sense of why the other side acted as it did. In Qatar several people told him that "they kind of understood more the pressures the Israeli prime minister has."</blockquote>
There's apparently money in it, too - people are funding the creation of these games. Be in, people!<br><br>EDIT FOR CAVEAT:<br><br><a href="http://xkcd.com/c106.html" rel="nofollow"><img alt="image" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wright_brothers.png"/></a> </br></br></br></br></div>
