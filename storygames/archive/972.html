                    Okay, so in my Heroquest games there are these people who have surrendered their identities to "The Mystery".  They're kind of like Men in Black; they're anonymous, and magically forgettable.  Anyone who interacts with them has trouble remembering the interaction, except for others of their kind.<br/>
<br/>
Originally, I had thought of a mechanic for handling the case of a Mysterious NPC meeting a non-Mysterious PC.  At the BEGINNING of the encounter, we'd roll the contest to see how much the PC remembered, and play out the scene at the level of detail that the result implied.  For example, in a minor defeat:<br/>
<br/>
"He asked some questions about people you knew.  You don't remember exactly who, though.  Did you give him a hard time?"<br/>
"No, I was too shaken.  I told him everything."  (This may be the result of another contest)<br/>
"Okay.  After that, he gave you some instructions, but you don't remember those, either.  Then he left."<br/>
<br/>
After having worked this out, at this point it strikes me that this is a very actor-stance way of going about the interaction.  It puts the player firmly into the point of view of the character directly after the encounter, wondering what happened and trying to fit the pieces together.  An author-stance way of going about it would let the player in on the whole conversation, and then roll for the memory magic at the end of the conversation, and let the player play his character's ignorance at a remove.<br/>
<br/>
So I think for this kind of situation I'm going to give the player a choice of how to proceed, depending on whether he wants to know what his character missed, or not.                </div>

                            I don't know if that's inherently actor-stance.  If I were a player, I'd totally say something like "And he told me who in our group is secretly one of the Mysterious, but I don't remember that bit either."                        </div>

                            To clarify... you're saying that if you were the player in that situation, in actor stance, you would say that in the character's voice?                        </div>

I'm saying that I think this same "We roll to see how much you don't know about the encounter" rule is independent of whether people use Actor, Author or Director stance.  That was an example of me (for instance) using some Director stance into the vagued-up areas of the unknown conversation.                        </div>

                            I deliberately left director stance out of the situation because it can, indeed, be used in either of the two sets of mechanics.<br/>
<br/>
The first mechanic is aimed at preserving the more character-focused play, allowing the player to know only what the character knows.<br/>
<br/>
The second mechanic is aimed at sacrificing that ignorance, to allow more story-oriented play, that is, to let the player in on some secrets his character doesn't know.<br/>
<br/>
You may be right; this may be orthogonal to stance concerns.  I had always thought of actor stance as primarily character-focused, and author stance as more story-focused.  I could be wrong about that.<br/>
<br/>
It occurs to me that there's a third option, which is to roll the contest up front, play the conversation explicitly, and then summarize at the appropriate level of vagueness afterwards, but it doesn't strike me as being TOO much different than the second option.<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that Heroquest is very traditional about director stance.  Any player input that isn't character-focused has to be approved by the GM.                        </div>

                            See, I always thought of Actor and Author as more motivational:  In Actor you do something because your character would do it (which, yeah, has <i>something</i> to do with what the character knows, but not everything) and in Author you do something because it's cool and then you figure out a reason for the character to do it.<br/>
<br/>
So, Author-mode/Ignorant:  "My guy should totally try to take Mr. Mystery down, but get trounced.  He remembers that he got trounced, but not how the guy did it.  That way he'll have that hovering aura of defeatism whenever we deal with these guys in future."                        </div>

                            Hm, I don't see that statement about stances as disagreement.  In Actor stance, you do something because it's what the character demands.  In Author stance, you do something because it's what the (cool, good, etc.) story demands.<br/>
<br/>
Your example is slightly flawed but it's still fairly persuasive.  (The player doesn't have clear authority to state how the fight comes out.)<br/>
<br/>
Would you say, then, that the "keep it vague" mechanic would NOT necessarily get in the way of author stance?                        </div>

                            Tony and Shreyas are right---The difference between actor/author stance is about the motivation behind the decision. "Story" vs "Character" is totally besides the point. Gamist play very commonly uses author/pawn stance in the pursuit of good tactics. It's also very common to for Narrativists to play in total "character" mode, they just make characters that have lots of story potential (and thus never have to "break character" to produce interesting stories).                        </div>

Does the first mechanic, keeping the interaction vague when the PC loses the contest, get in the way of author stance?                        </div>
