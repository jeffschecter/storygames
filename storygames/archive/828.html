                    Hey all, need help putting together something for a one-shot PTA game that turned into a Season.<br/><br/>So, the PCs are time travellers from different eras that work for a kind of "time cop" agency (minus the Jean Claude Van Damme) that spans several time periods.  They investigate and correct problems with the time stream when others from the future go back in time to screw things up.<br/><br/>Everything pseudo-science-y has been accounted for with handwaves and the like. However, there's one point that came up that kinda needs to be explained with a little deeper level of pseudo-science and hand-waviness.<br/><br/>I need to come up with a reason for why, if the players fail in their mission, they couldn't just go back to the same time period to try again. <br/><br/>I don't want it to be impossible for people to travel again and again to the same period, becuase that sort of thing would be cool for a special episode.<br/><br/>Also, I don't want it to be a lame explanation, like, "Because if you travel again to the same era, people might see you at the same time, and that would cause suspicion, so the Time Cops outlaw it".<br/><br/>I'm looking for a convincing fake reason, possibly based on social norms, laws or even science. <br/><br/>One thought was that having two sets of the same people in the general same area creates small pockets of instabilities, which over time can cause lots of problems, so it's only allowed under the most extreme circumstances.<br/><br/>Or, I'm thinking of possibly introducing some kind of illness which you may catch (ala the movie PRIMER) if you come into contact/nearness with yourself, which is just enough to put people on edge to not want to try it.<br/><br/>Any other thoughts?<br/><br/>As for the adventure, the PCs are currently all working together (2 time cops, one engineer, and one criminal-turned-state's witness) and are currently in the Victorian era tracking down Jack the Ripper (a time traveller from the future). The question came up of, "If we don't stop him, what's to stop us from going back again and trying again?"  Now, the players aren't being dicks or anything to try to wedge the system (in fact, they agreed themselves to fail to stop the first murder to adhere to the typical criminal drama conventions), and we're not going all ballz-out with tracking potential paradoxes ala Continuum, but we're looking for something with some teeth, that geeky SF folks watching such a show could go, "Yeah, I buy that".<br/><br/>-Andy                </div>

                            Well, see... time travellers have this particular subatomic resonance, see, what with their atoms being blasted into a different point in time. (This resonance, by the way, acts as a sort of key for getting back to the original time frame.) If the same person goes back to the same time at a slightly different point in the present (and they're all "slightly," relatively speaking), this signature is almost identical but ever-so-slightly different. If matter with one signature ever comes into contact with matter with the second signature, something not unlike a matter-antimatter reaction occurs, maybe even obliterating all extant matter containing both signatures.<br/>
<br/>
Note that this reaction applies to stuff you might not easily notice, like dead skin, hair, sweat, whatever. So it's more worrisome than, "If you go back again, just don't touch your other self, or kablooey."                        </div>

                            There's a John Crowley short novel where he goes back in time to tell his young self to do or not do some particular thing. It's psychologically not okay - he never remembers it, only a sound like lions roaring.<br/>
<br/>
...Or maybe I'm mangling the story. Anyhow, putting yourself in a position where you can remember watching yourself do what you're doing now - it collapses causality and free will into a death spiral. Even if it doesn't break time, it can certainly break your mind.<br/>
<br/>
So such missions require much better preparation, stronger safeguards, and a ton more pre- and post-counseling than normal missions do. The time cop agency can do them, but they're insane costly.<br/>

                            I'm reminded ot the solution used in Anne McCaffrey's Pern books. Being in the same Time in multiple places is really hard on the human psyche. The closer you are in space, the worse it gets. Actually directly interacting with yourself is likely to drive you insane.<br/>
<br/>
As for why... how about this?<br/>
You know that quantum property where you separate two parts of the same thing, and when you vibrate one, the other vibrates at the same time regardless of distance? What if there's something like that in the human mind (or soul, if you want a slightly more spiritual take). Normally, it's not a problem because there's only one copy at a time in existence, but the moment you put two in the same time-stream, they start resonating off each other, build up a harmonic thingy, and eventually snap, leaving you either insane or brain-dead.                        </div>

                            A twist on Albert's: gesture vaguely at Robert Penrose's book on the quantum mind and state that when two copies are too close together at the same time, they begin to share each other's thoughts and perceptions--essentially having the 'same brain' in two places.  Worse yet, if you are too close for too long, the bond cannot be broken just by leaving the shared time.  It gets weaker, but 'flashbacks' and 'flash forwards' are possible.<br/>
<br/>
Now there is the very expensive tin foil hat that can solve this problem, but it's still in beta testing.  The last version was only successful half of the time and the tech boys haven't figured out why yet...<br/>
<br/>
Cool thing: you could totally make one of the missions to save someone real important before they scramble their brains trying to talk to themselves.                        </div>

                            Conservation of matter.  People from the future are composed of just an atom from here or there in the past, so nobody notices when they spontaneously  warp together to form a body somewhere else on the planet.  But if there are two of you running around at the same time, those atoms don't know where to go, and you end up with half of you as a bloody mess in each location.                        </div>

                            The way Legacy of Kain handles it:<br/><br/>Time is a river that flows down a path. Certain actions just redirect the river, still hitting certain forks in the future. Those forks, those very special events that have more significance, can only be changed by a very directed action or set of actions. Neither heads nor tails, but the coin landing on the side. When time is altered at those points, it acts in two ways: it redoes all of the future forks, nothing is necessarily the same as it was before, except for future critical points.<br/><br/>Specifical to your question: Time travellers, once they've made their first travel, are susceptible to the time stream in certain ways. And when they've altered a critical point, it's like they become charged or magnetized. They can approach the scene but the closer they get the more time repels them.<br/><br/>Does that work?                        </div>

                            The time machine power required (or psychic energy required) to travel back to a place you've already visited is exponentially higher than the first trip.

                            Use the Chrononauts explanation: the time periods  that the PCs visit are Lynchpins and inherently fragile to the spacetime continuum, blah blah blah, thin enough to permit matter/energy to pass, but not strong enough to hold more than X amount of extra matter/energy.<br/><br/>Like blowing a bubble- when it gets to a certain large size, you can see a bit through it and can add only a tiny bit more air before the whole thing collapses into a huge gooey mess, blah blah blah, timequakes and the ripple effect cause chaos and destruction and so forth.<br/><br/>This sounds pretty cool- do you have a free slot? <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>BTW, avoid the movie A Sound of Thunder.<br/><br/>MDK                        </div>

                            What if you don't get a new body each time you get sent back to a particular period, only the first time - so if you get sent back to a time when you're already there, you end up as a little voice in the back of your own head, but you don't get a new body?  The only way to avoid it is to go back significantly earlier (you can fudge what 'significantly' means by talking about margins of error) and get everything done before your first-time-back consciousness plonks down in your body and shoves you into the backseat.<br/><br/>I don't know if I actually like the idea, but it's an idea.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>In your position I think I'd go even more mundane than Jess' suggestion.  I'd totally let them try a mission multiple times.  Yup.  I would.  I'd ward off the lameness by making sure that each successive failure just gets <em>insanely</em> worse than the last.  Know what I'm talking about?  Like, the first time they fail to stop ol' Jack, they manage to drive him to kill twice as many as he would have without their help.  The second time they fail to stop him he spawns a cult of untouchable mass-murderers.  The third time, that cult spreads across the whole of Europe.  Etc, etc.</p>
<p>Of course, I'd make this intention explicit with the players.  Too many screwups means they fuck with history in ways that get out of their reach to fix.  I guess I'd imagine it as a situation where the fabric of time and causality is generally just too complex for a handful of timecops to fix on their own.  But when they can hit the nail on the head in one shot, it gets fixed.  Miss that one shot and cause ripples in causailty that just get out of hand.</p>

                            Yeah, but what do you do when they're like "okay, time to kill off Jack in the womb."  Because, really, a primary motivator of time travel is as the ultimate in historiography.  And the other primary motivator is to kill off Evil People in the womb.  On the other hand, there's a definite story in the do-good time traveller trying to correct that one thing and making it worse and worse and worse and worse.  Sort of a Phillip Jose Farmer vibe.<br/>
<br/>
I'd pitch my hat in Jess's camp here.  Because the number and variety of crazy regulations regarding time travel could be enormous.  For instance: can you imagine the accounting that has to occur if you leave something in the past?  How do you ammortize capital that was purchased yesterday, but is now 250 years old?  And how much worse if you now have two identical pieces of equipment because they've travelled to the same moment in time?                        </div>

                            Andy, if you could give us the other BS Science behind how time travel works, then a solution could be developed that reinforced those reasonings. That is, wokring in a vaccuum here is probably not as effective if we knew how your time travel works. Also we can't check for any inconsistencies in what we and others propose (which, after all, is part of the fun of these mind-games). <br>
<br>
The BS Science often tells us what sort of thing it's OK to handwave, and what not, too. <br/>

                            Here's the closest-to-actual-physics explanation I can give:<br/>
<br/>
Feedback.<br/>
<br/>
See, each time traveller carries a wormhole trace with them -- it's how they get through time.  (this doesn't have to be an object, it can just be a "trace" on their body, so no need to worry about the effects budget)  If a wormhole comes into contact with the same wormhole from a different time, feedback starts.  It starts out with light -- there's a little glow around the traveller.  As they get closer, there is a keen, high pitched noise like microphone feedback, and the light gets more intense.  Closer still, and matter (dust) starts to build up in a cloud around them.  Even closer and -- bang!  In a flash of light, the wormhole collapses, stranding them in time.  Or outside of time.  Or, if you're feeling more boom-y, the world explodes *and* the wormhole collapses.<br/>
<br/>
yrs--<br/>
--Ben<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  If I used this in a game, I'd not explain what feedback does past to sound stage.  Why?  No one has ever tried the experiment.  I mean, you could blow up the world or get stranded out of time or both!<br/>
<br/>
That way, when it happens in your game, you can make up some crazy-ass-shit.                        </div>

                            Here's an idea.  If someone goes back in time and encounters himself, there's two of him when he goes back to his own time (the one who went back and the one who didn't).  The time agency hates it when that happens, and "disappears" one of him.                        </div>

                            To describe it briefly:<br/><br/>We went with a combination of "It's a beaurocratic mess" (so if they screw up, another team goes in, and same for the PC agents when another team fails). We also added in a dash of Ben's reasoning as well, so any time where the same agents come to the same area 3-5 times things start getting messy. And because of lingering time particles, the same is true when the PCs go and fix other agent's messes (but they can do so 6-8 times before things start getting risky). So both of those solutions worked great for us.<br/><br/>As for the background of the game:<br/><br/>Around 23XX, time travel is invented. Almost instantly, a time travel agency is formed to patrol time (for evil, rogue time travelers, and other time visitors who end up drawing attention to themselves. This agency spans several hundred (if not thousand) years. <br/><br/>The agency spans several buildings in several time regions: Ex: In 1934 New York City, the 7th precint police office leads to the offices of the Agency. You just walk through the right doors and next thing you know you're passing rooms of people using typewriters to track time changes, to rooms of people with shaved heads and closed eyes sitting surrounding a stream of energy, to rooms of medieval scribes writing in dusty tomes, to rooms of Mayan mathematicians knotting rope. Anyway, that's where the offices are, and in several places at several junctures they have offices.  It's only when unexpected time events happen that the agents have to actually use a time machine to go from the offices to the scene of the event (which happens a lot). <br/><br/>The time machines look like a simple roller-coaster carriage: Sit in it, press a few buttons, and a tunnel of time wraps around the carriage. The surroundings bend, bubble and warp while the carriage seems to stay still. Then the new time reality zips around the players and they arrive. Takes about 10 seconds.<br/><br/>For some reason, no one can travel past June 11th, 2396. No one knows why. When people try, they find that their gear is sabotaged, etc. And the more they try, the more unfortunate things happen to them (including things like receiving notes written in their own handwriting that say "Don't go past June 11th, 2396"). It's widely guessed that after that date something BIG happens, and agents from the future with a better control of time travel are ensuring that no one breaks that barrier.<br/><br/>Also, for some reason no one can travel through the years 16000-18000 BC: When that era is set, for some reason at some point during the trip the ride stops and nothing happens. There's a lot of scientific theories as to why this is.<br/><br/>Other than that, the players have been having a lot of fun inventing new TECH placeholders for time events, time complications, time devices and the like, and it's been great so far. One of the players (Jeremie) is playing a "hacker working for the FBI" type, assisting the time agency to catch others.  But it's clear that he has his own agenda, and he doesn't call himself "Napoleon" for no reason. In real life, Jeremie is leaving in two weeks to do psych research in London for the summer, so he won't be able to join us for a few months, and we took this chance to basically gear him up as an ongoing Antagonist/Nemesis. Next week is his big betrayal, and after that Jeremie leaves and his character will become an NPC.<br/><br/>Last week the players stopped Jack the Ripper, next week they're going to the Wild West, which (in the middle of their investigation) suddenly changes into a French-owned colony/region (which will prompt them to go back further to find the cause, which will be the Napoleon thing).<br/><br/>Everyone's really digging it, and while we've already charted out a few major events, there's a lot of places to fill in the gaps. There's been no problem even with the players narrating out the setting and events, while I as the GM have been doing a little of the traditional GM thing by keeping campaign secrets up my sleeve (which the players wanted: Also, I've been changing them, enhancing them or ditching them for the players' ideas when they're better).<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm both wired and tired, so sorry about any bizarre grammar.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

                            No one comes back!!! Once someone goes to that time and lives through to the next day, they're never heard from again, recording equipment stops recording, etc.  And in most cases, once they have the intention of going forward to that time, they're still thwarted, but only three times: After that, they can travel to a day, a week, etc beforehand unhindered... but never come back.<br/><br/>(or at least, that's the story I just came up with, and I'm sticking to it ;-) )                        </div>
