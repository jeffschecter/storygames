A player walked out and later complained that there was little roleplaying and combat had been too hard, for which he blamed the GM.<br/><br/>My first experience was similar. Simon was GMing. We began with a combat.<br/><br/>Immediately, I had no idea what I was doing. I knew that, on my turn, I could roll a d20 to hit. But I didn't know what I needed to roll: so, when I rolled the die, someone would tell me whether I'd hit. There were lots of bonuses, which I didn't understand.<br/><br/>Most frustratingly, there wasn't a default "You hit something" option. It all had names like "Incandescent Slap". I generally had no idea whether I wanted to use an Incandescent Slap or a Poke Of Death. I just wanted to hit stuff.<br/><br/>When I did hit, I wasn't sure what the damage was. There were various formulae on my character sheet. There was also a symbol, [W], which wasn't explained. <br/><br/>Sometimes, I got hit. When this happened, someone told me to use a healing surge, so I did.<br/><br/>While I was being mystified, everyone else seemed to be having fun. They all had rulebooks and were flicking backwards and forwards, trying to get bonuses. There were things called flanking bonuses, which were good, and were apparently the reason we were moving things around a map. I was not sure how to get these. I thought you might attack while standing beside someone else, but no.<br/><br/>Every round, people would do interesting things. Then play came back to me. I rolled my die. Someone told me whether I hit or not. I rolled another die. Someone else told me how much damage I did.<br/><br/>This went on forever. Eventually, I gave up, and rested my head on a pair of batteries that were lying on the table. I was very, very irritated.<br/><br/>Since then, I've played 4th Edition again. I'm starting to see how it might be fun. But it really does assume lots of prior knowledge, which rather punishes new players. You couldn't just sit casually down for a 4E game. You need to read up, first.<br/><br/>This, I think, gives the GM much power. The GM <i>has</i> to know all this stuff before running the game. So, if you're fairly new, the GM will know many more tricks than you do.<br/><br/>So there you go. My experience was, I think, remarkably similar to that of Michael's player.<br/><br/>Could I ask you to post slowly and thoughtfully to this thread? My basic nightmare is that I check Story Games in two hours and there's twenty posts, most of them from Adam, talking about the minutiae of 4th Edition. But I'm interested to talk about it.

Definitely this.  Sorry Graham, but your horrible experience the first time you played 4E had nothing to do with 4E.  It just has to do with the fact that you sat down without knowing any of the rules.  You didn't read the rules, and no one explained them to you, apparently not even during the course of the game.  This would be no different if you were attempting to play any other game without knowing the rules:<br/><br/>GM: Okay, now you roll dice.<br/>Player: What? Why? Which dice?<br/>GM: *sigh* Just roll.<br/>Player: But... what?<br/>GM: Roll, dammit!<br/><br/>Obviously you're not going to have fun.<br/><br/>The 4E system isn't even that complex (though still much more complex than most of the indie games that Story Games patrons tend to love).  It's much simpler to 3.5, when it comes to things like possible bonuses (e.g. you either have combat advantage or you don't) and opportunity attacks (only two types of actions provoke, and that's it).  However, like every game, you do have to read the rules (or at least be taught the rules) if you want to enjoy the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229379">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229379/#Comment_229379" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:09:52+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:09PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 3:56PM by Eric.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite>The 4E system isn't even that complex (though still much more complex than most of the indie games that Story Games patrons tend to love).</blockquote>\nYou're a lunatic. JDCorley might be, too, provided he meant 'complicated like chess' as something I should carry to its logical conclusion. 4E is extremely complex (edit: he's not). The 4E PHB is over 300 pages long, with a two-column layout and a large page size, and you really ought to read (large!) parts of the DMG and MM to understand how the game works as a whole. "Introduction to Electrodynamics" by D.J. Griffiths is about 550 pages, but only a single column layout and a much smaller paper size. It also contains a great many worked examples and homework problems for students. I'd say the overall amount of text is similar. If you cut the examples and problems out of the electrodynamics text, it's going to be substantially shorter than the PHB.<br/><br/>Learning 4E front-to-back and learning undergraduate electrodynamics front-to-back involve similar amounts of reading (the amount of thinking will depend on the person in question; 4E uses rather less math). God help you if you're playing a non-core class or are interested in splatbook powers. <br/><br/>4E is an extremely complicated game, not due to depth but due to pure volume of rules. The rules of chess are tiny in comparison. Remembering how the various pieces move is the bulk of the chess rules set. 4E is a system that strongly favors rules mastery of a very large amount of rules, as previous editions did before it. Is it less complex than 3.5? Maybe, but that's damning with faint praise. <br/><br/>Someone can sit me down and teach me a complicated Euro-game like Puerto Rico in about 20 minutes. We can play through a practice game in another hour. I then know the <i>entirety</i> of the rules, have seen them all in action, and I can focus on playing well. You cannot do that with 4E. If you are following Adam's advice, you can bring a new player up to speed on the absolute core basics, but that's not rules mastery by a long shot. You have got to be at least as careful as Adam about this. This game is big and complicated and confusing to a newcomer, and skimming the rules for 30 minutes before the first session simply does not cut it for a beginner to get on board. <br/><br/>Graham, I've had similar experiences, but from the other side. For our first session, I was the only player who showed up with a completed character sheet, and I spent the first several sessions coaching the other players. A few times, I resorted to 'okay, do this. Now do that.' I was often worried about killing the fun, too. I think we managed, but better pedagogy is definitely a big need in this side of the hobby.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>After eight sessions, D&amp;D 4e felt like an endless round of buying groceries in Slovak currency to me.<br/><br/>JASON:  (Holds out hand full of Slovak coins) I have this much coins.<br/>DUNGEON MASTER:  (Takes some coins) OK you do this awesome thing.<br/>JASON:  Can I have an apple now?<br/>DUNGEON MASTER:  No, but here is a golf pencil.

No, don't do that, it's bad, just MOVE AND SHOOT."  \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stou'n</cite><br/><b>Here's how your character is different</b><br/>* roles: your powers can help other people<br/>* at-will vs. encounter vs. daily powers<br/>* rolling a power, calculate damage, [W] means your weapon's regular dice, so 2[W] means roll twice your weapon regular dice</blockquote>\nColor-coded cards are extremely helpful for this - you can use the blue one as much as you want, you flip the red one over when you use it and get it back at the end of the fight, you flip the yellow on over when you use it and get it back when you take a long rest (or whatever the real colors are).

Sorry.  But my own worries evaporated, completely, after I got the Character Builder software that Wizards has.  I snapped the guy together in there, and printed.

I remember saying I wanted my character to bulldog a guy to the ground, and a 10-15 minute debate among the <i>other </i>players as to whether I meant Bulls Rush, charging, a move-through or some other thing I had no idea what they were talking about. When I finally said "the first one" they spent another 10 minutes figuring out what all bonuses and penalties I'd face. <br/><br/>By the time I actually was supposed to roll dice, I just wanted to let the guy kill my character and go get a beer out of the fridge.<br/><br/>ME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229383/#Comment_229383" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:20:55+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:20PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 3:26PM by Eric.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>And I'm wondering whether it automatically gives the GM an advantage.<br/><br/>Graham</blockquote>\nIn my experience, it just gives the advantage to the most rules-savvy person at the table, GM or player. Here's an example: 4E uses a complicated system to manage who the monsters attack. By default, the monster should go after the softest, most dangerous target. If everyone is equally dangerous, then simply the softest target. Defender classes change the equation in specific ways. If the GM is savvy, they will go through the analysis and figure out if this new whammy the Defender put on the monster is a big enough deal to change the monster's mind. If they're not, they'll 'respect the mark' and attack whoever you want them to.<br/><br/>Concrete example: the monster can attack the rogue or the paladin. The monster needs to roll a 6 or better to hit the rogue, and an 11 or better to hit the paladin. The paladin uses 'mark,' an ability that says 'attack me or take a penalty.' Now the monster needs to roll an 8 or better to hit the rogue. Baring anything else, the monster should still attack the rogue. If the GM lacks that level of rules mastery, though, they will (unwisely!) go after the paladin, 'respecting the mark' rather than doing the math. A rules-savvy player can then manipulate the battlefield in ways that would be impossible with a more rules-savvy GM.<br/><br/>Now, is that fair? Well, in that anyone could have read and memorized those rules, yes. Is it reasonable? That's a harder question. It is certainly a heavy burden, and doubly so in a game that is nominally competitive. And yes, I'd say that lacking it is extremely crippling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229388">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229388/#Comment_229388" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T15:28:26+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  3:28PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 3:46PM by GB_Steve.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some of us had read the rules, all of us, except Graham had played the game before on the launch night. And generally it was much more old school, a style which seems of more interest to some of the other players. It was also pretty much solid combat for several hours, with a daft premise and not much opportunity for roleplay beyond a bit of paladin baiting.<br/><br/>When we played AD&amp;D, we pretty much got straight into that too, at the same level (1st) but you seemed much happier with that, although you didn't do any fighting and it was a combat light game anyway. But I don't know how much you know about AD&amp;D.<br/><br/>I didn't really enjoy the game either, possibly for similar reasons to Graham. I know tons about AD&amp;D, I've no particular desire to learn it all again for a parallel system. And besides, I don't like the way the system has concreted over the fantasy world in bland uniformity of system so that roles are known and understood, tactics are worked out like chess moves and nothing is magical or mysterious or just plain wrong. Also XPs suck big ones.

Let me break this down a little. <br/><br/>Sometimes I want to learn a game. When I do this I often read the book. Sometimes I read the book a couple of times. Sometimes I read the book a couple of times, run practices, check online forums to see what other people are saying about the game, make lots of characters and have them have conflicts with each others, and other stuff. <br/><br/>When I want to learn a game, I'm usually going to be willing to put in a significant amount of effort into the learning of the game. There's all sorts of reasons for this, from geek status to my academic background, but it isn't just me and it isn't just RPGs. A lot of chess players, for example, read books about chess, study famous games of chess, read biographies of famous chess players, get chess tutor programs, and so on and on. <br/><br/>The truth is, however, sometimes I don't want to learn a game. Its rather a lot of effort, and takes time. So sometimes its something I won't do, or something I can't do. <br/><br/>There are times where I want to be taught a game. Because I'm me and have status issues, this is less common for me. (I'm the magical GM, I cannot be taught, I only teach!) But even then, sometimes I like someone who has some level of mastery of the game to explain the game to me, to help me grasp the methods and modes of play, and to tutor and mentor me in my progression of skills through the game. Sometimes this is a casual kind of teaching, sometimes its more involved. (Like teaching me PowerGrid is pretty simple, but my dad teaching me chess was a long process that went on over years.) <br/><br/>Often I like to teach games. I like to help others learn how to play the game, how to maximize their enjoyment of the game, to gain mastery of system, and to get what they're looking for out of their play. Sometimes I teach them to play the game blank, sometimes I teach them how to play the game with me. But there are certainly times where it is fun to teach someone -- mostly when they want to be taught the game. Less so when they just want to play, and rarely at all when they want to learn the game, unless we're both clear about that ahead of time. (Because the divide between being a teacher and being someone you're just chatting with to improve your own mastery can be important.) <br/><br/>And then there are the times where I just want to play a game. I don't want to read the rules, and I don't want someone teaching me the fucking thing, I just want to goddamn play. If I don't know the game that's often okay, I'll figure it out as I go along, and if I'm confused that's fine, that's part of the price of just playing without having to learn or be taught. (I suppose one could call this learning in the school of hard knocks, but for me its a separate issue. Times when I want to learn the game through playing are different than times when I just want to play.) <br/><br/>I remember that about a year ago while Thomas was up here visiting, we played PowerGrid. Thomas had been working at learning the game, thinking a lot about it, playing it with different people to improve his mastery, etc. Mo wanted to be taught the game, so she asked Thomas a lot of questions, let him give her suggestions, and generally made it her job the first couple times of play to pick up and master the rules, then move on to deeper complexities. I just wanted to play the goddamn game, and barely even paid attention while Thomas was explaining the basic rules cause that was too much thinking. <br/><br/>So when I read your experience with D&amp;D 4th, I can't help but think there is something along the same lines going on there. D&amp;D 4 is, in a real way, a game that depends on players (or at least a few key players) learning the game (that is, reading the books, talking about it, thinking about it, practicing it...) so that they can teach the game to the other players (by mentoring, tutorials, ongoing pedagogical help during play, etc.) so that eventually everyone can just play the game. But it sounds like you hadn't had much interest in learning the game before the game, and while you were willing to be taught it doesn't sound like you weren't actively looking for it or soliciting it (nor was anyone going out of their way to give it). <br/><br/>And there are a lot of games that are simple enough that even in a situation like that you can just play them. (I won that first game of Power Grid, despite having no fucking clue what I was doing.) But when you try to just play D&amp;D 4th without having done the previous work... well, the results aren't always great. <br/><br/>(I've heard that D&amp;D is designed that way semi on purpose, btw. It's a system mastery game where learning the rules gives power to those who've put in the work and gives a feeling of pride and status to those who have done it.) <br/><br/>I also think its worth noting that a lot of Indie games are actually not all that easy to learn (having poorly written books), are very easy to be taught (notice how many folks get hooked on a game after playing it at a con with a more veteran player?), and many of them can just be played (if suboptimally) without having to do either. So when you hit D&amp;D 4, which is way out of that paradigm, well... it sucked.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229424/#Comment_229424" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T17:42:54+00:00" title="September  1, 2009  5:42PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 5:43PM by J_Walton.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>Monsters don't do Math.</blockquote>\nMaybe not, but the game seems to suck a lot less if they do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229465/#Comment_229465" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T22:11:32+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 10:11PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2009 10:11PM by Bryant.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>In my experience, it just gives the advantage to the most rules-savvy person at the table, GM or player.

If everyone is equally dangerous, then simply the softest target. Defender classes change the equation in specific ways. If the GM is savvy, they will go through the analysis and figure out if this new whammy the Defender put on the monster is a big enough deal to change the monster's mind. If they're not, they'll 'respect the mark' and attack whoever you want them to.</blockquote>\nCould you quote me the rules section that explains this complicated system?

JDCorley might be, too, provided he meant 'complicated like chess' as something I should carry to its logical conclusion. 4E is extremely complex (edit: he's not). The 4E PHB is over 300 pages long, with a two-column layout and a large page size, and you really ought to read (large!) parts of the DMG and MM to understand how the game works as a whole. "Introduction to Electrodynamics" by D.J. Griffiths is about 550 pages, but only a single column layout and a much smaller paper size. It also contains a great many worked examples and homework problems for students. I'd say the overall amount of text is similar. If you cut the examples and problems out of the electrodynamics text, it's going to be substantially shorter than the PHB.</blockquote>\nNow this is just ridiculous.  First of all, the only things a player might want to know from the MM are included on the first few pages, and maybe the glossary.  From the DMG, just the encounter creation rules and skill challenges.  As for the PHB, most of it can be ignored by any new player.  You don't need to know all the powers from most of the classes, and only need to know a few powers from you own class.  You definitely don't need to know the stats for every single item, or the bonuses provided by every feat in the game.<br/><br/>All you need to know is how to make a character, the basics of how to make skill checks (and what your skills might be useful for), and how combat works.  This is probably about 50 pages total.  The rest of the book just contains pieces (feats, powers, items) that you plug into your character, and have nothing to do with knowing how to play.  I hate to be making this comparison, but it's a lot like playing a CCG (e.g. Magic: the Gathering).  The rules on "how to play" are relatively short and simple, and comprise a small subset of all the rules in the game, but the rest are contained on the individual cards, and you do not need to know what every single card in the game does in order to play successfully.<br/><br/>You're highly exaggerating the amount of rules involved, especially when comparing to previous editions.  For example, what Bryant has quoted above, and this quote from another thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>Figuring out what used to caused an Attack of Opportunity that still does, what used to but now does not, what didn't before but now does, what new things that seem like they ought to but don't...</blockquote>\nThe rules for opportunity attacks are clearly stated in the combat chapter of the PHB.  In 3.5, there was a chart of provoking actions, and god help you if ever tried to do something not covered by that chart.  In 4E, they clearly state what actions provoke: using a Ranged or Area power in a threated square, or voluntarily moving out of a threatened square without shifting or teleporting.  That's it.  If you're frustrated by that, you're just making things more difficult for yourself by assuming that there's more complication than there actually is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229481">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229481/#Comment_229481" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T23:28:22+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 11:28PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>What I'm suggesting is that 4th Edition requires a<i>particularly large</i>amount of prior knowledge....I'm also suggesting that the knowledge required creates a large barrier to entry for new players.

D&amp;D, in any incarnation, is much more complicated than, say 3:16, or IAWA, when it comes to rules.  If you really want to be able to play it, some investment must be made.  I also think Brand makes a good point here:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brand_Robins</cite>I also think its worth noting that a lot of Indie games are actually not all that easy to learn (having poorly written books), are very easy to be taught (notice how many folks get hooked on a game after playing it at a con with a more veteran player?), and many of them can just be played (if suboptimally) without having to do either.

Later on, when I finally read through the book, I realized that I would've been absolutely lost if I had tried to play it without anyone to guide me through it.  There's a certain understanding involved in running a good game of IAWA that isn't well addressed by the book.<br/><br/>D&amp;D has the opposite problem: the rules are pretty damned clear in the book, but teaching all the details isn't particularly easy, because there are a lot of them.  Such is generally the nature of traditional-style games, as opposed to the indie story games we all know and love.  It's an intrinsic problem of traditional-style games, and can't really be solved without changing the nature of the game.  The best that can be done from the designer's perspective is to provide quickstart rules, tutorials, etc. but no matter what, the player is still going to have to put a certain amount of time into learning the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229486/#Comment_229486" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T23:54:15+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 11:54PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 12:09AM by Eric.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bryant</cite><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>In my experience, it just gives the advantage to the most rules-savvy person at the table, GM or player. Here's an example: 4E uses a complicated system to manage who the monsters attack. By default, the monster should go after the softest, most dangerous target. If everyone is equally dangerous, then simply the softest target. Defender classes change the equation in specific ways. If the GM is savvy, they will go through the analysis and figure out if this new whammy the Defender put on the monster is a big enough deal to change the monster's mind. If they're not, they'll 'respect the mark' and attack whoever you want them to.</blockquote>\nCould you quote me the rules section that explains this complicated system? Cause I have apparently been doing it wrong. I do this weird thing where I think about the sketched out personality of the monsters, and I have them act accordingly, and my players have more fun.<br/>Actually, you know what? Sure. Because it's illustrative. In the interests of not getting WotC to issues Cease and Desist letters to Andy, I'm going to try to keep fulltext quoting at a minimum. <br/><br/>Reminder: the context is still rules mastery, as Graham originally brought up. <br/><br/>Preview: for most monsters, Bryant is doing it wrong based on the actual rules of the game. Hence, this is a good example of a DM whose lack of rules mastery may be exploited for tactical gain. That's not to say that Bryant is running a bad game, and maybe tactical edges aren't even that important to you. However, Bryant seems ignorant of the fact that there is indeed rules text telling you how the monsters should be played and who they ought to target.<br/> <br/>To begin with, let's look at the MM, page 6:\n<blockquote><b>Role</b> <br/>A monster\u2019s role describes its preferred combat tactics, much <br/>as a character class\u2019s role suggests tactics for PCs. Monster <br/>roles are: artillery, brute, controller, lurker, skirmisher, <br/>and soldier. These roles are discussed in the Dungeon Master\u2019s <br/>Guide. <br/> A monster might have the leader keyword in parenthe- <br/>ses, indicating that it grants some sort of boon to its allies in <br/>combat, such as a beneficial aura.</blockquote>\nNext, we turn to the DMG, page 40:\n<blockquote>Basic Tactics: The Monster Manual suggests basic <br/>tactics for the monsters in its pages. Your first guide<br/>to a monster\u2019s behavior in combat, though, is its role.<br/>Artillery monsters avoid melee and favor their ranged<br/>attacks. Skirmishers move a lot and avoid the front<br/>line. Soldiers and brutes engage the party\u2019s defenders<br/>and leaders. Controllers position themselves to make<br/>best use of their abilities.</blockquote>\nTaken together, we see that the monster's role serves as the core of what it should be doing in combat - not its personality, not its motivations, not its instincts. You might think that's dumb, and you'd be within your rights to feel that way. However, 4E has clearly-written rules that define what the first and foremost combat behavior for a monster ought to be.<br/><br/>What other rules are provided in this regard? Well, pages 40-41 of the DMG contain additional text. The rules indicate that monsters typically ignore fallen characters rather than intentionally damaging them, and that dragging a fallen character away is a slow process unless the monster is very strong. They rules state that smart monsters should act differently than dumb ones - but within the context of their role, as defined previously in the section. The rules state that monsters should unload their biggest attacks as fast as possible.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, page 6 of the MM provides additional rules text in support of this. It defines monster type, and notes that type modifies behavior. Furthermore, individual monster statblocks define individual tactics for a given monster, putting the monster's abilities into context with its role. <br/><br/>Thus, there is a great deal of specific rules text that tells you what you ought to be doing with a monster. A savvy player will know this and anticipate. A savvy player will also know when the GM is fudging or going against type - and that might lead to clashes of expectation. However, on a purely system-mastery level, there are indeed plenty of rules that tell you what monsters should be doing by default.<br/><br/>What else do the rules tell you about how to use monsters? The entirety of chapter 4 details this, including lengthly definitions of monster roles, composition of monster groups, XP budgeting for encounter-building, and also a host of terrain rules and so forth. Again, system mastery shows itself: a rules-savvy player knows precisely how hard its going to be to cross a given terrain type to engage monster X, and that player will have a very clear notion what the rewards for success and consequences of failure are within the battle as a whole. A rules-savvy GM can much more effectively orchestrate these elements into a challenging, cohesive encounter that is understandable and accessible via the rules as written.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229487">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229487/#Comment_229487" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-01T23:54:26+00:00" title="September  1, 2009 11:54PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 12:59AM by Eric.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            part II:<br/><br/>Now let's move to the player side of things. Critically, the fact that Defender characters have abilities to manage who the enemy attacks <i>at all</i> only makes sense in the context of the above monster rules. The only way it is reasonable to give someone the ability to change a monster's mind about what it's going to do is if the monster had a clearly-defined thing it was going to do in the first place. Indeed, the ability to do this is central to the definition of a Defender. Page 16 of the PHB states:\n<blockquote>Defender (Fighter, Paladin) <br/>Defenders have the highest defenses in the game and <br/>good close-up offense. They are the party\u2019s front-line <br/>combatants; wherever they\u2019re standing, that\u2019s where <br/>the action is. Defenders have abilities and powers that <br/>make it difficult for enemies to move past them or to <br/>ignore them in battle.</blockquote>\nHow does the Fighter, for example, achieve this? Through the 'marking' system. This defines a basic status effect with a basic penalty, plus an additional triggered effect to act as a special class-specific incentive for the monster. Page 76 of the PHB states:\n<blockquote>...Every time you attack an enemy, whether the attack hits <br/>or misses, you can choose to mark that target. The mark <br/>lasts until the end of your next turn. While a target <br/>is marked, it takes a \u20132 penalty to attack rolls for any <br/>attack that doesn\u2019t include you as a target. A creature <br/>can be subject to only one mark at a time. A new mark <br/>supersedes a mark that was already in place. <br/> In addition, whenever a marked enemy that is <br/>adjacent to you shifts or makes an attack that does not <br/>include you, you can make a melee basic attack against <br/>that enemy as an immediate interrupt.</blockquote>\nNote that this never forces anything on the monster. It offers a deal: hit me (the toughest nut to crack of the group) rather than my friends (who are probably easier to hit and potentially more offensively dangerous) or I'll whale on you even more and make you eat a to-hit penalty.<br/><br/>So, let's put this together. A Vampire Lord is a level 11 elite lurker. Since it's a lurker, it specifically wants to avoid the defender (DMG pg. 62). It's also intelligent enough to focus attacks on the most dangerous foe (DMG pg. 41). So, the Vampire Lord is happily munching on Mr. Laser Cleric (a big threat to him) when the fighter runs up from behind, hits the bloodsucker, and marks him. What happens now? <br/><br/>Well, the mark doesn't say you have to do anything at all. It provides incentives to do this or that. The Vampire has to choose between continuing to focus on the cleric while getting beat on extra-hard by the fighter, or ignoring the dangerous cleric and focusing on the tank - the hardiest opponent he faces. Which should he do? Well, you can ignore the mark arbitrarily, since Vampires are lurkers and lurkers avoid defenders. That's within your rights. You could target the defender arbitrarily. That's less reasonable - what if the dangerous cleric was nearly down for the count? Or you could do the math, in the context of the monster's role, tactics, and intelligence. And lo and behold, here's where we get some real emergent depth from the rules! <br/><br/>If there's a Fruitful Void in DnD combat tactics, this is it - the rules are all there to create just this kind of interesting trade-off, where default behavior, monster traits, and tactical context combine to create interesting choice. And you ruin that depth, or you never see it to begin with, without sufficient rules mastery. You never know what the Vampire Lord ought to do by default. You have no idea if it should be picking its battles or charging heedlessly. You look and the fighter's mark, shrug, and say 'whatever.' <br/><br/><b>Graham's right:</b> that lack of rules mastery is terribly punishing. You need to know all of this stuff before the interesting emergent properties of the rules begin to unfold. And, if you're like Bryant, your own belief that you're doing it right might make you miss interesting and fun depths of the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229490/#Comment_229490" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T00:02:39+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 12:02AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 12:10AM by Eric.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite><br/>Figuring out what used to caused an Attack of Opportunity that still does, what used to but now does not, what didn't before but now does, what new things that seem like they ought to but don't...</blockquote>\nThe rules for opportunity attacks are clearly stated in the combat chapter of the PHB.  In 3.5, there was a chart of provoking actions, and god help you if ever tried to do something not covered by that chart.  In 4E, they clearly state what actions provoke: using a Ranged or Area power in a threated square, or voluntarily moving out of a threatened square without shifting or teleporting.  That's it.  If you're frustrated by that, you're just making things more difficult for yourself by assuming that there's more complication than there actually is.<br/>You missed the context.

As this is not an edition-conversion thread, it's not germane.<br/><br/>What is germane are your statements about the amount of text needed for rules competence and rules mastery. Let's set the rules mastery issue aside. 50 pages is still way too much for basic rules competence, but I'm skeptical. Can you make that more concrete? A page-by-page survey of the PHB, MM, and DMG, with the result being the 'core reading list'? I don't think that exists anywhere, or at least I've never seen it, so it might be a valuable resource. Of course, we have the Quickstart rules from the 4E preview adventure release. Do you think those are sufficient?

I know someone over there had a list.  Let me see if I can find it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Edit: found it!  The minimum essential reading in PHB as determined by a bunch of people on the official 4E forums:<br/><br/>1. \u201cThree Basic Rules\u201d on page 11 (&lt; 1 page)<br/>2. \u201cPower Types and Usage\u201d on page 54 (&lt; 1 page)<br/>3. \u201cShort Rest + Extended Rest\u201d on page Page 263 (&lt; 1 page)<br/>4.

"Conditions" Page 277 (1 page)<br/>Total: ~38 pages.<br/><br/>Beyond that, it's all "plug-ins" as I described before.  Feats, powers, skills, items, etc.  I myself might include the entirety of the skill chapter in that list, just so one knows what each skill is responsible for.  Conveniently, this would bring the page total up to 50 (14 pages for skills, instead of 2).  This should be enough for system competence.  Yes, it's a lot, especially compared to what we're used to here, but it's a far cry from a scientific textbook.<br/><br/>System mastery, of course, is a whole different ballgame, and does involve knowing as much as possible about all the different plug-ins, so as to create your character optimally, and to work optimally with your fellow PCs.  Of course, the comparison to a CCG still stands: you can play the game with the core rules and whatever cards you have on hand, but to play optimally, you need to know all the available cards in your environment (cards you might use, and cards your opponents might use), as well as have an understanding of strategies and tactics that only experience can grant you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229499">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229499/#Comment_229499" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T00:46:15+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 12:46AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 1:02AM by Eric.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Nice work. 50 pages is still daunting for a new player, and I know a lot of people who would not read that many regardless of their excitement level, but it's a far cry from handing someone a PHB and saying, 'go through this.'<br/><br/>Now, with that in place, let's turn back to rules competence versus rules mastery. My textbook example also dealt with mastery more than simple competence. Note that my example about the textbook compared "learning 4E front-to-back" to a similar mastery of electrodynamics. Not just the basics, since then I'd need to compare 4E basics to the basics of electrodynamics (which fits into a small portion of a freshman text). You already mentioned that system mastery being a whole different ballgame. Since Graham mentioned rules mastery specifically, I'd like to keep the focus on that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: veritascitor</cite>I hate to be making this comparison, but it's a lot like playing a CCG (e.g. Magic: the Gathering).  The rules on "how to play" are relatively short and simple, and comprise a small subset of all the rules in the game, but the rest are contained on the individual cards, and you do not need to know what every single card in the game does in order to play successfully.<br/><br/>You're highly exaggerating the amount of rules involved, especially when comparing to previous editions.  For example, what Bryant has quoted above, and this quote from another thread:</blockquote>\nSo, let's talk about 'play successfully.' One of my part-time jobs in High School was winning local Magic tournaments (we're talking local game shop stuff, here, nothing big). To me, playing successfully meant taking home a cash purse (yeah, cash - this was back in the day). This is in sharp contrast to a friendly home game, where playing successfully might simply mean following basic procedures and taking your turn properly. Playing successfully at the tournament level typically requires knowing what every card does <i>as a prerequisite</i>. You also have to know what the popular decks are that you can make out of those cards, the relative strength of the decks, their popularity of in the metagame, specific counters, card-by-card deck compositions of recent tournament winners, and a lot more. Knowing that the most popular internet version of the deck you're facing has 2 copies of a card vs. 3 or 4 might win you the finals - or cost you, if you didn't do your homework. I've seen it and experienced both sides of it. That's rules mastery versus rules competence. (edit: veritascitor's above post now features a similar statement)<br/><br/>We seem to be agreed on this: you note that system mastery "...does involve knowing as much as possible about all the different plug-ins, so as to create your character optimally, and to work optimally with your fellow PCs." Graham posits that differences in rules mastery might be unduly punishing, and potentially put too much power in the GM's hands. So, let's unpack 4E rules mastery in a bit more detail for clarity.<br/><br/>We're talking rules mastery here, so yes to do need to know every classes powers - for initial class selection, party optimization, multiclassing, and so forth. You do need to know all the feats - how else are you going to pick the best ones? You do need to know the basic features of every creatures entire MM - how else are you going to know why Poison and Necrotic damage types are unreliable while Psychic and Radiant are good? (edit: or why a pure elf ranger party rocks so hard). You need to know what having and 18 vs. a 20 in your attack stat means for you in the long run. You need to understand why feat retraining doesn't actually let you change your character's focus in many cases (like changing an orb wizard into a staff wizard). <br/><br/>This is rules mastery we're talking about, not just being able to play the game competently. It's the difference between a 35-round grind versus Orcus at level 29 (default party and rules competence) versus soloing him at level 6 (rules mastery). And that big a differential says a lot about Graham's concerns regarding rules mastery. You may say that a player could just look this stuff up online, but that's a question of how you master the rules, not whether or not rules mastery is a big advantage. <br/><br/>That 50 page roundup looks like a good start for improving 4E pedagogy. Adam's list of key points can be synced up with it - 'for more on this, check out pages XX through YY.' But how do we go from there to mastery? After we get a new player like Graham laced up and onto the field, how do we then level that playing field (edit: and keep the game feeling fair)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso" title="MikeRiverso"><img alt="MikeRiverso" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/825/n647RY8THQBOA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRiverso">MikeRiverso</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229503/#Comment_229503" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T01:21:29+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  1:21AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 2, 2009 1:34AM by MikeRiverso.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, the confusion over competence vs. mastery came from Graham's first attempt at playing, which was definitely about competency, to his later disappointment at the "necessity" for reading up on the details.  Anywho, that's not really the issue now.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eric</cite>After we get a new player like Graham onto the field, how do we then level that playing field?</blockquote>\nThat's a damned good question, and I wish I had an answer beyond "investment and experience."  Anything else beyond that would be a matter of changing the whole game to a rules-lite system, where everything is covered by the basic rules and there are no "plug-ins."  Of course, that's just changing the situation.<br/><br/>It brings up an interesting tangent, however: we're talking about D&amp;D almost as if it were some sort of competitive environment, akin to a CCG gaming environment.  My initial instinct is to dispute this idea; that the GM isn't playing to win, etc.  However, in a game like D&amp;D, the GM does want his monsters to be a threat, and thus has some desire to see them win.  Hrm.  Anywho, that's just me rambling.<br/><br/>Another rambling thought, re: competency vs. mastery.  The question is, which one is necessary in order to have fun?  I'd argue that mastery isn't required at all, and in some ways isn't even desirable.  Too much thought about what makes the best character is often no fun.  I find myself thinking of Pun-Pun, the kobold build in D&amp;D 3.5 who, upon obtaining level 5, became the most powerful creature in the universe, literally having infinite stats and access to every single possible creature or player ability in the game.  Fun to think about, but I would never want to play him.  In 4E, I don't want to be able to solo Orcus in a few rounds.  I'd rather just come up with a neat character, pick some powers that sound kinda neat and fit my concept, perhaps reflavour to taste, and have some fun killing monsters and taking their stuff.<br/><br/>Oh, why not.  A third rambling thought: even the GM doesn't need to know everything about all the "plug-ins".  I know that when I've GM'd 4E, I never bothered learning the intricacies of the PC's abilities.  My players would tell me what their powers did when they used them.  I was just responsible for knowing what the monsters could do.  This might be an effect of the balancing efforts that WotC has put into 4E, however.  I never need to worry about making sure my Big Bad Evil Guy is immune to a particular insta-kill combo that the party wizard might have figured out.  (Yes, I know there are a few broken combos in 4E, but I've never played with players who would abuse them.  See above re: fun, and competency vs. mastery).  So, if I know more about how my particular set of monsters work, and you know more about how your PC works, which one of us is really at an advantage?<br/><br/>Edit: Come to think of it, I'm beginning to think that the issue of one player (PC or GM) having an advantage over the others is only really an issue when the players actually care about mastery in the first place.  If you're content to just pick up the game and play, no one's really going to know/care if Bob has read the PHB2 and Sally hasn't.  This is especially true if trust the design of 4E and it's balanced approach: I've often heard it said that not only is it harder to make over-powered characters in 4E, but it's also much harder to make underpowered characters.  You can pick any set of powers and feats and still be a viable character; there are no "trap choices" that make you useless.  Hrm.  Again, this is all late-night rambling, but I guess what I'm getting at is this: the inherent balance of 4E, as well as the unified mechanics, makes mastery pretty much unimportant.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229505/#Comment_229505" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T01:51:09+00:00" title="September  2, 2009  1:51AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand!<br/><br/>That's a nice distinction.

In past versions, it felt easier to drift between character interaction and combat because you didn't need to use miniatures. You could have two guys talking, one would take a swing at the other, and then go back to talking. <br><br>In 4E, there is a feeling you need to bring out the grid and minis to use any of your character's abilities. <br><br>This also leads to a lot of meta-gaming, which goes back to Graham's posts about learning the rules versus knowing the rules. When you enter a combat situation, your brain shifts into a tactical mode, so you are concentrating on that grid in front of you, almost like any turn-based strategy game. It's fun, but a different kind of fun, and the more you know and understand the rules, the more options you feel you have.<br><br>I have no idea how to deal with this disconnect, but I am feeling it more and more.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229609/#Comment_229609" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-02T10:00:21+00:00" title="September  2, 2009 10:00AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The basics of D&amp;D 4E are in the <a href="http://www.wizards.com/dnd/files/QuickStartRules.pdf" rel="nofollow">Quick Start Rules PDF</a>, which is a free download. This is the ruleset that was included in the introductory module, H1 Keep on the Shadowfell. It's 27 pages, but only 15 pages are rules. The rest of the pages are pregenerated characters.<br/><br/>Much of those rules are "rules by exception," too, meaning you can skim them and look them up when you need to. For example, skim the cover and concealment rules, all of the Conditions section, the Other Actions in Combat section, the temporary hit points rules, and the Skills section. Skim them, don't skip them. You can look this stuff up later when it applies to something you care about, but you have to know it exists. You should know what you can do, but you don't need to know what to roll to do it if you don't mind your DM or another player telling you. There are two pages of rules for monsters for the DM; a player doesn't really need to know this stuff.<br/><br/>So about 13 pages you need to read or skim. You can skim probably 6-7 of those pages. Learn those other 6-7 pages, skim the other 6-7, look up your specific powers and skills and understand what they mean, and you're off to the races.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229843">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229843/#Comment_229843" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T10:33:23+00:00" title="September  3, 2009 10:33AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main problem with that game is that it was a playtest of an adventure, and not an introduction to D&amp;D 4e. If it had been my adventure, I would have tailored it to the right balance of roleplaying and combat for the group. You can't screw with an adventure you are testing, though. Plus, in the next game, Graham's character saved all of the other characters. It was rather good. He was our hero.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, Graham did say "I am in a funny mood. I am not sure if I will enjoy this session." before the game. That never bodes well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that D&amp;D 4e requires a massive amount of rules knowledge to be really enjoyable compared with many other games, because tactical decisions informed by the rules are so important. Then the shared tactics begin to work, and the game speeds along nicely, with everyone ready to do their next action.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229865/#Comment_229865" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T11:59:15+00:00" title="September  3, 2009 11:59AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know.  I'm not really seeing this "huge amount of knowledge needed" aspect of 4E.<br/>\n<br/>\nI fully believe that players with a hugue amount of knowledge (i.e. a higher order of mastery) will defeat opponents quicker, easier and with fewer lost resources.  And that this level of mastery can mean the difference between beating the boss and TPK.  But in general.  There's not a whole lot you need to know to just play.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't get to play 4E nearly as often as I'd like to but I played through several encounters at GoPlayNW using the Dungeon Construction kit...which is basically a zero-story random encounter generator to allow you to focus on killing things and taking their stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\nI had 6 or 8 powers, 2-3 were the at wills.  What they did was on the card.  At Will cards I use all the time, Encounter Powers I can do once per fight.  Dailies...pretty much one time period for practical con purposes.  I get a move action, a fight action, and a minor action.  The minor action you don't have to worry about unless you have something you can do as a minor action...which really just means you can do it AND do a real action.  Sure there are lots of nuances and potential stuff...but really...what more do you need to know about actions and powers than that to get started.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy card tells me exactly what to do:  I roll a d20, I add 7 vs opponents AC (or Reflex or whatever that power uses).  If I hit I do [W}+6 i.e. Weapon Damage +6.  I have my two weapons listed on my sheet with what damage they do.  I may not know how those numbers got there...but I didn't make the character and I won't be leveling him up today...so why do I care how the numbers got there.  I'll just roll what it tells me to roll.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe more powerful stuff had more text on it, but each power was pretty self contained.  Some of the powers had key words like Weakness or Daze.  I didn't know exactly what those did, but I knew they'd put some kind of restriction on the baddy I hit and that somewhere was a list that described exactly what those were.  I got permission to crack the rule book, found the big list...I only needed to know the details on the 2 I could cause and the 1 that I got nailed with.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther than that you got, what:  Flanking to get Combat Advantage, Bloodied, and Healing Surges / Second Wind.<br/>\nFlanking means you get a +2 if you're on opposite sides of a figure.  Bloodied means 1/2 HPs or less, and the HPs you get back from a Healing Surge (and the number you have) are on your sheet...you can use 1 as a Second Wind pretty much whenever you want but the others can only be used if they're triggered by a power (like a healing spell or the like).<br/>\n<br/>\nI mean, if you're just handing me a character sheet and dropping me into a fight...what more do I really need to know?  Anything not written on my power cards takes what, 1 page of bullet points tops.  I'm not really seeing where that amount of knowledge is all that massive.  And that's more than enough to play and participate as a low level character just getting started.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, longer term campaign play I'd want to know what the rest of my party could do and what cool synergy effects we could get and what kind of nasty effects typical monsters we'd be facing could throw at us and how our team could best deal with that.  But all of that can be learned "on the job" and leave the obsessive compulsive pouring over the rules looking for every opitmizable bit to the people who groove on that.<br/>\n<br/>\n4E definitely rewards system mastery...but it also definitely doesn't require it.  It plays just fine at the Beer and Pretzels level...because that's the only level I've had the opportunity to play it at...and it played just fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229876/#Comment_229876" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T12:32:35+00:00" title="September  3, 2009 12:32PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do want to say that the character sheet seems needlessly daunting and distracts from the important stuff.

He picked a pre-gen rather than bringing his own character, and when it came around to his turn he'd be like:<br/><br/>"Okay, so what can I do. Oh, move here? Okay. And then I hit this guy? (roll) Do I hit? What do you mean, which power do I use? I don't know. This one? Oh, that's no good here, huh? Well, how about this one then? Alright. So do I do damage? Okay. (roll) Oh, wrong die? Okay, this one? So, okay, 5 damage? Oh, plus my Strength modifier? Alright, 7. Oh, describe what happens? I guess I hit him with my sword."<br/><br/>When he whiffed, it was worse - it was all sighing and huffing and complaints. Also, annoyance at the concept of hit points and the lack of hit locations. No attempts at tactical movement or optimal action choices. No asking the rest of the group for honest assistance, either. The game really sucked hard for him and he didn't participate in the continuation of the game.<br/><br/>Another player was the polar opposite. He had done a lot of prior reading, constructed a balanced character, and focused really hard on the tactics of the game. He made a lot of suggestions to other players, sometimes without being prompted to do so. He eventually took over DMing from me and seemed to enjoy DMing even more than playing (it gave him even more possibilities for system exploration and tactical play).<br/><br/>One other player latched on to the narrative elements of the game and really enjoyed combat descriptions, and subsequently the character-motivating story elements. He really enjoyed one session we ran which was entirely framed in a skill challenge, allowing him to author large swaths of story for each dice roll made.<br/><br/>Another built characters he really liked and reveled in the effectiveness and heroism of them. The carrot wasn't exactly the min-maxing itself, it was the payoff of the min-maxing in game when his character could land the killing blow or save another from certain death.<br/><br/>In short, I think D&amp;D 4E holds a lot of potential appeal for a lot of different types of play styles, much like earlier versions of the game, but there is a core requirement of being at least marginally interested in the tactical combat and character optimization aspects. While I do believe it's possible to come to a session unprepared and learn as you play, buy-in in the form of excitement and prior knowledge make any RPG much better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229897">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling" title="Maltese_Changeling"><img alt="Maltese_Changeling" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maltese_Changeling">Maltese_Changeling</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229897/#Comment_229897" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T13:40:34+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  1:40PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I successfully taught 4E to a group of 6 and 7 year olds who had never played an RPG in their lives (as well as a dad who had never played before).  I did make use of a simplified character sheet/play mat I found on the web, and I used red heart-shaped tokens to represent hit point totals, purple heart-shaped tokens to represent healing surges, and yellow tokens to represent action points.  When the characters took damage, the boys removed that many HP tokens.  When they healed, they removed that many healing surge tokens.  They had the DDI power cards as well.<br/><br/>I did not bother to explain conditions or the various combat actions in advance; those I handled as they came up in play.  Aside from explaining the dice types, the basic d20 mechanic, the at-will/encounter/daily distinction, and the standard/move/minor action rule, I just threw the boys into the game.  They loved it.<br/><br/>So I'm not seeing system mastery as a requirement for basic play.  More effective play, yes.  But the game is very, very forgiving.  For the first 2 levels of my dragonborn warlord's life, I ran him with a 16 STR.  The char-op boards at WotC call that suicidal, but he survived just fine to 3rd level (at which point, now having several months of play experience under my belt, I did go ahead and tweak his stats for a higher hit chance).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_229927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/algi" title="algi"><img alt="algi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/algi">algi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229927/#Comment_229927" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T17:31:10+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  5:31PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know, this isn't constructive, but this happens to me every time that I play a new RPG which wasn't explained to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_229953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/229953/#Comment_229953" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-03T21:51:59+00:00" title="September  3, 2009  9:51PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Additional factors:<br/>- length of time between turns<br/>- whiffing<br/><br/>If you\u2019re playing a tactical game with 6 players, you may be looking at 2-3 minutes per turn.

The multiple 50+ person tournaments my friends have run where they actually had to time everyone and no roleplaying was alowed took longer than 30 seconds. I've even been to a few games where the DM would restrict turns to 1 minute each but then gave up because everyone was going over. There is a reason it's a pretty common complaint on En World and the various D&amp;D blogs that they can't get more than 1-2 encounters done in 3 hours. <br/><br/>Maybe we mean something different by turns? To be clear, I mean:<br/><br/>- it's someone's turn<br/>- they overview their status effects (if they are taking ongoing damage, they mark down their hit points now)<br/>- they might ask the GM to describe or clarify something<br/>- they might ask the other players if they need something (healing, flanking...)<br/>- they use a minor action<br/>- they move<br/>- they calculate situational modifiers <br/>- they attack (and often roll damage at the same time to make things quicker)<br/>- DM says if they hit<br/>- they state how much damage they do and the DM marks it down<br/>- they roleplay, describing a quick bit of color<br/>- they sometimes use an action point<br/>- they make their saves<br/><br/>This doesn't include any rules questions or hesitation to consider tactical options.<br/><br/>The average D&amp;D players with power cards can not do all of the above in 30 seconds on an average turn (some turns, definitely). I know some people can do this. But I think they are in the minority.<br/><br/>But what about roleplaying? If a turn lasts 30 seconds to do all of the above, how long does their roleplaying last when they are describing their attacks within that 30 seconds?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryant" title="Bryant"><img alt="Bryant" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryant">Bryant</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230008/#Comment_230008" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T06:49:21+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  6:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think 30 seconds per turn is realistic, particularly in an LFR/RPGA environment.

Of the 6, one had played a bit of 3e, one had played a bit of white box with his dad, and the rest had no experience.<br/>Started with Keep on the Shadowfell (which starts out with a fight right away).<br/><br/>Here's what I started them with initially:\n<ul>\n<li>Core mechanic (1d20 + stuff on sheet + stuff from situation) vs. Target</li>\n<li>That if they tried something that wasn't on the card, to say what they wanted, and we'd figure it out (charging, bull rushes, etc don't need to be introduced right away)</li>\n<li>Initiative</li>\n<li>Actions (Move/Standard/Minor)</li>\n<li>Powers (At-Will/Encounter/Daily) + how to read a power card</li>\n<li>When a player's turn came up, at first, I explained the basics of the role. (marking, healing, combat advantage)</li>\n<li>Pointing out flanking opportunities (at first)</li>\n<li>When they stared at their cards, trying to decide, I have a handful of tips, mostly how power A is different from power B (reading power cards revisited)</li>\n</ul>\nIt was pretty slow going at first, because we were all learning together. I didn't time anyone, but I tried to push things along best I could.<br/><br/>I also was learning the tactical game myself (which I think is complex, if the goal is to master it). I think that unless you're playing competitively (player vs. dm), all that matters is that everyone is close enough (I'm a fair chess player, some people I can beat consistently, but anyone serious will mop the floor with me, it's most fun, and you learn best to play with people at about your 'level').<br/><br/>First session, I ran the monsters sub-optimally, mostly to contrive examples.<br/>Second session, I ran them normally, and the players did really well against them.<br/>Third session, I had to study and come up with better tactics (I could have also added monsters to the encounters, effectively 'handicapping' the players.<br/>From there on out, I wasn't amazing, they weren't amazing, but we kept pace with each other pretty well.<br/><br/>The thing I found to be most important in teaching new players is to have the character match what the player wants to do. One of my (many) mistakes teaching this group was forgetting that a Human Fighter is as complex as an Eladrin Wizard in 4E, the fighter can't just say "I hit him with my greatsword" like in previous editions. Also, the fighter's job in 4e is to get hit. A player who doesn't want to have a target painted on her chest shouldn't be a fighter, at least at first. It's not fun for them. In later sessions, this player created a cleric, which she loved playing.<br/><br/>I guess my point is, I don't think that study of the books is necessary. I do think that there is a learning curve, and to get to the 3 encounters = 4 hours of play standard, one needs system competence, and possibly mastery of their character. I also think that the "What you need to know to play" could be summed up in 2 pages (with a big asterisk that one can do other things not listed on those 2 pages)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230015">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230015/#Comment_230015" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T07:47:48+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  7:47AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't watched any other groups play and I've never seen an RPGA session in any edition of D&amp;D, so I only have the two groups I play in as reference, both groups I've played with a long time.  I guess we don't take the tactical elements as seriously as those guys.  There is one guy that often takes more than a minute, but that is balanced out by a lot of 20 second turns.  The DM turn does typically take a couple minutes.  Another factor is that we haven't seen Paragon play yet.  Soon!<br/><br/>I wasn't counting roleplaying, just the moving and rolling your attack and damage dice together, which honestly usually takes about ten to twenty seconds.  The roleplaying does add more time, but that's time I don't mind, and I don't think of it as just that player's turn.  That's the period where we all look up from the table and engage one another, regardless of whose turn it is.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I've read all those ENworld threads and participated in some of them, asking questions to try to understand what's making things move so glacially.  We typically only have one or two combats a five hour session but only because we want the rest to be pure roleplaying.  But when we decided to try a module just to gain proficiency with the combat rules, we went through Scepter Tower of Spellguard at 4 encounters (once even 5!) per 5-6 hour session night.  We had four Strikers and a Leader which also helped keep things short and deadly.<br/><br/>I do agree the combats take too long for my tastes.  So... my house rules.<br/><br/>All more evidence, I guess, that people can't talk really talk about D&amp;D because they're not playing the same game in a lot of ways.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_230040">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230040/#Comment_230040" name="Item_61" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T08:45:57+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  8:45AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Let's voluntarily fork the whole idea of how to make the game faster over to a <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10347&amp;page=1#Item_1" rel="nofollow">new thread</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phargle" title="phargle"><img alt="phargle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phargle">phargle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/230041/#Comment_230041" name="Item_62" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-04T08:50:42+00:00" title="September  4, 2009  8:50AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Among the various people I've introduced to 4E, I've noticed a common theme:  when they first play, they make decisions in combat very, very, very slowly.
