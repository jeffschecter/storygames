Do I presume to much in this definition?<br/><br/>Personally, I've always been turned off by generic games, always allowing a specific setting to grab my imagination and guide my enthusiasm for a certain game. I was made aware of Archipelago II (and the Norwegian Style blog) after reading J. Morningstar's <i>Last Train Out of Warsaw</i> and, while I appreciate the workmanship of Archipelago, I wouldn't be quite so admiring of it had Last Train not revealed its potential to me. Interestingly, however, it's a huge subversion - while Archipelago II is generic and thus leaves great potential for creation, Last Train doesn't even allow you to create the character you play (not to say this is at all a negative thing). <br/><br/>Conan, what is best in life? Potential for invention, or narrative focus? Or?<br/><br/>Finally: The chance to author a setting and characters from the ground up in a sandbox situation is one thing but it strikes me that a system which furnishes a group with the means to enact any story they can devise, should perhaps, in addition to the means of conflict resolution, offer formal structure? <br/><br/>I'm aware Archipelago II isn't the only game of its type, it just made for an easy example. I hope this piques your interest.<br/><br/>-Mike.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249443/#Comment_249443" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-03T14:07:11+00:00" title="January  3, 2010  2:07PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What sorts of formal structure were you thinking of Mike?<br/><br/>Archipelago definitely has some structure that's easy to miss, especially until you take into account the role of players as "canon keepers" over certain specific areas, the use of destiny points created by other players (yet the specific destiny point used chosen by the owner of the character), and the co-creation of the setting.<br/><br/>What's interesting to me is the way that re-interpreting the concepts of "islands" and "ocean" can make Archipelago into a much different sort of game than it was originally designed as by Matthjis. The first game of it I played re-interepreted the set up to create an astroid belt setting, but you could very easily take it further, making the "ocean" High School and the "islands" social cliques, for example. I'd also done a bit of pondering regarding hacking it for a WW2 resistance game, with the the islands becoming cells or factions rather than literal geographic areas.<br/><br/>Uniersalis is another very open-ended storygame you might want to look into. It has a scene structure and resource economy built into it, as well as group situation/world creation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249446">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin" title="Potemkin"><img alt="Potemkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/114/nF8WSGYEOD82Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Potemkin">Potemkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249446/#Comment_249446" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-03T14:56:12+00:00" title="January  3, 2010  2:56PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Komrade, the sorts of formal structure that encourage focused story telling. The "keepers" in Archipelago are certainly as example of this - disagreements as to certain aspects of play are avoided by giving each player control over a setting element, enabling concise gameplay via swift policy-making. Fates are another example: players are made aware of where to direct a scene as one in a series; the narrative goal for which they strive. Without either, I feel Archipelago play would slow and meander confusingly. <br/><br/>I like the idea of interpreting the islands politically.

However, we all realize these are games that prejudice a pre-defined description of player character capabilities, and leave narrative, plot, and pacing concerns to the GM's discretion. Since these games are all very popular, I assume you weren't talking about them, but instead about games where the rules directly address the flow of the narrative and/or prejudice player authorship without providing much in the way of mandatory fiction?<br/><br/>Universalis and F# were already mentioned. There's also a less-stripped-down version of FATE, called FATE 2.0.<br/><br/>There's also Primetime Adventures and the Solar System rules (the generic version of Shadow of Yesterday). Other than Fate, they are probably the most well-known "generic story-games."<br/><br/>Many games are generic except for a general conceit (that is still more specific than "tv show"): Dread is generic, but always horror. Mortal Coil is generic, as long as there is magic. Best Friends is generic as long as you play girlfriends. Diaspora is generic hard sci-fi.

In my mind (and probably only in my mind) a story game is distinct from a more traditional roleplaying game in that the primary objective of play is the collaborative creation of a narrative by the players and a tacit knowledge of this objective by the same. While it can be successfully argued that all roleplaying games might, by definition, be included in this interpretation I believe there is a clear distinction demarked by design-intention and player-practice. <br/><br/>... please don't kill me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249497/#Comment_249497" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-04T02:00:51+00:00" title="January  4, 2010  2:00AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are people really confused about what someone means by "story games" when they use that word, especially with adequate context?<br/>Really?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249500/#Comment_249500" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-04T03:23:43+00:00" title="January  4, 2010  3:23AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Potemkin</cite>... please don't kill me.</blockquote>\nCool, Mike.

LeGuin's <em>Earthsea</em> books. I wanted a game of grand destinies, that at the same time had time to dwell on the details of plants, words, everyday lives."<br/><br/>Granted, you can come up with any any setting you like, but the rules of the game trend any story you tell with it in a certain direction. I'd say Matthijs succeeded; it really seems to focus on stories about characters who have a destiny, and push towards that destiny, consciously or otherwise.<br/><br/>"But Jason," I hear you say, (oh hypothetical reader), "doesn't that really describe <em>all</em> stories? The destiny mechanic could mean as little as where your character ends up; its use merely keeps the story from wandering too much, so you build towards some conclusion." To which I respond with a challenge: would <em>Archipelago</em> work to play a game based on Camus' <em>The Stranger</em>?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249591">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans" title="Tanya Fyans"><img alt="Tanya Fyans" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tanya%20Fyans">Tanya Fyans</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249591/#Comment_249591" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-04T16:23:36+00:00" title="January  4, 2010  4:23PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are pleanty of games where you could just take the mechanical engine and it would meet your requirements.

You can use them to run most any premise in which a group of "set apart" characters travel between various places trying to make things better... and that's covers 90% of the content of most roleplaying games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_249698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249698/#Comment_249698" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T11:57:47+00:00" title="January  5, 2010 11:57AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 5, 2010 11:58AM by Sam!.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: LaughingJackWilton</cite>Wushu is a great generic story game.

A lot of times I see scenarios \u2014 like a <i>Transformers</i> game in another thread \u2014 where <i>Wushu</i> would be the perfect fit without any modification needed at all.  I agree that it's not well-suited to a long campaign, but it's just the thing for scenarios that don't call for a lot of crunch but plenty of narrative freedom.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_249727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton" title="LaughingJackWilton"><img alt="LaughingJackWilton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/LaughingJackWilton">LaughingJackWilton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/249727/#Comment_249727" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-05T13:42:45+00:00" title="January  5, 2010  1:42PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wushu is great for that sort of game. It is also good for games where you need a warm up before the game starts. Have a running game that is played while you are waiting for everyone to get there and be settled. It doesn't have to make sense, but it gets everyone going.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
