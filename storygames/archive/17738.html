(If we weren't playing Fiasco or Our Last Best Hope, we were just as likely to be watching a movie or wondering what happened to Val Kilmer.) The three of them have been friends for ages - at least a decade, maybe? - and I've come into the group in the last three or four years.<br/><br/>Recently, the three other friends had a huge fight about some pretty major stuff, and the ultimate outcome was that two of them are no longer speaking to the third and vice versa, and I have no reason to believe that's going to change any time soon. That's been awkward for a whole lot of reasons, as I'm sure you can guess, but one of the downsides that I hadn't thought about is that I kind of have no-one to game with now. I don't really want to invite just the one or just the two back to play - I'm not taking sides in any of this, and they're all good friends - but having them at the same table isn't an option either.<br/><br/>This sort of thing must have happened to other people, for whatever reason. What happened? What did you do? Did you solve it? Am I ever going to get to play Monsterhearts?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401533/#Comment_401533" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-22T08:03:52+00:00" title="December 22, 2012  8:03AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Fred is still in prison, so it's a moot point.  <br/><br/>Um, have you considered Skype gaming?

(I'd rather not game at all than game with people I'm not friends or at least friend-of-friends with, so I draw the line here. YMMV, though.)<br/><br/>Unless the argument was specifically about gaming, it's probably okay to play a game with whichever of them want to join you without it being a signal that you've taken sides in this mess. Especially if you make it clear that you just want to play a game, not take sides. At least, that's how it's supposed to work; people obviously get weird/defensive/petty when they've just had a major falling-out with an old friend, and if you know that someone's going to have hurt feelings about you rolling dice on a Saturday with THAT AWFUL PERSON, so much for your neutrality.<br/><br/>You're in a better position to judge whether you can keep gaming with part of your old group without creating unwanted real-life drama, so figure that out and proceed from there. If that's not going to happen, then go see if your other, non-gaming friends (new or old ones) will give it a whirl: we've had plenty of threads here about good ways to introduce people to RPGs, some of that advice has got to be useful, right? <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401538/#Comment_401538" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-22T09:17:20+00:00" title="December 22, 2012  9:17AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I pretty much never play more than a single campaign with the same group of people anymore.

(This of course only goes for friends - if you're gaming with mere acquaintances, then that's different.) If I truly had no opinion and just wanted to have some friends to game with, I would inform both parties of the forthcoming play date, let them know that I've told both about it, and if necessary, talk it out to find out which of the exclusive parties would like to get into the game in question more, so that the other party can not make an appearance (not because I don't want them, but because they don't want to come if the other party is coming). Over a longer time-frame I might skip asking both and instead just ask the friends I thought might enjoy the game most, while making sure to socialize with all my friends appropriately. I could theoretically keep this up until I didn't want to play with these people anymore, or they forgave each other.<br/><br/>The above is pretty much how adults seem to handle this sort of thing in European social circles (as opposed to nerd subculture), by the way: if you have friends that can't stand each other, you just don't invite them to the same get-together as a common courtesy. If you are confident in your relationships with them, you can openly talk about it and tell friend A that he shouldn't come to event X because friend B is going to come, and it makes more sense to have B there than A because B is the celebrant's cousin, or whatever. When both parties start to get annoyed about missing all the best parties, then you get to try peacemaking.<br/><br/>When something like this happened to me over a decade ago, I pretty much just got new friends to play with, while maintaining relationships with the various parties according to my pleasure. A large facet of that particular case was that my friends were mostly either casual gamers or more interested in e.g. miniatures gaming, so it was easier for all of us to just stop playing together.

Only downside is I've been running for the group non-stop for a decade now as no-one else will do it...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401660/#Comment_401660" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-24T12:37:42+00:00" title="December 24, 2012 12:37PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sometimes time can heal wounds.

That sort of inviate can  bring out people who was gaming in the teens but quit but feel curious about coming back to the hobby, as well as people that is curious about the gaming hobby and hasn't been invited before.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401824/#Comment_401824" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-27T08:34:29+00:00" title="December 27, 2012  8:34AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I second the Meetup.com suggestion.

I think I'm going to give it another month or so, wait for the nasty inter-personal stuff to have died down and everyone to settle a bit, and then put something together with as many people as I can muster, see if I can at least get some people to buffer between the fighting two.

I stopped the game there and took a couple of months off to stave off gm burnout. After about five months I called back the rest of the group-although not his cousin who I regretted not having back-and started playing again. It was a much better group and I enjoyed the next campaign more without him.<br/><br/>Keith                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
