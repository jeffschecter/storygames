I've noticed over time that there is a big divide between extroverts and introverts - it's been very noticeable to me, at times, in story-gaming more than other RPG groups, for some reason that I don't understand. Mechanics which involve touching or, say, handing out praise, are not merely uncomfortable to introverts, they are genuinely a barrier to enjoyment that <b>will not go away</b> by just practicing it. This isn't just shyness (low self-esteem) that I'm talking about, it's an inherent part of a person's character that <i>is not a flaw</i>. It's a difference.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's easy to overlook this element, since the extroverts are the ones that do all the talking (and touching). <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nMy introverted brothers and sisters, speak out!

His muu tried to sing and I informed him that it implied him singing us a muusong (a "song" with no words). I then instructed him to stand up, walk to the wall, turn, come back to the table and sing a muusong for us. He refused. <i>I can't sing and I won't sing! No way!</i> - he said. But I made him. <i>You've agreed to play the game</i>, I said, <i>and this is how the game plays. I make no exception for you. You will sing. The "can't sing" refrain has no meaning in this game. Muus don't normally use its voice, so your singing will be exactly what a muusong is about.</i> It took 30 minutes to make him sing, but in the end he did. <br><br>And his song was received with applause and praise and embracing co-players. It was a perfect muusong. His lack of singing voice and shyness and fear for being ridiculed did not go away, but his soul took a very important leap of faith, and was rewarded.<br><br>After the game he thanked me for forcing him to sing. Why? Cause he himself had no chance overcoming his shyness, low self esteem and fear for being outed, and I really gave help where help were needed. And he thanked me cause he was met with respect and love, by me and the other players. The reception his clumsy muusong got gave him an insight in how a man can make a fool of himself and be wiser by it, and loved for it. <br><br>Not trying to convert you, Darren, but wanted you to know that you don't have to play up to your neuroses or fears or personal quirks all the time.

Try to define what is fun in roleplaying games. Be sure to include any fun we may have. ;-)<br/><br/>The fun in singing a muusong is that you don't carry the tune!

Some say that people have some traits that are inherent and can't change. If people are compelled to go against this nature they are harmed and usually feel abused.<br/>\n2. Others say that games can offer a safe and compassionate environment for people to learn how to cope/overcome/understand their nature and have fun at the same time.<br/>\n<br/>\n(1) and (2) aren't mutually inconsistent but the ones voicing (1) seem to be focusing on what can go wrong when (2) goes wrong, while the ones voicing (2) seem to be focusing on what happens when things go right.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think we should go further back and ask what is the social contract behind the games being played. (1) seems to imply that the boundaries shouldn't be crossed (unless explicitly said so?), (2) says nothing about it and we can read it as saying the opposite or even understand that the boundaries were agreed upon (i.e. "You've agreed to play the game, I said, and this is how the game plays. I make no exception for you." may indicate that the gameplay was explained before).

Extroverts want to out every single introvert and turn them into an extrovert. It's part of our nature. Introverted does not mean "shy" - there are plenty of introverted people that are very shy, and there are others that are not as shy at all. And every single person is different. We encourage extroverted behavior in Western society. <br/>\n<br/>\nSometimes it's good to break someone out of shy behavior, but you cannot break an introvert out of being an introvert. It's their nature, an intrinsic part of their personality. <br/>\n<br/>\nForcing someone do to something can be cathartic but it really doesn't always work that way. For example, my boyfriend is pretty shy, but he can be a bit of an extrovert when cajoled. It might have taken him a while, but he probably would have gotten up eventually. Maybe. I know my sister is extremely shy and reserved, as well as an introvert, and if you would have stopped the game to make her sing, she would have gotten extremely stubborn and walked away from the table in tears. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat being said, I don't have problems with high-fives and shaking hands, or perhaps even a hug, but I do value my personal space.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clyde%20L.%20Rhoer" title="Clyde L.

Introversion has nothing to do with self confidence, shyness, social skills, or touching. You can go to the party, and be a touching, flirting, funny, life of the party, and be extremely introverted. What introversion means is that you cherish more the time you spend alone, or in small groups. So after that party you go home, sit down in your computer chair, sigh, and play civilization for several hours to relax. An extrovert would find the party relaxing and the Civilization draining. So after a long Civilization game an Extrovert might go down to the local coffee house, or  pub, to hang out. An introvert finds the party draining and the Civilization (or reading, or lonely fun) relaxing.<br/><br/>Being uncomfortable with touching is something else, something else that's worthy of examination, but it's not introversion. Introversion is about choice not capability. Shyness, dislike of touching, etc. are about capability. So someone may behave like an introvert because they are shy, but shyness is about fear. That shy person could be extroverted and the shyness is a problem. I'm not shy, I'm enjoying myself with my <i>lonely</i> activities while half my city puts on red shirts and gathers in a stadium on Saturdays to yell as men in semi-armor chase around a stuffed pigskin. On the other side I enjoy going to Gen Con to talk with people who share my extreme interest in a narrow topic. I talk so much, that I only play one game each year at Gen Con. I thoroughly enjoy all this social interaction, because it is on a subject of interest, it expands my mental life. <br/><br/>Also for most people introversion and extroversion are not dramatically stronger. The desires commonly fluctuate. My understanding is it is rare to have someone like myself who tests completely introverted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis" title="Morten Greis"><img alt="Morten Greis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Morten%20Greis">Morten Greis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164739/#Comment_164739" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T09:48:38+00:00" title="August 24, 2008  9:48AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a very interesting thread. I find the use of touching in a game, that is weighted heavily towards voice and somewhat towards visual bodylanguage, can be a very strong element. <br/><br/>So when I cowrote "Kvinden, der var" (Danish scenario, download here: <a href="http://alexandria.dk/data?scenarie=3343" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://alexandria.dk/data?scenarie=3343</a>) - "The Woman that Was" we actively chose to use touching a part of the story, and the players were informed of this before the start of the game. One character, the Woman, appears in the realtime part of the scenario only as a fading memory - the character can only interact when standing behind another player, and the character can in the beginning interact using eyecontact, speech and touching, later only with speech and touching and finally as the memory recedes, it is only by touching.<br/><br/>Her touching were defined to be limited to arms and shoulders, being inspired by some Swedish live-scenarios, where they applied a technique called Ars Amandi, where arms and shoulders were treated as erogenous zones. There is an article about it here (article in English: <a href="http://www.ropecon.fi/brap/ch17.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.ropecon.fi/brap/ch17.pdf</a>).<br/><br/>So basicly I believe that most touching can be used in a responsible manner to enhance your roleplaying experience. In some caes you'll need a social contract, and in some cases you might have irresponsible players desiring to grope their fellow players - if so, then you're playing the wrong rpg-scenario or with the wrong players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164768">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164768/#Comment_164768" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T11:22:22+00:00" title="August 24, 2008 11:22AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 24, 2008 11:23AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: daniel_yokomizo</cite>I understand the emotions behind (1)</blockquote>I too understand that people don't want their boundaries crossed.

Rhoer</cite>Hey folks,<br/><br/>There's a bit of a problem with the definition in this thread. Introversion has nothing to do with self confidence, shyness, social skills, or touching. You can go to the party, and be a touching, flirting, funny, life of the party, and be extremely introverted. What introversion means is that you cherish more the time you spend alone, or in small groups. So after that party you go home, sit down in your computer chair, sigh, and play civilization for several hours to relax. An extrovert would find the party relaxing and the Civilization draining. So after a long Civilization game an Extrovert might go down to the local coffee house, or  pub, to hang out. An introvert finds the party draining and the Civilization (or reading, or lonely fun) relaxing.<br/><br/>Being uncomfortable with touching is something else, something else that's worthy of examination, but it's not introversion. Introversion is about choice not capability.</blockquote>\nI agree with much of what your said, but disagree with some of it too. For instance (and this isn't meant to be inflammatary - if I could think of another good example I would use it), that last sentence sounds to me like, "heterosexuality is a choice." Introversion (or extroversion) is not a choice.<br/>Also, some introverts can indeed go to the party, and even - for a limited time - be the life and soul of that party. But like all things, there are degrees. While introverts are not necessarily shy, they do tend to share the same issues regarding personal space - of course, where they each draw the line differs from person to person. While not all introverts have issues about touching or singing in public or whatever, it's a lot more common among them than among extroverts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_164858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164858/#Comment_164858" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T00:04:42+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 12:04AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>An "introvert" player once participated in a game of Muu, i Bergen, Norway. <br/></blockquote>\nI could similarly relate tales of how in providing an introvert friendly zone for roleplayers, I have helped introverted and shy people alike get more enjoyment out of roleplaying, and become more active participants in the games. I'm sure I've caused frustration for some extroverts too (spotlight hogs and loudmouths, mainly: fortunately, they are the extreme end of extroversion and not the norm). It may be that your sensitivity is such that you can tell when the technique you used above is a good thing for a person. I also think that the kind of events you are talking about here - LARPS without no touching rules - won't attract many introverts. So the people that turn up are more predisposed to participate in that kind of situation, or allow themselves to be cajoled into it and gain some kind of enjoyment from it.<br/>The main reason I posted was because Jason was talking about using such techniques in table-top games, and that really did smake me shudder <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I didn't want to derail his thread, though, since I support such games being developed.

This is because (a) it's out of their comfort zone, and (b) it's unfamiliar - and they don't have the skills, yet, to cope with it. That (b) is obviously true of extroverts too, but they are more generallyt experienced socially, and their nature is to feed off the reactions of others (vampires!), so they thrive more easily.<br/>\nThere's also (c) - the introvert really doesn't want to be doing those things. It's <i>unnatural!</i><br/>\nSo, when it's necessary - like it's important for a job - an introvert could act like an extrovert: gladhanding, being a salesman, public speaking, that sort of thing. But they'll never be truly comfortable at it, and when seeking fun activities, they'll probably want a break from all that. It's just not fun.<br/>\n<br/>\nSome introverts might well use roleplaying games as a safe haven to train some social skills that are more familiar to extroverts (who've been enthusiastically practicing them all their lives, while introverts have been avoiding them). I have done that, for example. So I'm not arguing that there's a completely binary split between extroverts and introverts.<br/>\nBut I do think that on balance, most will be seeking escapist fun, and probably (really badly) want to avoid having to behave like an extrovert.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Note: get an introvert chatting on a subject he feels passionate about, and he can sometimes become just as much of a blabbermouth as the typical extrovert.

Shy children from 10-15 generally experience a benign effect of playing RPGs regularly. It makes them more sure of themselves and their ability to voice their opinions. Some of "my children" have grown from silent backbenchers to opinion-makers in their classroom within a year of roleplaying.<br><br>My method for doing this is simple: be a good GM that takes care of all the players, ensuring that each and every one of them has to participate actively in the gameplay. The tendency of some children to shy back from real participation in an interactive game is not healthy. If they apply the same attitude to real life they got a problem. So out of consideration for both them and the game I make them INTERACT in my games.<br><br>This principle of participation is true for shy adults too. They are not very different from shy children. <i>To play without participating</i> is not a defensible position in roleplaying games.

And that's fine, that's exactly how it should be done.  (And if that's not how it was done in this case, well...then Tomas was very lucky that it worked out okay despite that.)<br/><br/>Of course, ideally, you should always tell everyone -- introverted and extroverted alike -- what to expect ahead of time.  That's just good manners.  It just turns out that introverts in particular really get a lot of benefit out of advance warning.<br/><br/><br/>Other things that make strange new experiences easier on introverts include limiting the group to people they already know and have already hung around with, and keeping the group size below their stressful threshold.

With the latter I'd consider it hubris of highest order if somebody came to tell me what is good for me <i>in the guise of gamemastering</i>. Sure, do tell me what I need to do if I want to play your game, but taking that as an excuse to play in kitchen psychiatry seems wrong-headed to me. You shouldn't discuss the question of "whether this is something you should do" when the real question is "whether you want to play this game at all".<br/><br/>Which is just another form of saying that I don't really see it as an obvious fact that getting good results from a personal intervention in somebody else's social foibles is enough to justify such. (And really, what sort of results are you going to get when you talk somebody into singing against extreme reluctance? That story would have been outright weird if somebody at the table would have <i>ridiculed</i> the guy after putting so much energy into making him vulnerable like that.) Roleplayers are really weird about the authority role of the GM, and if I saw somebody using that role to pressurize another player to do something they weren't expecting to do in a game... bullying is a pretty good word, actually, whether the results were good or not. The player goes into this social situation where they'll be branded as a "bad player" if they get out of it, or are otherwise reluctant to be the first to walk away, all the while thinking that <i>it's their own fault</i> if they're not enlightened enough to be good players and follow along with whatever the GM has devised for them. Taking such an opportunity as a GM to pressure somebody into doing anything... tricky, I'd be very careful in that position.<br/><br/>So I guess my contribution is this: the fact that rpg history bestows upon you, o GM, great authority, does not in any way justify exercising that power. The fact that you get good results out of it does not justify treating other people as an object of your authority. The only way to justify your authority is to put it into the rules of the game and defend your actions on that ground, at least insofar as we're talking of entertainment play. Consensuality means that you either get prior agreement for some activity or negotiate it in play - and this holds whether we're talking of rolling dice, singing or going out and doing little missions for your GM, as some folks have started doing in Sweden.<br/><br/>(In the interest of clearing potential biases, let it be said that I wouldn't be interested in a game that required singing as a core issue - I can't sing and that bothers me, so I'm not likely to display my incompetence in this matter in public unless the game had some major redeeming qualities to make it worth it. I'd like to believe that I'd have the courage to walk away if somebody tried to leverage my desire to be a good player into some sort of surprise display of my singing inability. Just the same as any other things other people try to force you to do, really.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_164877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164877/#Comment_164877" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T03:58:06+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  3:58AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2008 4:13AM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>I certainly hope that's what Tomas did with his non-singing guy -- that he told him up front, "Hey, in this game, the PLAYERS sing when their characters do," and that's why he knew that the guy would eventually overcome his reluctance and perform the song...because after being told this, the guy still agreed to show up and play.  And that's fine, that's exactly how it should be done.  (And if that's not how it was done in this case, well...then Tomas was very lucky that it worked out okay despite that.)</blockquote>No. I did not tell him up front what to expect of the game. No one can <i>tell you everything</i> that may happen during a game.<br/><br/>I also heartily disagree with you. The notion that we should tell the players what to expect is not feasible in the real world. In my experience it also has the opposite effect. If told a challenge will come before it actually happens, most people with ingrained insecurities will take a strong defensive stance. That stance will undermine their ability to deal with the challenge in any constructive way.<br/><br/>I do not believe in warnings. But I do believe in <i>enticing </i>the players, <i>challenging </i>them, and showing them I <i>care </i>about them.<br/><br/>I believe the principle of roleplaying games is that you take a chance by participating, and that a challenge may always arise on some personal level or other. That is one of the most important positive trappings of improvised interactive gameplay.<br/><br/>The constructive chaos that this result in, is carefully balanced by a positive stance taken by your co-players (including the GM). By taking a stance of acceptance: we will accept what you bring to the game, and support: we will not abandon you, - the players take responcibility for a positive outcome.<br/><br/><i>Mind this: by NOT accepting and supporting each other, players may very well play a dysfunctional and potentially destructive game, but that is outside the scope of this discussion.</i><br/><br/>The point of not abandoning your fellow players is very important. The principle of "not abandoning you" was at the base of my work with the non-singer. I refused to abandon him. If I had, he would have experienced a sad defeat in my game. As it turned out, our game was one of victory and hope for him, due to him being supported rather than abandoned. I believe some of you need to consider this point very carefully.<br/><br/>This discussion is an important one. For sooth: it will always be! But this thread has run its course now. I've done my part. Hope it gave you some stuff for reflection.

That is my nature. I, however, are nothing of a shy person. I had my moments in my childhood and early teens, but I have been a very confident and centered person in general.<br/><br/>I have always been an exhibitionist. I have been an actor and a dancer for as long as I can remember. I love showing off my drawings and writings. I consider myself a very physical person (I can't conceive not touching people). I most of the time like getting ahead of challenges and new experiences. I do all that because of me. I do it because it satisfies me, and I can feel better about myself. What others think or say about me bothers me not. And that is because I am introverted.<br/><br/>Sometimes I had shied away in the past. And because some people cared about me and kicked me into the spotlight, I was able to overcome those insecurities. And that did not change my introverted ways the least bit. But it allowed me to face and overcome my fears, and thus enjoy life a lot more since I was able to fully embrace my nature.<br/><br/>I have been a GM for about 10 years now. I started at it just after one of my worst shyness periods. It helped me blossom. And I have experienced dealing with all kinds of people. Shy introverted ones, confident introverted ones, shy extroverted ones, confident introverted ones...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite>So, when it's necessary - like it's important for a job - an introvert could act like an extrovert: gladhanding, being a salesman, public speaking, that sort of thing. But they'll never be truly comfortable at it, and when seeking fun activities, they'll probably want a break from all that. It's just not fun.</blockquote>\nSome of them won't. Maybe even most of them. But one thing has nothing to do with the other. Sometimes people do enjoy the chance of behaving differently, of experimenting under the guise of a game something that they'll otherwise not dare doing.<br/><br/>I believe it has more to do with fears and insecurities than with nature.<br/><br/>Now, back on topic:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite>While not all introverts have issues about touching or singing in public or whatever, it's a lot more common among them than among extroverts.</blockquote>\nAgreed. And my personal theory is that it has to do with:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Fine</cite>Extroverts want to out every single introvert and turn them into an extrovert. It's part of our nature. Introverted does not mean "shy" - there are plenty of introverted people that are very shy, and there are others that are not as shy at all. And every single person is different. We encourage extroverted behavior in Western society.</blockquote>\nSo, as far as what I have learned from my own introversion and that of others, the problem is not so much about nature than about personal history, social pressures and context.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_165007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165007/#Comment_165007" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T14:24:30+00:00" title="August 25, 2008  2:24PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite>Even<b>I</b>know that players have to sing a muu song</blockquote>They don't.

That's one of the core Social Contract elements of gaming, never to be disregarded: inform players of the NOGH/IWNA divide and where you plan to play. For instance, I knew that <i>For Mature Audiences</i> was going to be VERY difficult and painful, if played "correctly" or "to the hilt"; and so the game's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> Rule (called "The Prime Directive," to drive it home for those with Trek exposure) is I Will Not Abandon You. I even go so far as to say/write, "You WILL get hurt, to learn from that pain and the support of your fellow players."<br/><br/>I don't even go so far as to expect it to be fun.

Keep your calm.<br/><br/>I am trying to tell David that his "never to be disregarded"-rule is something most gamers haven't even heard of. So most of them really do disregard it, and have done so for forty years.<br/><br/>I do know that many of the folks here are deeply engaged in RPGs, so I could speak for them, taking the understanding of such terms for granted (even though a lot fo the people here don't understand it either). I choose to keep my perspective mixed; to educate myself while always maintaining an awareness of the people I've played with and instructed in GMing, and what they tend to find useful in their gaming. Most of them don't frequent such forums. And most of them find it refreshingly simple and <i>empowering </i>to be told that neither absolutes nor perfection has a place in roleplaying games:<br/><br/><i>- Be human, be fallible, be clumsy and show your weaknesses. Make it fun for yourself. Relax!</i><br/><br/>That is the message they most need to hear. I find a lot of the statements in this thread to be quite contrary to such sentiments.<br/><br/>The notion that any good will come from having any <i>rule or convention</i> implying that you have to tell the players how far you will go, beforehand, is far more in the direction of <i>One-True-Way</i> than I am willing to go. Davids statement is far too absolute for my taste. You may tell your players that your game will be challenging, of course, but you may also choose to give no warnings, and do so with a perfect conscience.

It seems to me that a bunch of inteliigent people are trying to say that yes this stuff (Touching Singing, Etc) are part of games, and tools to use and ways to grow and others are saying that this will alientate players (particuarly introverts) and act as a barrier to play and that this will not work for everyone (or even many). The original people get defensive , citing examples of what happened and then attempting to justify these examples  (fostering growth, helping people ) which is then labeled by the nay sayers as examples of one trueway ism. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think the moral of the story is that you have to know your audience, it may not be explicit like being buddies with someone for a long time, but I'm sure that if the muu singer had given enough negative signs Thomas would have backed off, regardless of any rule that he might have had regarding leaving no player behind, I don't think he's unreasonable. He played it by ear and it payed off. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said I think a just as likely occurance would be in the IWNAY scenarios is the player rejecting the game, I don't play therapy games, I don't play touch games, I don't need teaching or growing. I don't play these games, and if I had mistakenly found myself in such a game, I would stop playing it, in the continuim of A to ~A, o or not playing is a very valid choice, and if we all remember that , and that these are games among consenting adults etc, it seems a whole lot more reasonable. <br/>\n<br/>\nthat said a link or new post or explanation about some of this lines and viels jargon would be helpful , I kinda get the jist but am interested in knowing more. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat said I really think this comes pretty close to the reason why I don't like agenda in play ( Changing people for the better, making people better faster stronger, representing the underrepresented,etc) Quite frankly considering this thread I'm not sure I want self help from Game Designers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_166042">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166042/#Comment_166042" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-28T23:35:12+00:00" title="August 28, 2008 11:35PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 28, 2008 11:36PM by TomasHVM.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Logos! Your post is good! Full of considerate thoughts.<br/><br/>I have only one remark, to this: <i>I don't play therapy games, I don't play touch games, I don't need teaching or growing. I don't play these games,</i><br/><br/>This is, as much of the rest stated in this discussion, not quite in touch with reality. Reality is that there are no such games. There are no "therapy games". There are really no "touch games". To say you don't play "such games" is like shouting in the void.<br/><br/>However: that void may be the an empty space for creativity to grow in. I believe we may see such games coming out in the future, at least games that go further in using touch as a tool. How the landscape of RPGs will change due to such future games is not for us to say. We have to wait and see. You may be surprised 10 years from now, over what kind of games you are playing. If you are still into RPGs and all your friends are playing the latest opera-craze, then it may be that your voice will join the choir.<br/><br/>Only speculating, of course ... ;-)<br/><br/>And a comment to the introvert and shy: I am both introvert and shy. I do not like strangers touching me. I get all stiff and strange by it. I even have troubles with my wife touching me. This is a part of me, but I am careful not to define my whole self from this quirk. I'd rather be relaxed in close encounters, and I do enjoy immersing myself in a game to the degree that some of this let go. I do not do that as "therapy", but as a fun thing to do in games. I've always had fun with games, and have always striven to make them as fun and open as possible. I believe that is something most people recognize when playing my games, and that it makes my games a bit better (especially for the shy amongst us).<br/><br/>Have a nice day!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166095">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166095/#Comment_166095" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T09:39:35+00:00" title="August 29, 2008  9:39AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I have only one remark, to this:<i>I don't play therapy games, I don't play touch games, I don't need teaching or growing.

I'm more comfortable with it than anyone else in my group is.  But prolonged periods of casual touch or simply having people in my personal space is pretty tiring for me.  Compared to my more extraverted husband, I get ridiculously tired after plane flights.  It wears on me to sit that close to people for a long time.  But I also tend to have good conversations with whoever I'm sitting next to, and I'm much more likely to have a long conversation with the person I'm sitting next to than my husband is.  So anyway, when I read the other thread about touching, the ars amandi stuff sounded awesome.  Touch is a powerful tool for me, and maybe that's in part because I as an introvert can't take it for granted.  But the idea of holding hands with someone for long periods of time during a game sounded downright unpleasant (though I might do it anyway), because that's not the sort of thing I can background-task.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite>Mechanics which involve touching or, say, handing out praise, are not merely uncomfortable to introverts</blockquote>\nAstaroth, can you say more about the second half of this, about handing out praise? [ed: do you mean mechanics that involve literally handing it out, or other aspects of that social interaction?] I'm curious because certain kinds of praise make me uncomfortable, but I'd always attributed that to cultural and gender factors.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166120">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166120/#Comment_166120" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-29T11:04:39+00:00" title="August 29, 2008 11:04AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite>My introverted brothers and sisters, speak out!

Exposing themselves to the judgement of others is feels wrong, simply because they know that their own sense of self is the only one that matters. being judged by others creates (<i>I'm not sure this is the right way to describe this, but you should get the idea</i>) a cognitive dissonance that interferes with fun.<br/>I need to stress, because it's easy to jump to this conclusion and misunderstand: this is NOT about shyness or low self-esteem or whatever.

I've just realised I must have cut out part of my post before posting it which discussed that. I was going to give the following example:<br/>Imagine a group engaged in a colaborative storytelling session. Everyone is fuilly engaged, throwing ideas around - from time time to time, one person leads then falters, and someone else comes in with an idea and they are off. There's lots of discussion and laughter, and praise at surprising ideas, and good-natured disagreements over some turns in the plot, and everyone has fun.<br/>The extrovert's primary pleasure is seeing everyone else engaged, and also being a part of the reason why they are having fun. <br/>The introvert's primary pleasure is the subject itself - the thing they are working on: is it an enjoyable story in it's own sake. He appreciates the other people being there, because the story wouldn't be as good without them - they are part of the process. But the banter and all that socialising, while it can be fun (withing sensible limits!), it is not the primary source of enjoyment.<br/><br/>A couple of disclaimers:<br/>Yes, the extrovert can be very concerned about the integrity of the story just as much as the introvert. And, of course, the introvert might not be concerned about the integrity of the story at all, he might just like making stories, even bad ones. But, speaking generally,  the pleasure gained from the session is being gained from different source.<br/>Also, yes, extroverts aren't just concerened about feedback - they do have personal tastes, just like an introvert, which is why some will play roleplaying games and others play football. But along with those personal tastes are these underlying perosnality traits - the introversion-extroversion axis is just one element of a very complex personality.

Remember, I said that introverts will have more restrictive personal space than extroverts are, and extroverts are more likely to have more permissive personal space. This is part of the definition of what an introvert is! Touch/don't touch is one of those things included in personal space. It's another intimacy thing: to introverts, some kinds of social interaction are more reserved for closer relationships (and sometimes not allowed even there!), whereas by contrast, extroverts are sluts - they'll touch/feel/sing with anyone! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Logos7" title="Logos7"><img alt="Logos7" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Logos7">Logos7</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166477/#Comment_166477" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T11:46:51+00:00" title="September  1, 2008 11:46AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted By: TomasHVM<br/>\n<br/>\nI have only one remark, to this:I don't play therapy games, I don't play touch games, I don't need teaching or growing. I don't play these games,<br/>\n<br/>\nThis is, as much of the rest stated in this discussion, not quite in touch with reality. Reality is that there are no such games. There are no "therapy games". There are really no "touch games". To say you don't play "such games" is like shouting in the void.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave a nice day!<br/>\n<br/>\njust riffing off this idea, maybe i am shouting at the void, the fruitful void....<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said I hope that they don't come.  I however see some games that appear not to have the emphasis on fun (however that is achieved) and seem to be focused on either teaching something, bringing something up, agonizing over things, etc. I don't have a big list of these games because I don't play them, but dogs is close (poking arround with what the group morality is ), My life with master seems to be a big angst fest (not at all what i would call fun as far as i can tell from actual play reports )  from what I can tell, The reason this thread came up is because some gamers are incorporating this, and some game designers inevitably are as well. Some games seem to exist for the sole purpose of provoking unhappy or unfun experiances so we can all laugh with the bravado of true bohemians afterward. I'm biased by all means, but I don't think I'm tiling at windmills as much as you make me out.<br/>\n<br/>\nEither way, I'll totally agree with the touch thing, My aversion to touch in general has little or nothing to do with my introversion. Its just a quirk, my introversion however is a wide set of quirks, preferences, and tools  that I use to handle stuff, and as such should not be dismissed lightly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166490">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Yasha" title="Yasha"><img alt="Yasha" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/535/nC2R7IBQNACRI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Yasha">Yasha</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166490/#Comment_166490" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T13:30:09+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  1:30PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2008 1:32PM by Yasha.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sensitivity to touch can be a component of a number of mental conditions, such as ADD, Asperger's, OCD, bipolar disorder, etc., so it is not just a function of introversion.  I suspect it is also related to family dynamics -- people from larger or warmer families seem to be more comfortable with touch.  Hopefully, touch-sensitive people are able to communicate their level of discomfort with touch, and avoid games that incorporate it, assuming that they do not want to stray from their comfort zone.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing I have noticed is that some people who are more comfortable with touch don't realize how much others can be uncomfortable with it.  One issue I see in using touch as a tool is that its effects can be so disparate, either uniting or repelling.  If the goal is to have people react to it according to the standard range of human reactions, that's one thing.  But if you have a single intent in mind, you need to realize that you are targeting a specific subset of the population.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut that said, life is a wonderful mess full of pains, risks and pleasures, and none of us are safe.  Stumbling into uncomfortable situations can be an incredible blessing at times, and setting up too many safety rules can keep people from living their life fully.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne aspect of RPGs is that they can change one's state of consciousness, just as rituals do.  We're most used to games that help create shared group states of consciousness -- such as suspense, fear or excitement -- for the purpose of entertainment, but there are conceivably no limitations.  Games can be used for therapy, hopefully done with the assistance of a professional.  Games can help people focus, which is useful for education.  Games could be used for brainwashing -- I could easily see some kind of LARP incorporated into a retreat or seminar (with restrictions on bathroom breaks).<br/>\n<br/>\nGames can be useful for other areas of growth.  Tools like touch can help people achieve a properly receptive state of consciousness and leaving one's comfort zone is necessary for growth.  I don't see a problem with using games for purposes other than fun, but considering the potential risks, there should be accommodations for people who want to drop out midway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_166507">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166507/#Comment_166507" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-01T17:23:47+00:00" title="September  1, 2008  5:23PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 1, 2008 5:24PM by Tristan.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: demiurgeastaroth</cite>Remember, I said that introverts will have more restrictive personal space than extroverts are, and extroverts are more likely to have more permissive personal space.

I was mistaken.<br/><br/>I completely and utterly disagree. And I base my definition on the one it was given to me by a couple of shrinks and several text books.<br/><br/>The definition of introversion is not about personal space. It is about the way people process things (introverts inwards, extroverts outwards). It is about being reserved, introspective, self aware.<br/><br/>What I said was that that axis, about being <b>intro</b>verted (as in <i>inside</i>) or <b>extro</b>verted (as in <i>outside</i>), is what could be considered the middle point for defining introversion.<br/><br/>There are several other aspects (such as personal space issues, shyness, lack of expressiveness) that are related, a lot more common and some times more problematic. But they are by no means exclusive (or defining) of introverts. And so I said that one thing is the "intro/extro" axis, and a different, related, but non exclusive axis is about "touch/non-touch".\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Yasha</cite>Sensitivity to touch can be a component of a number of mental conditions, such as ADD, Asperger's, OCD, bipolar disorder, etc., so it is not just a function of introversion.

I have noticed there are some cultures that are more prone to physical contact (such as most Latin American ones), and thus even us introverts see it as less of an issue. (I am from M\xe9xico, and we are way more used to more intense, "familiar" touching, even among not so close people. Not that anyone likes to be touched, but it is less common.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_166747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/166747/#Comment_166747" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-03T07:07:38+00:00" title="September  3, 2008  7:07AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 3, 2008 7:08AM by NomdePlume.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tristan</cite><br/>See, I thought we had reached an understanding in there. I was mistaken.<br/><br/>I completely and utterly disagree. And I base my definition on the one it was given to me by a couple of shrinks and several text books.</blockquote>\nI'm not really concerned about that. I have my own authorities, too.\n<blockquote>The definition of introversion is not about personal space. It is about the way people process things (introverts inwards, extroverts outwards). It is about being reserved, introspective, self aware.</blockquote>\nHere, I agree completely.<br/>\n<blockquote>There are several other aspects (such as personal space issues, shyness, lack of expressiveness) that are related, a lot more common and some times more problematic. But they are by no means exclusive (or defining) of introverts. </blockquote>\nI agree with this statement, too, if I understand correctly. I agree that these features are not exclusive to introverts. The point I have been trying to make, is that introverts are much more likely to have (at least some of) them than extroverts are, to a greater degree than extroverts do.<br/>It's not going to be true of all introverts, but it is a common introvert trait.<br/>The process of developing into a healthy adult is more likely to create these traits in an introvert than it is in an extrovert. Introverts enjoy "alone time," and enjoy distance (emotional and spiritual, and as a result, often physical as well) from others. As result, the behaviours they learn while growing up and maturing are more likely to include a desire and maybe need for broader personal space, while an extrovert will more often desire and may need smaller personal space. Exactly what kinds of personal space people need or don't need or how much will vary from person to person, shaped by their life experience, but as a trend, I'm sure this is true.<br/><br/>I suspect, and hope, that we aren't in as much disagreement as we think we are <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Don't Touch Me! - Page 2 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7401/dont-touch-me/p2" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Don't Touch Me! - Page 2" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/7401/dont-touch-me/p2" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="No, we are not.

Touch/don't touch is one of those things included in personal space.</blockquote>\n(Emphasis added by me to stress specifically the part I disagreed.)<br/><br/>Indeed, "it's not going to be true of all introverts, but it is a common introvert trait" and "the process of developing into a healthy adult is more likely to create these traits in an introvert than it is in an extrovert".
