I'm a little sad that a Husk can't possess or inhabit a human form, there's a lot of tradition behind The Devil In Human Guise. Plus, people would probably notice the 5 ton Maggot Husk hanging around the courthouse sucking up injustice. But if 5-tons of Maggot Husk were crammed into the portly-but-normal-sized body of a judge or lawyer... Anywho, just my 2 cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420386/#Comment_420386" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T21:31:21+00:00" title="August 19, 2013  9:31PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am intrigued! I must admit that I'm a little puzzled about the decision to describe it specifically as "a superhero RPG," but maybe your goal was to counter genre expectations.\xa0At first glance, it reminds me more of "angels &amp; demons"/"Biblical urban fantasy" games like In Nomine or Armageddon. Most of my players picking up a "supers game," on the other hand, are probably expecting PCs having different powers and different origin stories. I could see taking the basic premise in a bunch of different directions, myself \u2013\xa0running it as straight-up supers for one group, as the typical \u201990s-style "secret factions at war" premise for another group, and so on. It seems light and flexible enough to fool around with (and that's a good thing in my book).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe" title="Caoimhe"><img alt="Caoimhe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caoimhe">Caoimhe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420391/#Comment_420391" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-19T22:49:31+00:00" title="August 19, 2013 10:49PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought about doing that with Husks but then it seemed a little too cliched to me.

Personally, for really lightweight games that fit in a few pages, I sometimes really appreciate when some of the big questions are left up to me to fill in, or when a few different ways of running the game are implied through no more than a paragraph. (Like, at the end, "Variants: 1) SECRET WAR. Both halves of the fallen angels were absorbed into humans, so some PCs might have darker powers. Is the war between those with powers of light versus those between powers of darkness, or is it based on what people use their powers to accomplish? 2) HISTORICAL. The comet passed by during some other period in history. How does society react differently when people get holy powers in the time of the Roman empire? During the Salem witch trials?") You already do this to some extent with your random roll to determine what kind of team the PCs have.\n<blockquote>Yeah, I kind of was genre-bending there with having "superheroes," but seeing what you can do when everyone has roughly the same powers and origins.

I think there's still enough familiar genre trappings to make it obvious to people that they're playing a supers game (spandex and cosmic battles and all). I have never played GURPS Lensmen, but I suspect it may be the closest thing there is to a Green Lantern RPG. I'm sure they way they get around commonalities between characters is that it's GURPS, so there's a billion tiny details to fiddle with. Not exactly a model I'd hold up to a tight, four-page game.<br/><br/>Anyway, hope I didn't make it sound like you can't make it work as-is. Just offering some food for thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
