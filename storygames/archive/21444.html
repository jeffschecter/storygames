That's much simpler (as long as you have an internal sense of what's roughly appropriate in pre-industrial combat) and more interesting, as it makes daggers better while wrestling, maces better against armored opponents, swords better against maces, scythes better just about never (still better than being unarmed!), etc.<br/><br/>The way I do it is that "martial weapons" all get d6 damage dice, improvised weapons get d4 and unarmed gets d2 or d3 (depending on the phase of the moon for all I can discern). Because I don't believe that hit points are physical in the first place, that's not even based on any kind of physics engine thinking: it's just a thematic step-ladder saying "we expect more fatalities when you hit them with a Real Weapon". Any more damage will need to come from skill or magic weapons or whatever - like, maybe an actual Gun does 1d20 damage? I'd like that for a certain sort of theming.<br/><br/>Class-based damage would of course be fine, coming from where I'm coming from. I personally would be brave and just say that everybody gets d6 as per what I said above, except Fighters get d8 for weapons they're familiar with and d10 with a special attack option (weapon type specialization or some other boring idea). Should work for the sort of mechanical context where class-based damage is even considered. I rather like the idea that Fighters are the fighting specialist class, and the other classes don't actually need to be treated as fighting-concerned at all; maybe you have some class traits that accidentally make fighting a bit easier (like say stealth for a Thief), maybe you don't, but either way you're nowhere near as competent as the Fighter. The combined-arms paradigm from modern D&amp;D is dumb.<br/><br/>By the way, an interesting observation: that ever-present Gygaxian weapons list in whatever D&amp;D text you're using? That's the enemy, you should just ditch that. No player in the history of the game has made a worthwhile tactical choice about real dungeon commando combat where that list played any role. It's strictly a red herring, an illusion that pretends to bring depth where in reality it just brings a slower character creation. The first real weapon choice should be "who gets this magic sword we finally found", not the developmentally disabled drooling over three or four superficially different types of swords in the equipment list.<br/><br/>If you doubt me, let me tell you a couple of things about combat as it relates to the D&amp;D weapons lists. These should be blindingly obvious to anybody who's spent a minute outside a rpg book learning about pre-industrial warfare:<br/><b>*</b> Axes are only popular combat implements for cultures with inferior metallurgy. The combination of unbalanced weight + sharp edge makes the axe inferior when pitted against a sword <i>or</i> advanced armor. Their main advantage is getting an edge with a limited amount of metal of poor quality; could be a price break in D&amp;D, I guess?<br/><b>*</b> Maces, warhammers, etc. exist at all for the single reason that an unbalanced, concentrated weight works well for causing injury through armor (either puncturing or simply smashing). Picking that as your dungeoneering weapon is basically saying that you want to lose in swordplay against the goblin armed with a, well, sword - the goblin's weapon is much faster given equal skill, and the mace does nothing for you that a sword wouldn't if the goblin is unarmored.<br/><b>*</b> Two-handed swords are intended for breaking spear formations. It is a rather dangerous and skilled job to be the vanguard of a fucking tercio. Is that really what you're equipping yourself for? If not, leave that two-handed sword in the rack. Also do that to the other two-handed weapons, they have similar specialty purposes that have nothing to do with adventuring.<br/><b>*</b> Swords are good all-around weapons. You should pick up one, of the type favoured in this time and place as a general self-defense weapon. Choose length as per your own height and strength. Ignore the variations in the equipment list, they don't really exist - the differences are minute, subjective, local and where this isn't the case it's because that sword's not intended to be used the way you imagine you're using yours, or that sword doesn't have any reason to exist in this time period in the first place.<br/><b>*</b> Spears are the second legit choice, and because they're cheap, you have no reason not to carry one. The spear is superior to the sword in formation and also outside it if you've got skillz and room to move - it's longer, after all! A further discourse upon their comparative advantages unfortunately does not fit in this margin note.<br/><b>*</b> Having a shield is superior to not having one, your choice; the only real advantage of not having one to go with your sword is that you're a slightly smaller and lighter combat package, which may be situationally useful. The shield is also a martial choice as much as armor, so no blending in with the civilian populace in most places if you carry one. A spear is much easier to use effectively two-handed, I'll note, but I'd still prefer having a tie-on buckler even then.<br/><br/>Any other stupid weapons in the list that I forget right now? I don't think I need to explain why daggers are a rather limited choice. Given that, you buy yourself a "sword" and a "spear" and maybe a "mace" if you're an actual soldier and expect similar in opposition. Doesn't really take a list of 30 alternatives, does it?<br/><br/>Considering the above, I don't see how I could go with the traditional weapon list bullshit. You either go realistic, or you decide that weapons are just color. If you do realistic, then odds are that you'll be able to play quite a while with just swords and spears before a player cracks open an actual book on the topic and learns how to leverage that warhammer or pike or whatever weird thing. If you do color, then who cares what the players describe their characters attacking with - it's all going to be d6 damage anyway, or d8 for the Fighter, and it's no skin off my nose if it's a "war axe" or "war fan" that you're rocking.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469300">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469300/#Comment_469300" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-26T01:44:32+00:00" title="January 26, 2018  1:44AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a> I'm more that the weapon is just color--but I know that particular weapons matter for some.

Doubling up on this differentiation in damage as well may make combat entirely non-viable for them: not only are they unlikely to hit, but even if they do, they may not even be capable of doing enough damage for it to take down the opponent.<br/><br/>This is a big part of why I allow e.g. magic-users to use real weapons and cause the same damage as everybody else with them. Their physical stats and weak class bonus to hit already make them unlikely to hit, and I would rather have them making an attack be a hail mary move than entirely futile. If the MU is in a desperate enough situation to attack a 1 HD enemy (the only kind they should attack, generally speaking), and they roll well enough to succeed, I want them to have that 50% chance of a take-down rather than just a whiff by other name.<br/><br/>Fighters I'm not so concerned with at the other end, for many reasons. They're operating in their specialty, so it's difficult to make them too good at it. Extra damage is just over-kill (and certainty of getting a one-hit kill) much of the time at low levels, so it's not nearly a linear increase in effectiveness when you move from e.g. d10 to d12.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469304">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469304/#Comment_469304" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-26T02:12:15+00:00" title="January 26, 2018  2:12AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> Great stuff!

All reasonable concerns.<br/><br/>I think there are a few different things to consider here:<br/><br/>What's the purpose of differentiating weapons in your game? Is it a desire for realism? To give the players a reason to pick different weapons? To create tactical choices for players to exploit? <br/><br/>What's the role of hit points and combat in your vision of the game? Do they represent luck, skill, something else?<br/><br/>Given hit points as an abstraction, for instance, and your only desire to have some characters deliver more damage per round than others, damage dice based on class makes much more sense than damage based on weapons.<br/><br/>Remember that weapon restrictions, armour class, hit points, and your chances of hitting all affect your "damage output".<br/><br/>Hitting more often for the same amount of damage (or making more attacks) still increases your expected damage output. A penalty to hit (or a decreased thac0 or attack bonus) accomplishes the same thing.<br/><br/>If you don't watch all the factors, you might get some funny results: for example, with the tables suggested above, a wizard would deal a d2 of damage with a dagger... but they're not supposed to be using bigger weapons in most rulesets! So now you're penalizing your poor magic users twice. That's no good! The poor wizard already can't hit anything and now you've cut his damage further in half?

Level\t1\t1+1\t2-3\t4-5\t6-7<br/><b>1</b>\t1\t1\t1\t1\t1<br/><b>2</b>\t1\t1\t1\t1\t1<br/><b>3</b>\t1\t1\t1\t1\t1<br/><b>4</b>\t2\t1\t1\t1\t1<br/><b>5</b>\t2\t2\t1\t1\t1<br/><b>6</b>\t3\t2\t2\t1\t1<br/><br/>So a 6th level character deals 3d6 damage to a 1HD creature. <br/><br/>Sorry couldn't figure out the html for the table. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li

Qualities can take the form of advantages providing a tactical benefit in combat, or impose drawbacks to make up for improved damage or another advantage. Most weapons have at least one quality, often more.<br/><br/>Adaptable<br/>An Adaptable weapon is designed for use with one or two hands. When you wield this weapon in two hands, increase the weapon\u2019s damage by +1.<br/><br/>Bulk<br/>Some weapons are heavy or awkward and, thus, slow you down in combat. If a weapon has a Bulk rating, it applies toward your total Bulk for the purposes of reducing your Movement.<br/><br/>Close Range<br/>A Close Range weapon has an effective range of 10 yards, meaning you can attack opponents within 10 yards at no penalty. You can still attack opponents beyond this range, but you take a penalty die for every 10 yards beyond this range. Thus, attacking an opponent that\u2019s 11 yards away imposes a penalty die on your Marksmanship test.<br/><br/>Defensive<br/>Defensive weapons serve a dual function. They can be used as weapons, but they are often more effective in turning aside your enemies\u2019 attacks. If you are armed with a Defensive weapon and do not attack with it, add the weapon\u2019s Defensive rating to your Combat Defense.<br/>Many Defensive weapons also have the Off-hand quality, allowing you to wield them and a primary weapon at the same time. If you choose to add your Off-hand bonus to your damage, you lose the Defensive Bonus from the weapon until the start of your next turn.<br/><br/>Entangling<br/>An Entangling weapon slows and hampers your opponent. A foe struck by an Entangling weapon reduces his Movement to 1 yard and takes a \u20135 penalty on all tests. The target can free himself with a Challenging (9) Athletics test (bonus dice from Strength apply) or Challenging (9) Agility test (bonus dice from Contortionist apply). You cannot make further attacks with an Entangling weapon as long as it affects your target.<br/><br/>Fast<br/>A Fast weapon is designed to slip through your opponent\u2019s defenses and strike rapidly. When you make a divided attack using a Fast weapon, you gain a bonus die on each test. These bonus dice cannot exceed the number of test dice rolled per attack.<br/><br/>Grab<br/>Grab weapons let you seize and hold onto an opponent, preventing him from moving away from you. Whenever you successfully hit an opponent with a Grab weapon and equal or beat that opponent\u2019s passive Athletics result (Strength applies), you may, if you choose, grab that opponent.<br/>A grabbed opponent cannot move until you release him (a Free Action) or until that opponent beats you on an opposed Fighting test (Brawling applies; A Lesser Action). A grabbed opponent can only make attacks using Brawling weapons or short blades. Finally, grabbed opponents take a \u20135 penalty on their Combat Defense (minimum 1). While you grab an opponent, you cannot move, and may only make attacks against that opponent using a Grab or Off-hand weapon.<br/><br/>Impale<br/>Whenever you get three or more degrees of success with an Impale weapon, you drive the weapon through your opponent! You must immediately succeed on a Challenging (9) Athletics test. A failed test indicates you are disarmed, as the weapon remains buried in your opponent. If you succeed, your opponent cannot move, but you cannot attack with the weapon, either. To yank the weapon free, you must succeed on an Athletics test against a Difficulty of 3 + the opponent\u2019s Armor Rating. Success frees the weapon, and every additional degree deals the weapon\u2019s damage again. Pinning an Opponent: As a Greater Action, you can use an Impale weapon to pin an impaled foe to the ground, wall, or some other surface. Roll an Athletics test against your opponent\u2019s passive Endurance result (Resilience applies). A successful test prevents your opponent from moving until he pulls himself free. Getting Free: An impaled opponent may remove the weapon by spending a Greater Action and successfully rolling a Challenging (9) Athletics test. Removal inflicts one injury\u2014or one wound if the victim cannot take any more injuries. An ally may remove the weapon safely by succeeding on a Formidable (12) Healing test as a Greater Action. Failure removes the weapon but deals 1 point of damage for every 5 points by which the test failed (minimum 1 point).<br/><br/>Long Range<br/>Provided you have a clear shot, you can fire a Long Range weapon at targets up to 100 yards away. For every 100 yards of distance between you and your target, you take a penalty die on your Marksmanship test.<br/><br/>Mounted<br/>Mounted weapons are too large and bulky for use on foot and are thus intended for use while mounted on a horse or some other steed. Using these weapons on foot imposes \u20132D on your Fighting tests.<br/><br/>Off-Hand<br/>An Off-hand weapon can be wielded in your off-hand, allowing you to add your Off-hand modifier to your primary weapon damage on a successful Fighting test. To gain this benefit, you must spend a Greater Action to make a Two-weapon attack.<br/><br/>Piercing<br/>Piercing weapons bypass armor. Whenever you hit an opponent with a Piercing weapon, your damage ignores an amount of Armor Rating equal to the listed value.<br/><br/>Powerful<br/>Strong characters can put more muscle behind Powerful weapons and, thus, deal more damage on a successful hit. For every bonus die in Strength, increase a Powerful weapon\u2019s damage by +1.<br/><br/>Reach<br/>When armed with a Reach weapon, you can attack opponents that are not adjacent to you. You can roll a Fighting test with a Reach weapon at any opponent up to 3 yards away. However, attacking any foe inside 3 yards with a Reach weapon imposes a penalty die on your Fighting test.<br/><br/>Reload<br/>A Marksmanship weapon with the Reload quality requires an action to reload the weapon after it has been fired. The weapon\u2019s quality specifies what sort of action is required to reload the weapon, either Lesser or Greater.<br/><br/>Set for Charge<br/>A Set for Charge weapon is too unwieldy for use in normal combat and functions only when used with the Set for Charge action.<br/><br/>Shattering<br/>Shattering weapons are designed to smash through shields, parrying weapons, and armor. Whenever you get two or more degrees on a Fighting test made with a Shattering weapon, you reduce the opponent\u2019s Defensive Bonus or Armor Bonus by the amount indicated by the quality. The Shattering weapon affects weapons with a Defensive Bonus first. Reducing a weapon\u2019s Defensive Bonus or an armor\u2019s Armor Bonus to 0 destroys it.<br/><br/>Slow<br/>A Slow weapon is cumbersome and difficult to wield with speed and grace. You may not make Divided Attacks using Slow weapons.<br/><br/>Staggering<br/>The force of a Staggering weapon\u2019s hit can knock a foe senseless. Whenever you attain two or more degrees with a successful Fighting test using a Staggering weapon, you may sacrifice one degree to prevent your foe from taking a Greater Action on his next turn.<br/><br/>Two-Handed<br/>Large weapons need both hands to be wielded properly in combat. If you use only one hand, you take \u20132D on your Fighting test.<br/><br/>Unwieldy<br/>An Unwieldy weapon is tough to use while mounted, so when astride a steed, you take \u20132D on Fighting or Marksmanship tests made to attack with this weapon.<br/><br/>Vicious<br/>Some weapons are so good at what they do that fighting with them produces ugly outcomes. If you defeat a foe when wielding a Vicious weapon, the consequences of defeat are always death. A victim may burn a Destiny Point, as normal, to avoid this fate.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469375">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/vgunn" title="vgunn"><img alt="vgunn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/vgunn">vgunn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469375/#Comment_469375" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-27T23:51:07+00:00" title="January 27, 2018 11:51PM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 27, 2018 11:54PM by vgunn.">edited January 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Now I want to be more abstract, but may there may be some things I can draw from.<br/><br/>So a few of examples:<br/><br/>Battle-axe  (1d6, Adaptable)<br/>Hand-axe  (1d4, Defensive +1, Off-hand +1)<br/>Mattock  (1d8, Powerful, Slow, Two-handed)<br/><br/>Now if you went with class, then it would be:<br/><br/>Dwarf\u2014d8 <br/>Battle-axe: Adaptable<br/>Hand-axe: Defensive, Off-hand<br/>Mattock: Powerful, Slow, Two-handed <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469376">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469376/#Comment_469376" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-28T00:21:48+00:00" title="January 28, 2018 12:21AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like each class having their own small, clearly delineated set of weapons choices. Better yet, what I like to do is that instead of weapon choices I think in terms of combat paradigm choices. (My <i>Advanced Tunnels &amp; Trolls</i> homebrew totally runs off combat paradigms, except they're tied to stats, not classes.)<br/><br/>Maybe a non-combat class has like three options, while combat classes have five. Two of your choices are sort of general, while the rest are more situationally useful. Each class should have some styles that are shared with other classes, and the non-combat classes probably use some pretty common ones. Every choice is fictionally very distinctive - doesn't need to be realistic, just something you can talk about in terms of combat choreography and fantasy memes. Switching styles usually takes too long to do in middle of combat because of cognitive issues and needing to switch weapons.<br/><br/>So the dwarf, for instance, maybe they have four choices because they're almost pure fighters, and those choices are something like this:<br/><br/><b>Axe-dwarf:</b> traditional axe-wielding horned-helmet heavy armour dwarf combat paradigm. Strong against trees, orcs, in defense, underground. Weak against mobile foes (cavalry, flying enemies), magic. You <b>must</b> have an axe to do it, and you <b>benefit</b> of having either a shield or two-handed bigger axe, heavy armor, horned helmet, warhammer, a bandolier of misericordes.<br/><br/><b>Exotic dwarf:</b> abandon the axe and go crazy with exotic weapons - you never know what the dwarf throws down, but he's sure to have trained with it obsessively. Strong against conventional foes, magic, dwarves. Weak against barbarians (including orcs), berserks, other exotics. You <b>must</b> have a signature weapon (war fan, chain-scythe, two-headed axe, throwing shrew, whatever), and you benefit of extra gadgets, alchemy, light armour, mount.<br/><br/><b>Crossbow-dwarf:</b> Ditch the helmet and go shoot-and-scoot. Strong against mounts, in skirmish, in obfuscating terrain, in surprise. Weak in melee. You <b>must</b> have a crossbow or gear bow, and you benefit of extra bolts, knowing its repair, dark clothes, light armour, punch-dagger, smoke bombs, trap-making kit.<br/><br/><b>Staff fighting:</b> Similar to how humans do it, except being strong and small makes the staff even better as an equalizer. Strong against unarmed and small arms, and in wrestling. Weak against non-humanoids, armor. You <b>must</b> have a fighting staff, and you benefit of any dagger, gauntlets, iron-toed boots.<br/><br/>As you can see, each combat option for a class has mandatory equipment requirements as well as bonus requirements. Maybe you only get half your to-hit bonus without the full set, or you get a small bonus to damage for having the full set, or whatever. Equipment quality should help, too - like, a master-class piece gives you double the benefit, however that's mechanized. Each combat option has its situational strengths and weaknesses. A character can equip to utilize multiple styles as situation demands, or they can equip for one style and only minimally for that, but there are encumbrance and price issues, particularly if you want to equip yourself well and with quality equipment.<br/><br/>Could be interesting. Obviously it'd be trivial to add extra styles - maybe Fighters can learn new ones up to their class level, or something like that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469377/#Comment_469377" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-01-28T00:26:08+00:00" title="January 28, 2018 12:26AM">January 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like that idea a lot.

The most commonly proposed system is that characters do damage based on their hit die (d4 for magic users, d6 for thieves, d8 for clerics and d10 for fighters - using the AD&amp;D class hit dice).<br/><br/>It's an idea that I find very appealing. 1. It's simple, super simple. 2. It (potentially) does away with that old D&amp;D stickler - "why can't my wizard / cleric use a sword?".<br/><br/>So with damage by class a wizard can use a sword - he just won't do much damage with it. This makes sense to me. Of course, anyone can pick up and use (almost) any weapon, but without proper training (like, say, being a fighter) they're not going to be able to use it at full effectiveness.<br/><br/>At the low end of the damage spectrum it seems to make sense. However I've wondered if it makes sense at the other end (fighters). Is a trained warrior really as effective in combat with a dagger as with a longsword? I don't claim any knowledge of such things, but I presume not, otherwise the longsword would probably never have been invented.<br/><br/>So, what I've been thinking is that a mixture of the two systems would probably work - <i>damage by class and by weapon</i>. This sounds like it's going to be complicated and involve tables, but it doesn't! All you need to do is say that any character can use any weapon, and all weapons do the damage listed as normal - <b>BUT up to a maximum of the character's hit die</b>. So a wizard wielding a dagger, a club, a sword - any weapon at all - will do d4 damage. But a fighter wielding a dagger will be a far less formidable opponent than a fighter wielding a 2-handed sword.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469771/#Comment_469771" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T20:04:05+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  8:04PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That seems like a very reasonable compromise, and produces the desired result (a wizard is happy with his dagger, whereas the warrior is going to look around for something more hefty), as well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469773">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469773/#Comment_469773" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T20:14:56+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  8:14PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can't remember if I've said this here, but <i>13th Age</i> has damage-by-class built in fundamentally and done well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi" title="yukamichi"><img alt="yukamichi" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/677/nHW6876KEN77F.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/yukamichi">yukamichi</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469774/#Comment_469774" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-07T20:21:00+00:00" title="February  7, 2018  8:21PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/vgunn" rel="nofollow">vgunn</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>Is a trained warrior really as effective in combat with a dagger as with a longsword?

(Yes, this means that the advantage can shift round-by-round, as the characters manipulate the fighting distance, the "are we wrestling" status flag, between them.) Having the advantage always be the same mechanically keeps it simple, and having the players utilize their understanding of what the fiction actually means keeps it "realistic" - or whatever word you'd want to use for an attempt to portray different weapons as different.<br/><br/>I feel like this solution (rulings based on your own understanding of combat) is not taken nearly seriously enough despite it being technically superior in the OSR context. I cannot help but find this intellectually lazy: ever since Gygax set the precedent in AD&amp;D for detailed rules texts as a solution to lack of rules, everybody's acting like your only choices are to not have this sort of detail, or to draw it from an immutable and often rather faulty and over-engineered rules text. The way commercial D&amp;D developed really encouraged a priesthood of game designers, the ever-so-smart people who are the only ones competent to tell you how splint mail interacts with a bastard sword.<br/><br/>If you feel the work of determining consistent rulings to be daunting, I suggest maintaining a "combat advantage worksheet" for the campaign. Just tell the players to ask the GM for combat advantage every time they feel like they should have it, and have the GM declare combat advantage for the monsters, and write the decisions down every time. This is not complex, this is not unnecessary work - this is, rather, at the heart of play the game. If talking about how very appropriate the dwarf's weapon choice is to the situation isn't at the core, then I don't know what is. It won't take long for you to have all the commonly appearing situations written up.<br/><br/>Note that this solution can easily be combined with class-based weapon proficiencies (a penalty or ban on magic-users using swords) or class-based effectiveness limits (class-based weapon damage) if one wants to make it simultaneously true that Fighters are better than Magic-users in combat, but the Fighter still wants to pick a knife when wrestling with an alligator. You never should have to write the weapon profiles out, but what you'll end up with is something like this:<br/><br/><b>Dagger for a Fighter:</b> dmg d8, disadvantage in most situations, advantage in wrestling. Inconspicuous, cheap.<br/><b>Dagger for Magic-User:</b> dmg d4,  disadvantage in most situations, advantage in wrestling.

Both are simple formalistic abstract effects (the "advantage" is always the same) that you just go around applying as needed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469801/#Comment_469801" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T10:04:29+00:00" title="February  8, 2018 10:04AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's the recent game -- I think it's SF genre -- that has a concept of "the initiative," where someone starts with it, but then people fight over who has it, and not having it limits you to reaction rather than action. It's fucking brilliant, and would be great here -- even if it's more like "have the advantage" because you have a sword and they have a dagger, but then you make a maneuvering attack that deals no damage but flips the advantage because you stepped inside the sword's range and grappled with your knife in their back.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469802">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469802/#Comment_469802" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T10:18:43+00:00" title="February  8, 2018 10:18AM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Eero on basically all accounts, of course.<br/><br/>Somewhat relevant, though definitely not D&amp;D-like:\n<ul><li><i>Circle of Hands</i> by Ron Edwards</li>\n<li><i>Apocalypse World: Fallen Empires</i> by Vincent Baker</li></ul> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_469816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469816/#Comment_469816" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-08T13:53:02+00:00" title="February  8, 2018  1:53PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Eero's post made me laugh.

You can buy points of damage to increase this amount, but you\u2019ve got to pay for it with HP.

Thinking about it some more, I think the damage buy is done as you advance, rather than each for combat situation. Lets that for each level you gain, you can increase the weapon damage--but it costs you HP to do it. Example, a 2nd level fighter rolls a d8 and gets 5--he adds to his 6, for a total of 11HP. He could spend 2 HP to increase his weapon damage to 5, but now has 9HP. It's probably worth doing, but for a magic-user, that probably isn't the case--at least for a few levels if they only roll a d4 to increase HP.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_474277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474277/#Comment_474277" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-30T13:52:18+00:00" title="May 30, 2018  1:52PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe spend AC (until your next turn) for damage instead?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_474279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/474279/#Comment_474279" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-05-30T14:31:22+00:00" title="May 30, 2018  2:31PM">May 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 30, 2018 2:32PM by Paul_T.">edited May 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Spending permanent HP for a damage bonus makes some sense.
