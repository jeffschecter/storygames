The intention is to use this thread to discuss our experiences. How the game played, what worked, what didn't etc.<br/><br/>For those who don't know Left Coast is a game by Steve Hickey. The protagonists are weird sci-fi writers in 1950s-60s Generifornia, writing fiction and trying <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">not</span> to fuck up their lives. As far as I'm concerned the premise is awesome. Mechanically it's GMless. Some players play authors, others play NPC and others play "Creators" - which are kind of "small g" GMs. It's designed for smaller groups but we are pushing the envelope with six players.<br/><br/>We played out first session last week. About half the players attempted to read the rules. One of us (luckily) really grokked it from the reading (he said he read it out loud). Personally it usually takes playing through something at least once for me to get what a game is on about and generally I really only gain a good sense of how a system works after a few sessions (at least). But back to Left Coast.<br/><br/>The setup was really enjoyable although quite lengthy (it took about 1.5 hours, half the session). With our six players we elected for "traditional" role assignments; two Authors, two Creators and two NPC players, although other configurations are possible. We used a large piece of paper split into quadrants labelled Money, Social, Trouble and Weird. The group then went ahead and brainstormed two Authors (including name and type) and a cast of supporting NPCs for each Author. The NPCs were each assigned to an Author and to a quadrant. The whole setup was quite organic, we spent time throwing ideas around and taking on suggestions to flesh things out. The setting felt ready to hit the ground running, full of story possibilities by the time we were done. <br/><br/>We then launched into the our first scene. Following this each player took turns to invoke various scenes types. We found the turns are quite time consuming. Both sessions we didn't make it all the way around the table, i.e. every player did not get a turn. <br/><br/>Another concern is whether NPC players feel like their role is rewarding. The players playing NPCs seemed to indicate that they did. But they did say that it was more the infrequency of turns that was a bit of a problem. <br/><br/>There is plenty more I have to say. I'll revisit this post soon. I just wanted to get it up here and open up the discussion for members of our group and anyone else interested in the game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365838">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Russell" title="Russell"><img alt="Russell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Russell">Russell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365838/#Comment_365838" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T01:35:56+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  1:35AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What was the fiction like?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365919/#Comment_365919" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T08:37:55+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  8:37AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't read the rules, but I am confused by player's playing NPC's.

You're right: NPC is the term I'm using for characters who aren't the main characters (it stands for 'Non-Protagonist Character'). \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mathalus</cite>I like the idea of allowing some players to just come out and say, "I will play a supporting role." Is that what this is?</blockquote>\nI'll give you two answers, because I can see two ways of interpreting this:<br/><br/>1. All players are allowed (and encouraged) to play NPCs. <br/><br/>2. Depending on how the group distributes the authority in the game, some players will have a more supporting role. In Ritchie's group of six, having two Authors and two Creators leaves two people to primarily focus on playing NPCs. In smaller groups, players may double-up on this positions: for instance in a three-player game you could have a player who's an Author, a Creator (for the other player), *and* an NPC Owner.<br/><br/>Does that make sense?<br/><br/><br/>I'm keen to hear more about how the game went, Ritchie. What aspects of the rules do you think made the turns take so long?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366025/#Comment_366025" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T12:04:22+00:00" title="March  8, 2012 12:04PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also: I'm trying to eliminate jargon from the game.

I think we had some trouble coming up with scenes and scene goals which caused a bit of time delay. But once a scene was rolling we didn't tend to let them drag on (mostly). I think we could get better at this.<br/><br/>There could be a starting starting point issue i.e. there are a lot of hooks but no bang, maybe there needs to be some sort of bang at the beginning to get the Authors' stories going, with well a bang. Turns may get faster as there is more backstory to build on, I'm not sure. <br/><br/>A lack of familiarity with the rules, since we've only played twice, probably contributed to slower play but there are a lot of different contingencies for player types, turn types and scene types. I think this could all be simplified somehow. These are just impressions though because I still don't really feel like I quite have the rules under my belt. The dice mechanics seem to work quite well, there is a good balance of success and failure - rolls feel important.<br/><br/>Russ, I'd prefer to  let Paul cover the fiction as he took notes but to summarise our two Authors are:<br/><br/>Jeff R. Howell (played by Elliot) and T. Alfred Gosling (played by me)<br/><br/>Jeff is a "Real Man" type. Being bank rolled by his girlfriend's (who is in a cult) rancher father. He also has a brother, Bruce and sister-in-law, Sophie. It just came out (Secret)* that Sophie is in love with Jeff. We've only had one "Story" scene (I type of scene where the game fiction becomes about the story ficition that an Author is writing (awesome). It turned out to be religio/political yarn on a space station. We based all the characters really heavily on the NPCs/supporting characters from Jeff's life which was cool and the whole thing turned out to be an ok first try at fiction within the fiction. <br/><br/>Alfred is a "Visionary" type. He has an overbearing neurotic mother, an aspirant social climbing wife and a townie best friend. He's struggling with his writing and his demons. There are shadowy figures on the periphery. Towards the end of last sesh his fears were confirmed, after a hasty retreat from a library scene he was accosted by a grungy hippy who wanted him to "See the truth! - Man." Now they're on the run together and he's mixed up with some fringe group who have uncovered government mind control experiments.<br/><br/>I hope some of the other players chime in soon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366131">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SmZA" title="SmZA"><img alt="SmZA" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SmZA">SmZA</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366131/#Comment_366131" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T19:13:01+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  7:13PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 7:14PM by SmZA.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You beat me, Richie!<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Left Coast: a playtest AP</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Players</b> (six total):<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Authors<br/>\nRichie plays T.

The Authors split the cast between them depending on how social or introverted they are.<br/>\nGosling is an alcoholic shut-in, so he has less NPCs in his life than Jeff.<br/>\nEach NPC falls into one of four categories representing different sources of conflict in the Author's life. The quadrants are Weird, Social, Money, Trouble.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters attached to Gosling<br/>\n<br/>\nAlly Gosling (MONEY) - Gosling's wife, played by Elliot. Ally is Gosling's nominated <i>Most Significant Person</i> in his life. Born to rich parents, she has high aspirations that Gosling cannot meet. Her parents don't approve of their marriage.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Bud" (SOCIAL) - Gosling's best friend, played by Ben. Bud and Gosling know each other from childhood. Bud is a blue-collar mechanic who thinks Gosling's a good writer but is worried he will go off the 'deep end'. Because he has some enthusiasm for technology and engineering, Gosling sometimes consults him for ideas for his sci-fi stories.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Agent (WEIRD) - played by Gosling's Creator, John. The Agent lives next door to Gosling.<br/>\n<br/>\nGosling's Mother (TROUBLE) - played by Euan. A widow, Gosling's mother Cecilia is a thorn in his side, constantly undermining him but also desperate for attention. She is always comparing him unfavourably with his dead father. She is the only person who uses his first name, Thaddeus. This character partially inspired by Livia Soprano, Tony's mother.<br/>\n<br/>\nCharacters attached to Jeff<br/>\n<br/>\nSophie (TROUBLE) - Jeff's on-again/off again girlfriend, played by Euan. Younger than him, she is a free spirit, a proto-hippie. Lately she's been getting involved in some weird group called the Greater Universe something something. Her parents are rich and give them some financial support.<br/>\n<br/>\nBruce Howell (SOCIAL) - Jeff's brother, played by Paul. Bruce is a straight-laced, suit-wearing banker who lives in a nice suburban house with his wife and two adorable children. The white sheep of the family.<br/>\n<br/>\nWesley (MONEY) - Jeff's Agent. Competent, but very money-focused compared to Jeff. Always willing to sacrifice creative integrity for money, which drives Jeff nuts.<br/>\n<br/>\nGreater Universe Institute (WEIRD) - a cultish group along the lines of Scientology or the Moonies, played by Ben. They put out good vibes and vague spiritualism. Sophie's been going to their meetings recently.<br/>\n<br/>\nSince Jeff got more Author dice than Gosling he purchases some additional characters.<br/>\n<br/>\nKitty Howell (SOCIAL) - Bruce's wife, played by Richie. Kitty is as straight-laced and comfortable as her husband.<br/>\n<br/>\nHooker J. Stephens (MONEY) - Sophie's father, played by Paul. Mr Stephens is a powerful man in Californian social and political life, a patriotic and red-blooded American. Although he doesn't fully understand why Jeff would waste his money-making potential to be an author, he appreciates his rugged individualism and the stabilising effect Jeff has on his wild daughter Sophie.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Secrets and <strike>Lies</strike> WEIRD</b><br/>\n<br/>\nWe worked out the Secrets for each NPC between us while the Authors took turns leaving the room.

However, most of the scenes focus on one of the two Authors.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene One</b> - Richie's turn. Widescreen scene.<br/>\nA Widescreen scene is an Author's introduction, laying out the situation he finds himself in. It is opened by the Author's Creator, in this case John.<br/>\nJohn did quite a nice opening bit, describing Gosling sitting in his tiny flat in San Francisco. He's at his desk looking out the window at a playground. The swing squeaks as the wind blows. The ashtray beside him is piled up high.<br/>\nHe hears the commotion of two women yapping as they come up the stairs. Gosling swears; it's his wife and his mother.<br/>\nAlly and Cecilia burst into the room, partway through conversation.<br/>\n"Worthless man! Not like his father," says Cecilia.<br/>\n"Don't you knock?"<br/>\nCecilia lectures him about his manners towards his wife. "Your own wife can walk into a room if she wants!"<br/>\nThey nag him about his unfinished novel and his heavy drinking. He dodges the conversation. "I'm going out!"<br/>\nIgnoring their protests he rushes past them down the stairs. As he leaves the flat he sees a man across the street in a dark brown coat and a fedora. They briefly make eye contact. This should be innocuous but Gosling gets an uneasy feeling. He gets into his car and starts driving across town to a bar.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Two</b> - Ben's turn (Creator for Jeff). Widescreen scene.<br/>\nIt's early afternoon at Jeff R. Howell's ranch, in the outskirts of the city. Jeff is writing on the back porch when he hears a car drive up.<br/>\nIt's a young man in a bad suit who introduces himself as Pippin. Pippin tells Jeff that Sophie has been coming to some meetings of the Greater Universe Institute and has told them some things about Jeff.<br/>\n"From what she tells us, you have a lot of negative energy you're dealing with. You really should come to a meeting."<br/>\n"Not interested." It takes a lot of time for Jeff to get Pippin to leave but before he goes Pippin hands him a business card. The card is all handwritten. Pippin drives off with a friendly wave.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Three</b> - John's turn (Gosling's Creator).<br/>\nGosling arrives at the bar downtown. It's called the Lucky Strike. The barmaid, Lulu, tries to console him with a drink after his treatment from his wife and mother.<br/>\nIn the midst of conversation Lulu lets slip that she saw Gosling's wife drinking up with some men at another bar. Gosling refuses to believe it.<br/>\nGosling's best friend Bud walks in. He banters with Lulu and sits with Gosling.<br/>\n"Why the long face this time? Wife, or mother?"<br/>\n"Both."<br/>\nGosling is also upset that he's having serious writer's block with the story he's writing. He gets progressively drunker.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Four</b> - Elliot's turn (playing Jeff).<br/>\nSophie, played by Euan, squeals up to the ranch. She never was a careful driver. Though their on-again, off-again relationship has recently been off, they're still 'friends'. She invites him to the new Charlton Heston movie. Jeff agrees and they head out to dinner.<br/>\nAt the restaurant, Jeff asks about Pippin and this odd group Sophie's been hanging with lately. She tells him they've helped her a lot with her spiritual needs and that they can help him, too. She tries to persuade him to come to a meeting.<br/>\nThis starts a TROUBLE conflict. Elliot gets a partial success. Jeff is able to talk his way out of meeting the Greater Universe.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Five</b> - Paul's turn<br/>\nJeff returns home to find a message from Sophie's father, Hooker J. Stephens, to come to his ranch the next day. Since Sophie's parents provide some financial support (Stephens is in Jeff's MONEY quadrant) he does so.<br/>\nJeff arrives to find Hooker J. Stephens taking potshots at birds. Stephens and Jeff chat about Sophie and Jeff tells him he's concerned about this group she's been meeting with. Stephens worries that his daughter's falling in with 'those damn Communists.' However, he has other business to discuss.<br/>\nHooker J. Stephens has been heavily involved in his friend Ronald Reagan's gubernatorial campaign. Since Reagan comes from Hollywood, the campaign has come up with the idea to fund films with patriotic themes that subtly promote Reagan. Since Jeff is a writer, he can help with the scripts, but it would take time away from his novels. Jeff doesn't want to do it, but daddy Stephens is a source of cash for him and Sophie. Hmm, looks like a MONEY conflict...<br/>\n<br/>\nHere was the first major stumbling point for our playtest. Since Stephens is in Jeff's MONEY quadrant, he was brought in to start a conflict about money. However, when we got to the specifics of the money conflicts in the rules, we realised they're incredibly narrowly defined. A MONEY conflict is where an Author sits down and writes a novel which will bring him money. You can't just resolve any old conflict that happens to involve money. We had a very long discussion on how to resolve the scene - it didn't get too heated but it was very frustrating.<br/>\nWe initially thought that we'd categorised Hooker J. Stephens wrong, that he should be TROUBLE rather than money because he's taking Jeff away from his writing. However what we eventually decided was to have Jeff just refuse to take the propaganda gig, which meant Stephens' money would dry up and Jeff wouldn't be able to pay his rent. He would then have to sit and hack out a quick short story that could be easily sold. Jeff could then start the real MONEY conflict.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Five, continued</b> - Jeff writes a short story<br/>\nMoney conflicts are quite detailed and involve planning out a story's characters and themes. Note this is not the story of the game, it's a story-within-a-story that the Author character writes. The players then take the role of characters in the story and act it out.<br/>\nElliot decides to have Jeff write a hard sci-fi story set on a space station in a society where religion has been outlawed. The two protagonists are based on his brother Bruce and his wife Kitty. As people of faith, they are on the run from an oppressive government.<br/>\nThe story is influenced by themes of McCarthyism, Communist societies and the Hollywood blacklists. Obviously Jeff is bringing in things from his personal life as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnfortunately at this point we were well over time and we had to finish the session with the story only just started. We have had a second session that continues the story, I will post the AP soon. Myself and the other players will likely have some more detailed thoughts but here are a few brief thoughts on this session:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Character creation was really fun. Everyone really got into it and we made some interesting relationships.<br/>\n- I was really concerned that the Secrets for the NPCs were a bad idea, however in play I think they worked fine. Having the two Authors take turns to leave the room while everyone else discussed the Secrets kept them from being too wacky or repetitive. After the second session only a few Secrets have been revealed so we've yet to fully explore how they'll go in play.<br/>\n- With six players, I was also concerned the game wouldn't work to keep everyone engaged, but in the first session we seemed to do okay. Second session was different unfortunately but we'll go into that later.<br/>\n- Only five of us had a turn; Euan missed out. He seemed okay with it but the scenes in general took a long time.<br/>\n- Most of the scenes just sort of meandered along without getting much of a conflict going. The final scene started with a very clear conflict in mind but it turned out to be the wrong conflict for the rules.<br/>\n- The games aim for a 'laid back' vibe where the players play out a scene and play out conflicts where they find them, but my initial impression is that doesn't fit a setup where each NPC fits a clearly defined conflict category, and the conflicts are narrowly defined and specific to each category.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt is a very interesting game and we definitely enoyed some aspects to it. I hope this AP has been useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366157">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366157/#Comment_366157" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T21:58:51+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  9:58PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Paul and Richie. That's an excellent amount of detail and it is definitely useful: it would now be fair to say I'm consistently getting feedback about needing simplify the number of choices players need to make to scenes start, and about the setup fighting against the laidbackness of the game.<br><br>I won't say too much more at the moment - I'm keen to hear more about your second session and why it was problematic. After that I'd like to ask some questions to get to the root of any issues I'm not clear about.<br><br>And I really appreciate your group playing two sessions of the game. You're the first group in the world to do that, as far as I know! And thank you for playtesting, in general - it's a hard thing to take on a game that is far from perfect, so good on you for doing it and being willing to work through conversations like that stuff about Money scenes. It's really important to me to figure out all the speed-bumps in the rules that stop groups from having a consistently good time, and this is definitely going to help me do it.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366178">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SmZA" title="SmZA"><img alt="SmZA" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SmZA">SmZA</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366178/#Comment_366178" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T04:14:41+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  4:14AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Session Two</b><br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Five</b> - Jeff's story continues<br/>\nJeff has now named his two main characters Bryce and Kathy (no relation to his brother and sister-in-law Bruce and Kitty). He has also given a name to the evil overlord figure who's hunting them down, along with all other religious people: Booker, not at all inspired by his father-in-law Hooker J. Stephens.<br/>\nWe now volunteer to play the characters - Richie is Bryce, Ben is Kathy, Paul is Booker.<br/>\nIn the story, Booker has sent shock troops to the space station Bryce and Kathy are hiding on. He knows they're there because he got a tip-off from an informant named Sorphie, played by Euan; the player who coincidentally plays Jeff's girlfriend Sophie.<br/>\nBryce and Kathy meet with others in their religious group. Some want to escape, some want to storm the space station's control room, some want to vent the air out and suffocate the shock troops.<br/>\nBooker's commander on the space station, Colonel Wozzer (played by John) is closing in on their position. The group decide to storm the bridge. They have trouble getting access because the doors are blocked by space mushroom farmers.<br/>\nIt has to be said we got a little out of control. Jeff started writing a hard sci-fi and ended up with a somewhat silly space opera. Choice quote: "Don't you hate it when your characters come alive on the page?"<br/>\nElliot now rolls dice and Jeff succeeds in writing his story. He gets a money point. He calls the story "Unicorns of the Sun."<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Six</b> - Elliot's turn. Sidekick scene.<br/>\nA sidekick scene is where the two Authors get a chance to meet.<br/>\nGosling is feverishly writing in one of the city's biggest and best public libraries, where a lot of authors hang out. Jeff comes in and they chat about Gosling's difficulties with his novel. They are shushed by the Librarian (played by Paul) who is not, as someone suggested, an orangutan. She's a stern older lady who nevertheless is very helpful in obtaining rare books.<br/>\nJohn the Creator intervenes with some Weirdness and Gosling sees the man in the brown coat and fedora watching him. He freaks out and runs for the door. However, he's taken one of the Library's rare books with him. The Librarian shouts at Eric (Euan), the burly security guard, and the big man casually puts out his huge arm to clothesline Gosling.<br/>\nGosling (Richie) rolls a success. He gets an Author dice.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Seven</b> - Richie's turn. Widescreen scene.<br/>\nRichie nominates Ben to narrate. Gosling is running from the Library, and passes a dark alleyway. A dark figure pounces out and accosts him.<br/>\nThe man, played by John, is dishevelled and crazed. He shakes Gosling by the shoulders. He tells him he escaped from some shadowy agency and that they're now after Gosling.<br/>\nGosling is skeptical. Richie decides to play it as a conflict, ie. roll to decide if Gosling is convinced by the man or not. He gets two successes, but rather than have Gosling succeed and therefore walk away from the man, he spends one on getting the Creator (John) to reveal a Secret.<br/>\nGosling now believes that he's being chased by the same agency that this strange man describes, but he also learns something shocking.<br/>\n"They're onto you, Gosling. Have been for a long time. It's your wife, man!"<br/>\n"Ally? That can't be true!"<br/>\n"Fraid so, she's been informing on you. You can never return home."<br/>\nRichie spends his second success on Narrating A Fact about his Author. He decides that Gosling is now part of an underground resistance group who think there is a government mind control conspiracy.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe discuss what to call the group. Someone suggests the Pink Panthers, inspired by the Black Panthers. Euan starts singing the Pink Panther theme, but it's not the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OPc7MRm4Y8" rel="nofollow">tune we all know and love</a>. He claims it is from a TV show and it goes <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bii-PIGprv8" rel="nofollow">"Have you ever seen a panther that is pink?"</a> None of us believe this is true but we all think it is hilarious and we spend about five minutes grilling Euan about it. "Even if that theme does exist, why would you hum that and not the incredibly famous iconic Mancini version?"<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Eight</b> - Ben's turn. Widescreen scene for Jeff.<br/>\nJeff's been invited to Bruce and Kitty's house in the suburbs. Bruce (Paul) offers him a beer and they chat but Kitty and the children are noticeably absent. Eventually Jeff gets Bruce to spill that Kitty is very upset with Jeff. She had heard from a friend in her sewing circle that Jeff had written an unflattering sci-fi story with a character obviously based on her.<br/>\nKitty (Richie) returns home; she'd forgotten her coat, and she's clearly still upset. Jeff starts to talk to her like an understanding human being but Paul reminds Elliot that the game is set in the early 1960s.<br/>\n"Kitty, honey, you're being irrational. Why don't you have a lie down and let us men work this out?"<br/>\nKitty, Jeff and Bruce continue their argument and there is a Conflict that Elliot wins. Bruce, annoyed that Kitty won't play the obedient wife, storms out, leaving Jeff and Kitty alone.<br/>\nElliot spent his success on getting Kitty to reveal her Secret. Kitty is upset not because Jeff wrote a story about her, but because she was hurt to think he views her in a negative light.<br/>\nKitty is in love with Jeff, and has been for a long time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366179">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SmZA" title="SmZA"><img alt="SmZA" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SmZA">SmZA</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366179/#Comment_366179" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-09T04:43:16+00:00" title="March  9, 2012  4:43AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 9, 2012 5:08AM by SmZA.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Some notes on the second session:<br/>\n<br/>\n- Some of the issues we had were not the game's fault and can and do happen with any session. Two of us were very late due to public transport problems, everyone had been busy and hadn't read the rules since last week, we'd misplaced the character sheets and relationship maps (lucky I had my session notes) and there was just generally more cross-talking and fidgeting going on. The vibe was just a bit off.<br/>\n- Only three and a half turns this time.<br/>\n- We were in a different venue and seated in a different order to last time. This meant we again skipped Euan without realising.<br/>\n- Scenes this session mostly involved just two or three characters and there was a lot of sitting on the sidelines, especially for John and Euan. While the rules do encourage people to jump in and contribute extra characters sometimes it feels hard to do so without stepping on a good established scene.<br/>\n- The 'wrong' Pink Panther song was the funniest thing I'd heard in our sessions since the time we all got chased around a forest inside a caterpillar by a demon octopus in Stormbringer (Hi, Russell!)<br/>\n- We seemed to have a slightly better handle on getting good Conflicts and I liked the way Richie and Elliot could spend their successes on having their Authors fail but gain a Secret instead.<br/>\n- Jeff's story (Unicorns of the Sun) went off the rails; we do get a bit gonzo if there are no rules guidelines or GM to reign us in. It took up a long time at the start of the session and it didn't have much impact on the larger story besides getting Kitty offended.<br/>\n- Despite our issues, it wasn't nearly as disastrous as <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15571" rel="nofollow">our attempt at Capes</a>.<br/>\n- After the session we agreed we all need to fully read the rules if we're going to continue the playtest next week, and give feedback here or internally. There's definitely some promise in the game, I hope we can be helpful in improving it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_366477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366477/#Comment_366477" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-10T19:02:47+00:00" title="March 10, 2012  7:02PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2012 7:03PM by Steve_Hickey.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the scene write-ups, Paul.

There are other "off screen situations" which are more like somewhere between colour and situations. Gosling has a bit of writer's block, his relationships with his wife and mother are strained (to say the least). Jeff's girlfriend is in a cult and he's not that into her, but her dad i bankrolling him. So these features have not really played an active role in the story yet. I think the onus is on us to produce interesting situations through the rules. In regards to time vs story question there does seem to be a lot of time spent and not that much story generated, when you look at it that way. I'll have a think about this aspect.<br><br>2. I think the Audience role is tricky as it could bend/break the "my dude" convention a lot of games have. That being said we are using it, our group is pretty good at experimenting, there isn't anyone in our group at the moment who isn't interested in trying new games and ideas. I'm not sure how to tackle the role of the Audience. I guess there needs to be emphasis on the collaborative nature of the story generation through gameplay. It's something I'll keep in mind for next sesh.<br><br>In regards to suggestions for improvement/ rules I think I need to play some more before I can do that.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_367293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367293/#Comment_367293" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-13T16:35:33+00:00" title="March 13, 2012  4:35PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wanted to clarify something: from looking at the Jeff vs. Stephens conflict, it sounds like I need to be a lot clearer about when Money scenes happen. Is it fair to say your issues with Money scenes were about when they happen (rather than about what to do in a Money scene)? <br> <br>I'll try and clarify what the rules currently are, but I also want to acknowledge the confusion you had (and that I'll have to think more deeply about whether I can make the rules more intuitive).<br> <br>At the moment, Money scenes are pretty damn specific. They happen either (a) when the Author\u2019s player starts a scene that shows the Author writing a story, or (b) when the Author is in a conflict that needs money to resolve.<br> <br>That means it <b>doesn\u2019t matter which quadrant an NPC</b> is in: <br>- an NPC from the Money quadrant doesn't necessarily trigger a Money conflict (eg. your agent could be be arguing you need to come to a networking event, when you really need to spend time with your emotionally-distressed son) (Jeff vs Stephens fits into this category)<br>- any NPC from any quadrant can trigger a Money conflict (eg. your husband can tell you that you're all going to get evicted if you can't make this week's rent)<br> <br>So why are the quadrants there, then? I'm using them as creative prompts to help the group design the setting (and to indicate what types of conflicts are likely in this genre), and I'm using them to help define which reset scenes are used.<br> <br>(Tangent alert: Here's a little bit of history that's outside this discussion but could help explain your confusion. Originally, authors used to have four different ratings (one for each quadrant) instead of a single pool of Author dice. That meant there could be four different types of conflicts. I moved beyond that during my redesign, to simplify the game.)<br><br> <br><b>TL,DR</b>: If a conflict involves anything other than needing money to resolve your troubles, you just roll the Author\u2019s Dice (regardless of what quadrant the NPC is in).<br><br><br>I'm also aware that I can get quite detail-focused when I'm looking for feedback. And I know the list of feedback-questions in the rules is pretty extensive.

Paul and Euan took over as Creators.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Nine</b> - Paul's turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nPaul has now taken on the role of Creator for Elliot's Author Jeff R. Howell.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff, still mulling over the revelation that his brother's wife is in love with him, walks into his Agent's office.<br/>\nBetsy, the buxom blonde receptionist, greets him with her pleasant drawl. "Oh, Jeff. Ah hope you've been keeping well. Go on in, Wes won't mind!"<br/>\nJeff doesn't react to the flirtatious twinkle in her eye. He's had enough trouble from the fairer sex today. He walks on through Wes's door.<br/>\nWes is shaving and barely looks up as he greets Jeff. Their relationship has never been close, though Wes respects Jeff as a good earner, when he's not getting caught up in such trivial matters as artistic integrity.<br/>\nJeff, whose novel "Unicorns of the Sun" has just been sold, wants some advice on what to write next. Wes doesn't have much to offer at the moment but mentions the Republican Party have approached him looking for screenwriters to write propaganda films for Ronald Reagan. Jeff groans inwardly.<br/>\nThere is a knock on the door and Betsy comes in with hot coffee. Jeff accepts politely, Wes slaps her on the butt as she giggles and leaves.<br/>\n<br/>\nNo conflict from this scene, just a little warm-up and it introduced the character of Wes.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Ten</b> - Euan's turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nEuan has now taken on the role of Creator for Richie's Author T. Alfred Gosling.<br/>\n<br/>\nLast session Richie decided that Gosling had joined an underground movement that believes there is a government mind control conspiracy. It turns out they are literally underground - hiding in the sewer system of San Francisco.<br/>\nJack, the dishevelled old guy who had brought Gosling into the fold - is ranting once again about the conspiracy. Gosling has heard it at least five times before. Gosling tries not to be rude but he has to interrupt.<br/>\n"Jack, we'll have to talk on this later. Where are the others? B.J., Lucy?"<br/>\nHe tries to say the name Lucy nonchalantly, but she is his main concern. Since joining the group he has grown very attached to the sweet and intelligent founding member of the organisation. He has totally forgotten his wife Ally, who had been spying on him for the government for years.<br/>\n"Lucy? She's off gathering intelligence. We need to know more about this conspiracy, man. It has its tendrils infiltrating every corner of..."<br/>\nGosling interrupts him again. Besides Lucy, what he wants most of all right now is to write. He tries to convince Jack to go find him a typewriter.<br/>\nCONFLICT - Gosling wants a typewriter<br/>\nRichie rolls only one success. He could choose to get a partial result but instead he decides to 'purchase' Lucy as a full-fledged NPC. We take a little time to flesh her out:<br/>\nLucy is in Gosling's Social quadrant. She founded the group along with her former boyfriend; the couple are no longer together. She is well-respected by the other members.<br/>\nWe also had Richie leave the room so we could think up her SECRET. Since this was our last session, I'll reveal it now: Lucy's ex-boyfriend is a government mole who's been reporting on them for years. On some level, Lucy knows this, but she can't bring herself to admit it.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Eleven</b> - Richie's turn.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe had a lot of discussion with this scene. Richie just wanted Gosling to sit down and write a story, like Jeff had done previously. But, using rules as written, it turned out to be very difficult. We could have had him just start writing as a colour scene, but to actually use the full rules for writing a story you have to have a Money conflict. We couldn't see an easy way to just launch straight into one on an Author's turn.<br/>\nFrom what I could tell, the 'legal' way to do it would be (1) Author nominates another player to start the scene (2) That player narrates a scene that railroads the Author into a situation where they need money (3) Author can then start a Money conflict that allows him to write.<br/>\nAfter some discussion back and forth we ignored the rules and allowed Gosling to just go ahead and write.<br/>\n<br/>\nGosling has been inspired. His experience of the last week in running from a pervasive government conspiracy has ended his writer's block and he is full of ideas. Unfortunately he couldn't get a typewriter so he's cramping his hand with a pen scrawling pages and pages of barely legible manuscript. His only light comes from a kerosene lamp.<br/>\nGosling writes a story set in the modern day (modern day 60s) where cyborgs have infiltrated society. There is a main character based on Lucy who bravely fights the cyborg menace and a next door neighbour based on Gosling's mother who threatens to turn her in. The story was fun to write and act out but it didn't have an impact on the main story so I'm cutting the description short.<br/>\nCONFLICT - Richie rolls the dice and gets one success, translating to one money point. Gosling has written a novel, which he calls "Blue Jardine."<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Twelve</b> - Elliot's turn<br/>\n<br/>\nWe must have forgotten our first scene between Jeff and Wes because this continues directly from last session's scene where Kitty tells Jeff she loves him. I guess we could retcon it as a flashback.<br/>\n<br/>\nJeff is stunned. He didn't ask for this; Bruce is his brother, and he feels no attraction for Kitty. Kitty, who is stifled by her humdrum existence as a suburban housewife, feels Jeff is her only ticket out. She pleads with him to love her.<br/>\nThere's a noise at the door; Bruce has returned, and he's heard everything. Weirdly, behind him is Sophie, Jeff's girlfriend, and Pippin, the guy from the Greater Universe Institute.<br/>\nIt all gets a bit messy. Kitty wants Jeff, Jeff rebuffs her, Bruce is angry, Sophie sticks her nose in and Pippin tries to get everyone to come to a cult meeting so they can heal their bad vibes.<br/>\nCONFLICT - with so many conflicts to choose from, Elliot decides to have Jeff roll to convince Sophie to leave the cult. He gets only a partial success; she doesn't leave but she is wavering.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Thirteen</b> - Paul's turn<br/>\n<br/>\nGosling's been missing for more than a week. His oldest friend, Bud, is very concerned. He knocks on Alfred's door and speaks to his wife Ally; she hasn't seen him either but is not in the least bit helpful. Bud also approaches Lulu, the barmaid who normally serves them, and Mavis Carnegie, a newly introduced character who is Gosling's Agent.<br/>\nCONFLICT - Gosling doesn't want to be found, but people in his life are looking for him. Richie rolls but gets no successes. Somehow, Bud manages to track him down.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Fourteen</b> - Euan's turn<br/>\n<br/>\nBud and Gosling confront each other in the sewer but before they can talk there is a commotion outside. Jack is shouting. "It's them! The government has found us!"<br/>\nWhether they'd been tipped off by Lucy's ex-boyfriend, or whether it was Bud nosing around that led them to the sewer, we'll never know. Gosling gathers up his manuscript and writing equipment and they leg it.<br/>\nTheir path is blocked by three government men with Tommy guns. Richie debates whether he should roll a conflict right now but decides it is more interesting to let Gosling, Bud and the others be caught and continue the scene.<br/>\nGosling and Bud are arrested and taken into custody. Gosling is given one phone call; he phones Mavis Carnegie, his Agent, who can get him a lawyer.<br/>\nMavis is a fast-talking up-and-comer from the East Coast who is impressed by Gosling's recent output and wants him to write more and help her build her agency. She's played by Paul.<br/>\nCONFLICT - Richie rolls to get Gosling out of jail; since his recent writing is relevant he spends the money point he earned. He gets two successes.<br/>\nRichie could spend both of them in getting Gosling out of jail entirely but he decides it's more interesting to get just a partial success and 'buy' a new NPC.<br/>\nHe decides that Gosling will be allowed his freedom if he can pass a psychiatric evaluation. The new NPC is the psychiatrist, Dr. Jofir Trobloski. He falls in Gosling's Trouble quadrant and his name sounds a bit like You Fear Trouble. He has a Russian accent and is played by Elliot.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Fifteen</b> - Richie's turn<br/>\n<br/>\nNot much happens in this scene - Gosling, Lucy, Mavis Carnegie and Dr. Trobloski are in the back of a paddy wagon being driven to the Doctor's asylum. There was no conflict and I can't remember what they talked about. Elliot and Paul had fun speaking in Dr. Trobloski's and Mavis Carnegie's accents.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Scene Sixteen</b> - Elliot's turn<br/>\n<br/>\nGosling is lying on the couch in a stereotypical psychiatrists' office. Dr. Trobloski is seated and smoking a pipe. There is a third seat that is conspicuously empty.<br/>\nAfter some time, Trobloski says, "Finally we get a chance to talk one-on-one."<br/>\nGosling stares dead-eyed at the wall.<br/>\nTrobloski drones on about his theories, and points out the empty seat. He says he has a surprise visitor for Alfred.<br/>\nHe buzzes someone in. It's Gosling's mother.<br/>\nWithout so much as a hello she berates Gosling for going missing, for abandoning his wife, for leaving a mother sick with worry, for getting involved with Communists, for being nothing like his poor dead father and for being generally worthless. Gosling just stares ahead.<br/>\nSomewhere at the edge of his hearing, below the nagging of his Mother and the droning of the Doctor, he can hear a strange noise. It's a faint buzzing or murmur, and sometimes he can catch snippets of conversation.<br/>\nThe room is bugged; the Government is monitoring every word.<br/>\nCONFLICT - Richie rolls Story dice as Gosling is in battle with the weird. Appropriately, he gets no successes.<br/>\nGosling is trapped. A broken man, he awaits his fate.<br/>\n<br/>\n--- END ---                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_367716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SmZA" title="SmZA"><img alt="SmZA" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SmZA">SmZA</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/367716/#Comment_367716" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-14T19:36:02+00:00" title="March 14, 2012  7:36PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Secrets</b><br/>\n<br/>\nJust for the heck of it, and because this was our last session, here are all the secrets of the NPCs.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Gosling's</b> mother Cecilia (TROUBLE) forged her mortgage using his name.

(again), though I can't believe you left out Blue Jardine, looking forward to the paperback release xD, although it made me realise that coming up with original sci-fi is far from easy.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Steve Hickey</cite><br>- What did you like?</br></blockquote>\nI love the setting. I love the premise. I love the organic emergent shared storytelling. I love the no prep. I love the attempt at enfolding narrative-metanarrative.\n<blockquote>- What did you not like</blockquote>\nI didn't really dislike anything but there do seem to be too many different types of choices...\n<blockquote><br>- What confused you?<br/></br></blockquote>\nWhich can be very confusing. The different Scene types and when they are allowed to be used. The different quadrants and when they come into play, though this was addressed earlier in this thread. What purpose does the "bringing in new NPCs rules" serve? We found it kind of got in the way of the fiction a bit, not quite getting what was a kosher move.<br><br><br>Suggestions<br><br>I think the stories should overlap and intertwine more. I'm not sure if we missed something but there doesn't seem to be a naturalistic way for the Authors' stories to riff off each other in the rules. Same goes for the narrative-metanarrative relationship. I feel like there should be a way for the Authors' fictional stories to bleed into their "real lives" and vice-versa. This feels like some sort of degradation of sanity mechanic, but that's just a thought that would apply to the Dickean type I played and not necessarily other Author types. But I think there was some kind of consensus at out table that there could be a lot more interweaving of plot lines, though this does seem like a tall order mechanically.<br><br>The other thing I think the rules really need is more flow. That is a procedural flow that is easy to follow in order to support the fiction, so players have a good sense of how to use the rules to keep the "fiction ball" rolling. We found the system a little stop-start which is probably the main thing that slowed us down. Even once we had a decent feel for the rules we tended to get a bit bogged down in arguments over minutiae as to which was the "right" way to go according to the rules.<br><br>It seemed to work much better with the suggested four players, rather than the six we tried the first two sessions, but I also think our understanding of the game improved a lot which probably affected this as well.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
