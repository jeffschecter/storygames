(this is exalted, effectively fantasy superheros)<br/><br/>Their stated purpose is to move to the biggest, most corrupt/intrigue filled/wealthiest city in the world, and take it over... And i have nothing for how to gratifyingly do the slow takeover of cities... Think of how Batman "took over" gotham from the criminals,  Basically a more political/social way? A way of tracking a rise to power which would have interesting hooks for the players. Taking control of the dock district, gaining the support of the blacksmith guild etc.<br/><br/>Has anyone here had experience with a similar king of game experience?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437619/#Comment_437619" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T04:13:30+00:00" title="August 22, 2014  4:13AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The most similar thing to that I experienced in playing World of Darkness Games. Where it often is centered on a city and the characters are building a power base.<br/><b>Dammnation City</b> for <i>Vampire: The Requiem</i> and <b>Block by Bloody Block</b> for <i>Hunter: The Vigil</i> would be books about that theme. You can kind of feel the influence of the GTA computer games in them and at least in Block by Bloody Block they are directly mentioned as an inspiration. A split of the city into different iconic districts is one game mechanic that is lifted from GTA, another is having factions and a stat for the characters standing with them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin" title="Joe_McGuffin"><img alt="Joe_McGuffin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe_McGuffin">Joe_McGuffin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437633/#Comment_437633" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T09:24:03+00:00" title="August 22, 2014  9:24AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 22, 2014 9:24AM by Joe_McGuffin.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I haven't used them yet, but Reign's Company rules are fairly easy to overlay onto other games, and on a read-though I quite like the look of them.

Set up a relationship map with a bunch of power players (five is a great number). These PPs have all kinds of relationships to each other. Some hate each other, some are allied, some have a fragile truce, etc. Then add some details that undermine these relationships. The ones at war have children who are in love (Romeo and Juliet-style), the allied ones have difficulty splitting up the drug money, etc. Also think a bit about the goals of these PPs. Don't let them all be in it just for money and power. Someone's in love, another wants to create a safe haven free from corruption, yet another needs to find her missing brother or avenge a slight. Now reveal all of this to the players as they scout out the territory. Don't try to hide the information, but don't throw it at them. Let them find answers when they talk to people.<br/><br/>Now it's up to the characters to play the factions against each other, join a faction, take it over, or create a new one and make a stir in the relationship map. Let the relationships and goals guide you in deciding how the factions react to whatever the characters do. And let them react dramatically.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437643">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437643/#Comment_437643" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T12:30:27+00:00" title="August 22, 2014 12:30PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fish tank?<br/>I actually had both damnation city and block by block, and they seem to have a lot of stuff that leans towards important NPC, relationships between them and the player characters, and the characters jumping in and messing stuff up <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Sounds like I will do something like this - define the parts of the city, and the bigwigs in that city and what the status quo is before the PCs come barging in <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_437645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437645/#Comment_437645" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-22T15:42:07+00:00" title="August 22, 2014  3:42PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 23, 2014 9:45PM by David_Berg.">edited August 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For a long and satisfying takeover campaign, you might want to consider a pyramid rather than a web.  Not that a web wouldn't work!  But a pyramid might provide a clearer sense of progress.<br/><br/>Example: the city is ostensibly ruled by a council of merchants and nobles.  They usually vote on city matters according to their own status and financial incentives as one might expect.  However, there are certain odd exceptions, leading other interested parties, such as the city's major organized crime family, to wonder what else is going on.  Quid pro quo backroom deals?  Intervention from the distant emperor or another third party?  The criminals like to act like they own the city, but in reality they can't compete with the power of the council.  The council, in turn, is manipulated by a powerful demigod (since this is Exalted).  So when the player characters enter the city, they get to work their way up the food chain, from the low-level officials to the mafia to the ruling elite to the demigod, none of which can be optimally accessed without info or resources from a lower tier.<br/><br/>Or maybe think through what it'd be like to depose the Prince in a good Vampire supplement.<br/><br/>Just an idea.  Depending on how you like to GM, a more flexible arrangement, where hierarchy isn't established until it's needed in play, might be more fun.<br/><br/>Edited to add: from what I've read, <i>Conspiracy of Shadows</i> has good guidance for inventing antagonist pyramids as GM.  I can't think of any other published systems off the top of my head.  If anyone else can, I'd love to hear 'em.  "Take over a place" is one of my favorites in gaming!  I've only ever done it with a ton of ad lib, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/makrdp" title="makrdp"><img alt="makrdp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/makrdp">makrdp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437704/#Comment_437704" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T09:17:01+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  9:17AM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Seconding Reign's faction rules here.

Of course you can then link the institutions by a web as well. You should write up institutional agendas as well.  (Example: The night guard is tasked with upholding the law, while the palace guard is tasked with protecting the king and they traditionally do not get along with each others. But on a personal level that can differ)<br/><br/>You could bring in a bit of an economic level too. Taking some inspiration for A Quiet Year and Apocalypse World you could define what the city (or each faction) needs and who controls it. So part of taking over the city could be solving those needs and breaking monopolies. Or it could be about cutting of something the city needs to male rivals look bad or destroy their bases of power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_437739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/437739/#Comment_437739" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-08-25T19:15:26+00:00" title="August 25, 2014  7:15PM">August 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call.
