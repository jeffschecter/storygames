However, there's some brilliant people here and I'd like to get there ideas.<br/><br/>If you haven't heard about it yet, check out<br/> <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/105134/risk-legacy" rel="nofollow">Risk Legacy</a>.  You permanently mark the board, place stickers, use cards that you can never use again.  The psychology and its effect on strategy is interesting to ponder.<br/><br/>How can this idea of permanence be incorporated in other games?<br/><br/>My ideas:<br/><br/>-In Mechaton, destroyed mechs are completely broken apart and lost for good.  You can't field that same design again, maybe a similar design but it must have some differences.<br/><br/>-Apocalypse World playbooks can never be chosen again once someone takes one<br/><br/>-If you play Empire of Dust you can never start over and next time you play must abide by the map and faction changes.  You can only ever have one Autumnstar and if he blows up the world...well...<br/><br/>(By the way, I would love to see the Empire of Dust map expanded and someone do a Living Campaign where you could upload changes to the map based on your campaign.  Basically Jason Morningstar's big campaign idea but using the EoD map which already has conquest and change built in.  You'd also have to share Unique Traits in EoD so there would have to be more.  Hell, if the game was more popular I would organize this somehow).<br/><br/>-I would love to see a boardgame series where the new game expanded upon the outcome in the previous game.  Think Axis and Allies, keep the outcome and you buy Axis and Allies World War 3 which uses your previous board and ending territory with some new twists (alliances shift, new powers rise, etc.).<br/><br/>-Dominion where the winner of the game chooses a card which is removed from play for all future plays.  You keep track of wins and whoever reaches a pre-defined number of wins first is the victor.  Or you play hardcore and go till the game breaks itself (no victory cards or money left or whatever).  Whoever has the most wins at that point is the victor.<br/><br/>The strategy of removing cards which don't aid your play-style is interesting.  I'd get rid of Saboteur first goddamnit.<br/><br/>-A mega-resistance campaign organized online where each game is a resistance cell attempting to complete their missions.  Missions are handed out by a single leader or a chain of command and you must perform those missions.  This could be done in chapters with groups having to take on new missions with special rules.  Spy or Resistance wins are recorded and whoever wins the most total across all the participating games wins the campaign.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340605">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340605/#Comment_340605" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T09:04:28+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  9:04AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds interesting. I think to a certain extent, RPGs already have a bit of the permanency aspect in them already, but it's interesting to see the concept applied to board games and such. I mean, I've played more than one campaign set in the world of a previous campaign, where the actions of the players from last time have had lasting changes. On a more fundamental level than that, the very idea of a campaign implies permanency. If you use up a limited resource or kill an NPC, they aren't coming back next session- your actions have made an impact. <br/><br/>The big difference I guess is that in RPGs you have player-moderated permanence. There's nothing physically stopping you from retconning something from a previous game or something, as opposed to in risk legacy where you are physically altering the board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340606/#Comment_340606" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T09:04:59+00:00" title="August 26, 2011  9:04AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kevin Allen Jr's Sweet Agatha is probably the most prominent use of permanency in story games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340625/#Comment_340625" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-26T11:12:29+00:00" title="August 26, 2011 11:12AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I brought up Sweet Agatha when discussing this on RPG.net as the idea of permanently altering objects is not some brand new thing with Risk Legacy.<br/><br/>Stephen - those are good points but I'm wondering how to extend that permanency in RPGs.  For instance, in Empire of Dust there's traits you can take where only one character in the world can have them.  They're cool unique things like being the antichrist (The Autumnstar) or hunted by the church for betraying an important religious law.  There's a big difference between taking one of those and playing a campaign knowing next time we play we could restart and someone could take one of those traits again since it's a new campaign.  There's nothing enforcing that permanency as you have a choice to ignore it.<br/><br/>You can't ignore Risk Legacy's permanency without shelling out more money or cheating (making the changes non permanent like not actually stickering the board or whatever).  If we played Empire of Dust knowing that if you choose that trait then that's it, no one can choose it again, then the psychology of your choice is totally different.  There's no accountability or enforcement of permanency in RPGs.  <br/><br/>And, yes, not all of my suggestions really dealt with enforcing permanency but some of them sprang from this idea and I felt like they warranted inclusion in the discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
