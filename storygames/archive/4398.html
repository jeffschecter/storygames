What is missing?  What did you like?  That sort of stuff.  <br/>\n<br/>\nHere's the link:  "Risusiverse: Wiki-based RPG":http://risusiverse.wetpaint.com/page/Wiki-based+RPG<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks in advance.<br/>\n<br/>\nLarry                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99280/#Comment_99280" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-26T13:48:50+00:00" title="September 26, 2007  1:48PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One guideline in our wiki-based Amber game (<a href="http://www.skyseastone.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Phases/MainPage" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.skyseastone.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Phases/MainPage</a>) is to be considerate of other people's opportunities to post - not to hog the scene, basically, if you're able to post more often. The actual statement of the rule has varied. We started off with "post only once a day per scene", then it became "unless yours is the only PC in the scene", and now it's "unless the other players whose PCs are in the scene are able to post as frequently as you".<br/><br/>I don't have the original rules in front of me, as they were circulated by email, but one of them was, "if you retcon a scene, don't just remove what someone else has done, put something in its place that you think is better." In practice, we haven't done this (we're a very polite group and everyone's contributions are cool, pretty much).<br/><br/>Another thing that's working well for us is that we have an email list for out-of-character chat, banter and scheming. We also use it to let each other know when we've updated, and we include a link to the updated page (at the request of one of the list lurkers who isn't playing but is watching the game).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_99435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ruminator" title="ruminator"><img alt="ruminator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://homepage.mac.com/unearthed/tumblr/ur_logo.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ruminator">ruminator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99435/#Comment_99435" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-27T05:52:32+00:00" title="September 27, 2007  5:52AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the input.
