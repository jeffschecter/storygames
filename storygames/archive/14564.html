I googled the movie and went to their official site where they say,<br/>\n<br/>\n"Synopsis<br/>\n<br/>\nA MODERN MEDIEVAL SAGA, The Wild Hunt tells the story of Erik Magnusson, a young man who decides to follow his estranged girlfriend Evelyn into a medieval re-enactment game when he discovers that she has been seduced by one of the players.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs the down-to-earth Erik treks deeper into the game in search of his love, he inadvertently disrupts the delicate balance of the make believe fantasy-land.<br/>\n<br/>\nPassions are unleashed. Rules are broken. Reality and fantasy collide. The good-hearted game turns into a tragedy of mythic proportion...<br/>\n<br/>\nCapturing the culture of costume play and the potentially dangerous intersection of real and made-up worlds, The Wild Hunt is a timely and potent comment on the consuming nature of adopting another identity, even within a game, and the modern yearning for ritual."<br/>\n<br/>\nI dunno... yawn? Still rolling eyes. The girl is pretty, so are the costumes. Still makes me sad that this is always the way things go. Poor LARPers don't ever get a break. Imagination is scary everyone. Please don't play pretend as an adult, it will make you a rapist.<br/>\n<br/>\nOK, I'm done.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331625">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331625/#Comment_331625" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T21:00:33+00:00" title="June 25, 2011  9:00PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oy.<br><br>Matt                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331636">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331636/#Comment_331636" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-25T22:56:27+00:00" title="June 25, 2011 10:56PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 25, 2011 10:57PM by Mcdaldno.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen this movie in my local rental place for a few months, and it's got a pretty cover, but I've never picked it up and checked it out.<br><br>Has anyone here actually seen it?

Nicholas Cage isn't exactly playing the white knight in that movie, and only a few of the pornographers depicted in it are involved in making snuff films, but that doesn't make it any less of a demonization of the entire porn industry.<br><br>I haven't seen the film and I'm just reacting to the trailer of course, but even if the movie is super-great, fuck them in the face for making the trailer. Seriously! Would this same premise work with Civil War re-enactors instead of fantasy larpers? Hell no. The idea that dudes in grey coats will go crazy and wreak havoc with their muskets is totally, completely absurd. That trailer says "larping may look fun, but it's full of crazies and when they snap, that shit affects even normal people!" Basically, larping here takes the place of sex and drugs in older horror movies. If you have sex in a car out on lover's lane, the psycho killer's gonna get you. Look back at Nightmare on Elm Street 3 (spoilers): the kid who plays D&amp;D dies, same as the kid who's addicted to heroin.<br><br>Adam, can you maybe bullet point some of the aspects of larping that are portrayed <b>positively</b> in the movie?                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331650">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331650/#Comment_331650" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T02:33:01+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  2:33AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2011 2:35AM by Steve_Hickey.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Johnstone</cite>Would this same premise work with Civil War re-enactors instead of fantasy larpers?

So, in the movie you get the "LARPer Fuck-up", and WE know it's not a bundle package, and the two things come separated. But  the casual watcher who has never played in his life?<br/><br/>EVERY media exposure  RPGs got in the last years (Zero Charisma, Big Bang Theory, The Onion Movie) is located somewhere in that "Silly-Deranged" continuum. I'm not saying movies like this go for a "Jack Chick" impact, but still it's never represented as something you can associate with sanity. AND, Jack Chick-esque  echoes still resonate around.

Really, it's a psychological thriller that takes place at a <i>grandeur nature</i> (this is what LARPing is called in Quebec; it means lifesize scale literally) camp.  It is much more of a critique of humans and our baser tendencies than of LARPing culture.  You should check it out.  It's really a decent little small-budget flick, quite entertaining and engrossing.<br/><br/>Edit: and the director is a tabletop gamer, playing in a long campaign of 3.5, I think.  Here in Quebec, the grandeur nature scene is really widespread and while it's usually not the popular kids who participate, it is still seen as not a whole lot weirder here than being super into circus stuff (which is also pretty popular sub-culture here as evinced by the success of the Cirque du Soleil).  Check out the<a href="http://www.bicolline.org/" rel="nofollow">Bicolline</a> website to see the scale that some of these LARPs operate at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_331915">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331915/#Comment_331915" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-27T12:36:49+00:00" title="June 27, 2011 12:36PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I saw the movie as well, over a year ago while it was doing the film festival circuit.<br/><br/>For positive elements:<br/><br/>The scene is presented as pretty cool. The sets and props all look impressive and make you say "hey, that looks neat and fun" rather than "that looks totally dumb" like some larp pictures and films look. Things look good but realistic - some of the costumes are better than others. But none of them look as silly as some of the costumes in Role Models looked.<br/><br/>Yes, some folks take their fantasy too far and get out of control. But interestingly, the guy who starts off the movie the most lost in the fantasy (the older brother who is spending his morning bathing in the river and invoking Thor) is the one who comes around in the end and integrates back into his life (after a little vengeance murder, but the story is based on Norse epics, so it fits).<br/><br/>And the going crazy stuff is obviously exaggerated for dramatic effect. It's presented in exactly the same way it would if you made a movie about a paintball game where people brought real guns and started shooting (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1205071/" rel="nofollow">which, of course, was made</a>).<br/><br/>Yes, I'm annoyed that, when roleplaying is presented in a movie, it's almost always about the point where fantasy and reality collide in a bad way. It gets old.<br/><br/>But most hobbies are presented in a similar light. The only time I've seen Civil War reinactors on TV shows other than to illustrate a history moment is when they're worked into a murder detective show, and it's that one time when someone brought in a real gun because he either wanted to kill someone or did it on accident and is trying to cover. I've seen that plot happen on multiple detective shows, and I don't even watch those.<br/><br/>If all you knew about the world was what you learned from CSI, you'd think that everyone was about to kill you for the slightest provocation all the time, and the only solution for any problem was murder.

The costumes look cool but not too cool. The style of play is about 95% right, with teams of player factions interacting with each other in character and building up toward a big fight at the end of the weekend. A lot of campaign fantasy live combat larps look extremely similar to how they look in that movie (though they have unusually good buildings, but those are from a real larp group, so that's accurate too). The biggest downside is that the guys go crazy and kill people. The other downside is that they added stunt work to the combat, which makes it much more dangerous than the actual style of combat used in most story-centered fantasy live combat larps - some of the heavy contact games get a little rougher).<br/><br/>Role Models consistently presents larping in a positive light, which is pretty amazing, considering that it's a Hollywood crude comedy. Yes, some characters rip on larpers, but the movie presents them as being in the wrong when they do so, and they all come around in the end. Heck, Oggie even gets the girl! Also, the fighting in the movie is a pretty darn good movie representation of what live combat larp fighting looks like - they didn't throw in lots of rough fighting stunts. The downsides: The style of game, where it's pretty much just pure fighting and you have a persona but you don't have a naturalistic sense of story, you just fight and die and then rest and get up and fight again, is more representative of the heavy combat foam sport games - specifically Darkon, with its factions and magic (and maybe Amtgard, though I'm less familiar with that one). And some of the costumes are really silly, like the aluminum can armor worn at the end.<br/><br/>So if you have someone who is unfamiliar with larp watch those 2 movies and you tell them what parts to take from which, you can give them an excellent sense of what a live combat fantasy campaign larp is like.<br/><br/>And that makes me happy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
