It's the greatest thing ever!"  And then I have other friends who also regularly read and/or watch movies, but who have a lot of criticisms of what they read and watch.  <br/><br/>I'm not sure what conclusions you can draw from this difference, though.  I don't think that one can conclude that the more enthusiastic crowd are superior at finding good media.  Indeed, I'm usually more wary of their recommendations for what I consume.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_369874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369874/#Comment_369874" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T21:04:25+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  9:04PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i think the questions, as they are, are an attempt to broadly establish how invested people are in having an exciting time when they game, as opposed to approaching it as more of a straight-up pastime or amusing activity.<br/>I think Jason can decide for himself whether to share his mysterious purpose ^__^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_369876">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/369876/#Comment_369876" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-28T21:11:40+00:00" title="March 28, 2012  9:11PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Curious about the results.

Here's a breakdown of my personal rpg history in these terms:\n<table><tr><th>Years</th><th>Quality</th></tr><tr><td>90-95</td><td>6/4/7</td></tr><tr><td>95-00</td><td>5/3/6</td></tr><tr><td>00-05</td><td>6/5/7</td></tr><tr><td>05-10</td><td>7/6/9</td></tr><tr><td>10+</td><td>6/7/10</td></tr></table>The recent hike on quality has largely been because of a rise in the quality of the player stock. Or rather, I've switched to a game that seems to work better for many of the local people I play with; OSR-D&amp;D seems to have a stronger appeal to more people in the 15-25 male demography than the Forgista drama games I mostly played through the last period. The choice of game doesn't have a too big impact on this, as I've grown so strong as a gamer that I've probably had under a half dozen sessions &lt;5 since 2005 - well under 5% of the time, certainly.

People's life satisfaction tends to improve as they get older.<br/><br/>For me, the "Expecting an 8, getting a 6" thing isn't about expecting that future play will be better than presnt, it's about expecting that the next session will be at the top of the normal variation from session to session. I expect that because I try to fix the problems with the last session in the next one.<br/><br/>I think an interesting thing would be to look at the variance in self-reported session enjoyment over time. It would also be interesting to look at the difference in self-reported enjoyment between different players in the same game.

Occasionally it's because of a failure of the rules but never, as I can recall, from differing creative agendas (unless you count being an arse as a CA).
