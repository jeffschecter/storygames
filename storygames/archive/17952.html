I've been having trouble with it, so I thought I'd think out loud some.  The original character list is here:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/spiritofthecentury/shadowslarp/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.darkshire.net/jhkim/rpg/spiritofthecentury/shadowslarp/</a><br/><br/>My approach to this has been to take pulps villains as they are written, and add in some real-world history into their backgrounds.  The primary situation is that the uber-villain is essentially holding try-outs for what group will be his next partner - with three contenders being Fu Manchu and his allies, Gorilla Khan and his allies in Africa, or the secret Incan Empire in Peru.  I've run this twice previously, and I noted that some characters are picked last:  Yen How the pan-Asian political, Zanaka the Bantu Warlord, and Agent Maita the Incan secret agent.  <br/><br/>The first isn't a very strong archetype to modern players.  Yen How is from the novel "The Yellow Danger" and is a twist on Sun Yat Sen.  In the book, Yen How united China and Japan to threaten the West, so his power is political which is tricky in a larp - and in personality archetype he is too close to Sun Yat Sen.  <br/><br/>As a replacement, I decided to pick Lai Choi San, the Dragon Lady.  She is from the 1930s comic "Terry and the Pirates" inspired by a supposedly-historical female Chinese pirate - and is the origin of the term "Dragon Lady".  This is definitely a strong archetype.  I've tried to make more characters gender neutral (so the Incans have a "ruler" rather than a king or queen), but there's no getting around this in some cases.  <br/><br/>There is some secret background with the Incans related to their concern for the threat of being exposed by Dr. Henry Jones Jr.  So I want to keep Agent Maita, but I decided to bind him more to an archetype by giving him the tagline, "Man of a Thousand Faces".  This was the tagline for a pulp hero, Agent X, so I'm mixing my sources here - but the Incans are a mixed source already.  They're loosely based on Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull, but in that one the Indians were all wordless savages. Similar sources include Tintin's "Prisoners of the Sun" and similar plots about secret Incan gold and flying saucers.  The archetypes are a little weak, though.  <br/><br/>The more difficult has been the Africans.  I feel like people accept playing an Asian villain from a racist source like Fu Manchu, but it is more uncomfortable to play a black villain.  My other non-gorilla African character is not from the pulps at all, but rather a semi-historical figure, Andr\xe9 Matsoua.  I'm actually OK with there being a little discomfort - but I'd prefer it to be relatively equal among the character choices so that some players don't feel put upon.  I had been thinking of making a character as La, Emissary of the Lost City of Opar.  The city of Opar is from the second Tarzan book - inhabited by the degraded descendants of Atlantis.  However, the secret lost city in Africa overlaps a lot in archetypes with the secret Incan Empire in Peru.  <br/><br/>Ideally, I want a distinctly African villain archetype that is still fun to play - but I'm having trouble with it.  <br/><br/>To connect this with bigger ideas, I think that archetypes are often very important for play - and in particular are probably a key behind the explosion of Apocalypse World variants.                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405938/#Comment_405938" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T11:39:38+00:00" title="February 11, 2013 11:39AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2013 11:41AM by Rickard.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was sketching on the expansion of <b>This Is Pulp</b>, and because the first (not published) edition only had American white people as archetypes, the edition should be about people from other continents (and one robot). So I started to write down a couple of archetypes where one was tribal warrior. I looked at it and I realised what I was doing. I wanted archetypes, not stereotypes. In my first edition, I randomized the gender of the archetypes, and I ended up with a young woman as a mad scientist, just because I wanted to break the stereotype.<br/><br/>What you want with an archetype is something that people can (even vaguely) recognise, but I think it's equally important that you also make something new of it, so it wont turn into a stereotype. Stereotypes are good as a quick starter, but they get tiresome in the long end.<br/><br/>But to answer your question, I think Tahitian voodoo magic is really cool, but voodoo is actually from Christianity. One thing that is really African is zombie creation.

I don't think it has anything to do with Tahiti, though \u2014\xa0Polynesian religions are entirely different.<br/><br/>Back to the original issue: Distinguishing between archetypes and stereotypes is difficult when there are so many strong negative stereotypes around already. The best solution I can think of is to try to make your character be the opposite of the stereotypes: if he's African, make him cultured and superhuman, not primitive and subhuman. If he has to be a villain, make his villainy aloof, not savage. <br/><br/>One idea that comes to mind is an inverse Josef Mengele \u2014 a brilliant doctor obsessed with African racial superiority who performs evil medical experiments on human subjects to try to find a way to wipe out the Caucasian race.<br/><br/>Or maybe he's obsessed with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mali_Empire" rel="nofollow">Malian Empire</a> and wants to restore its capital Timbuktu and take over the world from there.

I wanted lost gold and flying saucers, which are common pulp themes.  The funny thing is that the 1946 comic has natives that are more human and two-dimensional than the 2008 film, where natives are more like monsters that come out of the walls.  <br/><br/>The East Asian characters are all drawn straight from period sources: Fu Manchu and Fah lo Suee from Sax Rohmer, Shiwan Khan from The Shadow stories, and the Dragon Lady from Terry and the Pirates.  <br/><br/>I think you're right that there simply are no vintage pulp African characters that would be palatable, but I would want to at least approximate.  A zombie master seems possible.  While zombies are mainly Haitian, there are at least some are set in Africa.  I'm reading "The Forbidden Trail" by Jane Rice (1941) now - which is set in Liberia.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405951">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405951/#Comment_405951" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T14:04:46+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  2:04PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Egyptian mummies are from Africa.

Two of them are gorillas enhanced by weird science, and one is a legendary messianic leader of Gabon.  <br/><br/>Really I'm looking for iconic opponents to Tarzan, but I don't think there are any recognizable ones.  The closest I've read in the books or adaptations is the Russian ne'er-do-well Rokoff, but that's a stretch and not very fun in the pulp sense.  <br/><br/>Actually, the zombie-making itself isn't that vital to the situation of this particular larp (since no one has troops or backup).  However, the <b>witch doctor</b> is definitely a recognizable archetype who could have a background including zombies.  Now the trick is how to make a witch doctor palatable enough to be fun to play, but still true to the pulps.  Plus it's distinct enough from the others - whereas my lost city Atlantean was much like the Incans.  <br/><br/>In the original E.R. Burroughs Tarzan stories, Africans are always superstitious and foolish - they would never have real magic power.  However, there were many Tarzan adaptations that strayed from this to take up other pulp archetypes.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zedlopez" title="zedlopez"><img alt="zedlopez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zedlopez">zedlopez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405956/#Comment_405956" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T15:18:12+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  3:18PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One could make a case for Nyarlathotep as a pulp African villain -- the eponymous story was first published in 1920 (albeit in the United Amateur, not in a pulp magazine) and that story describes him a 2700-year-old Egyptian (or at least of presenting an appearance consistent with such, and describing himself as something like that, though it's completely unclear what the truth was.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_405960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405960/#Comment_405960" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T16:18:39+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  4:18PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 11, 2013 4:18PM by Graham.">edited February 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stop me if I'm way off, John.

I'm not certain of that, though, and I personally have no problem with the character.  Alternately, maybe it is more that being a warlord is overshadowed by his ally, Gorilla Khan the Conqueror Ape.  Too much overlap of being violent, and everyone loves gorillas.  I did think that Zanaka's talent abilities weren't as cool as some of the other characters, but those aren't public knowledge and so wouldn't affect selection.  <br/><br/>I think the witch doctor idea is more iconic and cooler than the warlord, though.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_405980">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/405980/#Comment_405980" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-11T19:07:33+00:00" title="February 11, 2013  7:07PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and Storn -  thanks a lot for the pic and idea, but the high-tech theme clashes with the authentic pulp feel that I'm trying for.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_406030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/406030/#Comment_406030" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-12T09:51:20+00:00" title="February 12, 2013  9:51AM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, my same reasoning applies - if you think a player might not be okay with it, there is probably a reason for that too, and maybe you shouldn't do it.
