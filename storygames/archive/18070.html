Unstore is just a website that collects sales information and payment links for individual publishers. IPR, in comparison, is a warehousing, fulfillment, distribution, web retail and convention retail supermarket of services. Unstore doesn't cost anything (except some server costs for Vincent, but he doesn't collect those from the users as far as I know), while IPR is financed by taking a slice out of all the sales that go through it.<br/><br/>I don't use Unstore myself, mainly because I don't have the fulfillment capacity to mail directly to the USA, where most of the customer base for Unstore presumably is - I could just sell to Europe through it, but haven't gotten around to setting it up with Vincent (who I presumptously assume would take me if I asked). IPR has served my American sales and fulfillment needs well, and the new management has proved both professional and friendly, willing to seek ways to make things work for everybody concerned. The IPR deal might or might not make sense for individual publishers, I'm sure that there are plenty of those for whom the type of contract IPR operates under is not optimal. On the other hand, I am pretty apathetic about the IPR connection, so I could imagine switching to e.g. Unstore with suitable indie fulfillment at some point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407936">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407936/#Comment_407936" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T03:59:43+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  3:59AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, thanks.

IPR used to be more ideologically motivated, perhaps, but nowadays it's perhaps more exact to characterize it as a small webstore that just happens to have had a Forge-related indie background a few years back. This background shows in the demographic profile of the client and customer bases, but it's not an indication of active and on-going ideological commitment to indieness or hippie design or whatever. IPR is a tad more flexible and innovative in its marketing moves than your average webstore (they represent publishers at conventions, for example), though, so one might say that the influence of desperate indie operation is still felt in the practices.<br/><br/>For customer viewpoint a single-destination "official indie store" that hosts "all indie games" (an impossible goal, but a possible ambition) and nothing but indie would be pretty useful. In that regard the Unstore is on a pretty promising road in some ways - there's no reason why everybody who is eligible wouldn't want to be listed there. It's just a matter of time (and us latecomers developing some independent fulfillment measures) and patience, and perhaps some slow site development, for the Unstore to become truly representative of the state of the indie rpg market.<br/><br/>(I'm obviously interested in this topic, as I've been developing my own indie rpg store over the last decade. There's definitely a lot of bibliographical and cultural value in having retail resources that focus on this field.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407940/#Comment_407940" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T05:26:23+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  5:26AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since I don't sell anything I create (yet), I don't have a strong opinion either way.

Most of the utility in conventioneering comes from active marketing and visibility, and you can't count on either of those as an indie publisher unless you do them yourself. IPR, for instance, will have a nice booth at a convention, but they're not in position to put your book up front and tell everybody to buy it - they're representing 200 different products and not just yours. Obviously they'll do their best to know what your game is about, and they'll tell people if they ask, but for the vast majority of product in a large line-up like IPR the only convention visibility they get is being present on a shelf full of other games. And that's just a minor, minor sliver in the range of things you go to conventions for as a small publisher.<br/><br/>Of course this is all just extra bonus for people like say myself who just aren't going to e.g. Gencon anyway (crossing the Atlantic for it is something of a threshold). My point, though, is that you can't think of convention representation by a retailer - even a well-meaning one - to somehow replace your own presence. IPR doesn't go to conventions "so you don't have to", but if you've decided not to go, then the small boost you'll get from IPR is a nice extra.<br/><br/>Thinking about it, that same principle goes for many of the other things IPR does: if you can't be bothered to conventioneer, do direct sales, fulfill your orders and so on, IPR does them all. The expense of IPR client membership is the same (proportional to sales) whether you'd rather do some of these things yourself, so it is at its most profitable for those who are happy to make use of the entire range of services. To illustrate, it wouldn't make sense to have IPR do your con sales if your main marketing strategy was going to conventions to promote your game yourself: you'd be better off selling direct while you're there yourself, pocketing the IPR fee as well. Likewise, if you're capable and willing to set up your own direct web sales, then you just lost one of the three main reasons to use IPR web sales (storefront, fulfillment and customer visibility, in case you're wondering).<br/><br/>The Unstore is interesting for the real do-it-all-yourself indie personality exactly because it sort of attempts to solve the customer visibility problem without also hassling the designer-publisher with all the other services that they might or might not want. I've no idea how the Unstore brand matches up with the IPR, though - I'd be surprised if IPR didn't experience bigger total customer flow between the two, but that's basically just a guess on my part. Time will tell, of course, and the quality of the crowd is ultimately what matters: if IPR grows its customer base from people with mainstream tastes, while the Unstore remains fundamentally Forgean, then the value of the latter audience will continue to grow for designers who want to reach that specific audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408020/#Comment_408020" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T12:45:48+00:00" title="March  4, 2013 12:45PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 4, 2013 12:47PM by catty_big.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>if you can't be bothered to conventioneer</blockquote>\nIt's not a question of being bothered- I go to a ton of cons here in the UK, in fact just this weekend I was at a con in Leicester, in the Midlands, where btw I also saw Chris Braganza of 6d6, Simon Burley, the writer of Squadron UK, and Alessio Cavatore, who I presume needs no introduction.

Everyone does their own sales, their own mailing, their own printing, etc. It's like an ETSY just for artisanal RPGs.<br/><br/>IPR is an actual distributor/fulfillment house as well as an online retailer. Everyone else has done a pretty good job of describing their business model, and I think they do a pretty good job of it considering the scope of the very small companies they're doing business with. My store reps them at several East Coast cons and we're grateful they exist because it means I have a source for a lot of games I couldn't otherwise get.<br/><br/>The cost/benefit analysis of attending Cons is an entire other thread of its own! A lot of it depends on how you think your time is best spent. Some creators really like to hand-sell their stuff! Others would rather spend their precious con time actually running their game(s) and attending/hosting seminars. I've seen some creators who are retail naturals. Most aren't (any more than most retailers are natural game designers), and are better served by letting people who sell all day IRL do their selling for them and getting out at the game tables and seminars to do what they're really good at, which is think and talk about game design and execution.<br/><br/>In the current moment where discussion of 'selling your game' often seems to start and end with Kickstarter, it's great to see creators keeping their eye on the long tail, thanks.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408032">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408032/#Comment_408032" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-04T14:34:11+00:00" title="March  4, 2013  2:34PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like the descriptions of IPR above.

A lot of it depends on how you think your time is best spent. Some creators really like to hand-sell their stuff! Others would rather spend their precious con time actually running their game(s) and attending/hosting seminars. I've seen some creators who are retail naturals.</blockquote>\nWell, tbh I like doing <i>all </i>of that. I guess at a con though, running games would be the best use of my time, because folks are usually more inclined to buy a game if they\u2019ve seen it demoed, especially by the author. So in a way demoing games <i>is</i> selling them.\n<blockquote>In the current moment where discussion of 'selling your game' often seems to start and end with Kickstarter, it's great to see creators keeping their eye on the long tail, thanks.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nYeah, I\u2019m already seeing a backlash against Kickstarter. But if it wasn\u2019t for KS a lot of great games would never have made it to the tables.\n<blockquote>Don't dismiss DriveThruRPG!

In fact DriveThru was the first place I thought of when I started to consider how and where to sell my games. <br/><br/>One further point about the unStore, and other third party sites: if you\u2019re doing all the fulfillment yourself, you\u2019re opening yourself up to all those complaints from customers that you didn\u2019t hire a time machine to deliver their product yesterday.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_408112">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408112/#Comment_408112" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T06:29:49+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  6:29AM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2013 10:16AM by catty_big.">edited March 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">@Eero_Tuovinen</a> <br/>Just looked at my last post but one, and it looks like I was a bit harsh. It's probably a language thing, but "can't be bothered" is quite a loaded expresssion, which suggests the person is being lazy.

Gencon isn't part of my own publishing strategy either at this time, so it'd be pretty ridiculous of me to accuse anybody of laziness because they didn't want to go to Gencon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
