I think my goal here is to use the "player" term when it's important to distinguish between the characters and the people playing the game, and otherwise not to do so. I'm open to being persuaded otherwise.</blockquote>\nThe thorniness, of course, arises out of the desire to simultaneously a) not occlude the difference between players and characters and b) not write shittily and come off like a pretentious, precious asshole.<br/><br/>Where do you come out on this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_211908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211908/#Comment_211908" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T08:07:39+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  8:07AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the thing to be most clear about is what is being done, not who is doing it. Everything else will work itself out. If you say "the character loses 10 hit points" or "the player loses 10 hit points" it is probably not a big deal, we all know what it means.  If you say "the character says hello" or "the player says hello", then it is a big deal, because both of those are feasible, and some means of clarification even beyond the noun phrase is needed. <br/><br/>I would address it like this. Of course, this prevents things like mass search-and-replace, so, easy for ME to say.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211909/#Comment_211909" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-12T08:10:26+00:00" title="June 12, 2009  8:10AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My habit has for years been to write exactly: I use "character" when I mean the character and "player" when I mean the player.

So it's not all cut and dried.
