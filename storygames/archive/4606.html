Or used to, before Life forced me to ration my time better. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> So now I play them a couple of hours a week. In any case, I think there are a lot of things we can yet learn from video games for our less electronic hobby. You might have noticed some of that in my game design.<br/><br/>One thing I'd like to talk about: casual explorative gaming. I know many people who like to play this way at times. I think it's just as much a valid and coherent play style as challenge-based or thematic gaming.<br/><br/>I believe Lego Star Wars is a perfect analogy to a game that caters to casual explorative gamers, and I'm not sure if we have an actual roleplaying game that serves this style. We have techniques, though (like fudging dice).<br/><br/>So here are the important parts about that video game:<br/><br/>- There is virtually no penalty for death; you reappear instantly and pick up the few coins you dropped<br/>- The game revolves around finding sources for your coins, which allow you to buy things that are secondary to the game<br/>- Puzzles and platform challenges are very easy<br/>- There are dozens over dozens of characters to unlock, which are mostly different in Color<br/>- But the overall Color matters, because it gives substance to the experience<br/>- And you get to play asskickers like Obi Wan and Darth Vader<br/><br/>You hop into the game, shoot some things, don't worry about getting killed, and never lose any progress you've made. In the meantime, you find secrets, explore the levels, enjoy different characters, and so on. Multiplayer is more fun, naturally.<br/><br/>I've roleplayed like this at times. It's great fun, and it's all about exploring the world, finding out things, not worrying about losing your character and getting kicked out of the game, savoring the setting and coolness of our characters without having to prove ourselves, and so on. But when my friends and I played this way, we had to rely on "cheating", basically: we'd fudge so our characters wouldn't die, we'd ignore tedious rules that would have taken hours to resolve something, and so on.<br/><br/>Is there a game out there specifically designed for this style of play? What are your techniques for and experiences with this?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104235/#Comment_104235" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T20:36:32+00:00" title="October 22, 2007  8:36PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Christian, <a href="http://kallistipress.com/?q=node/3" rel="nofollow">Conquer the Horizon</a> can scratch that itch.<br/><br/>You can't die, the reward cycle is all about creation and reincorporation of setting details, and can be played short, long, or in between.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104245">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric" title="Eric"><img alt="Eric" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric">Eric</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104245/#Comment_104245" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T22:28:33+00:00" title="October 22, 2007 10:28PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 22, 2007 10:30PM by Eric.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While we're at it, somebody find me a game that plays like God of War.

You lay down cards that represent unimproved caverns. You draw monsters and let them loose in the caverns. Some monsters change or improve the caverns (i.e. dwarves). Some monsters run around eating stuff. Some monster can make alliances. The gelatinous cube scoops up treasure and accumulates it. Every once in a while you draw an adventuring party and it charges through the dungeon clearing out areas and redistributing treasure until it gets killed.<br/><br/>It was kind of fun, but very rough around the edges.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104252/#Comment_104252" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-22T23:33:39+00:00" title="October 22, 2007 11:33PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Does it matter that you're playing through chapters of a very familiar story that has already been written?<br/><br/>I bet it does.

Somebody needs to make a Lego game out of the movie versions of the Lord of the Rings.<br/><br/>Of course, that doesn't mean that it won't work in an RPG.  What the game really needs to do to create this kind of play is create situation and color very quickly so that you can jump right into play.  Maybe with something like Agon's island generation tables, only focused on a shorter timespan.  The other thing is that the mechanics would need to be engaging and fun to play with, along the lines of a quick board or card game.<br/><br/>The Emperor's Heart does a lot of this.  So does Basic D&amp;D.  Those would be the places I'd start looking if I were you, Christian.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104303">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1" title="forlorn1"><img alt="forlorn1" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/197/n6SIEC3F01EX7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/forlorn1">forlorn1</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104303/#Comment_104303" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T07:56:46+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  7:56AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            and <b>Lego Indiana Jones</b> is coming next year....  yippee more Lego awesomeness...<br/><br/>I got nothing on an RPG counterpart though...<br/><br/>Jeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104317/#Comment_104317" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T08:44:43+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  8:44AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I just want to go on a tangent from the thread <i>title</i> (ahem) and indicate that Lego dudes make great cheap miniatures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_104323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104323/#Comment_104323" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-23T09:08:14+00:00" title="October 23, 2007  9:08AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The one I am looking forward to most is the <b>Lego Batman</b> game.<br/><br/>More on-topic, I think that you really can't underestimate how important two things are here: one, the massive internal library of color players have, so you get that "hey!

There's a reason that every console RPG under the sun has you deliver a package across town and kill rats in the basement of the tavern. Nobody thinks anyone cares about packages or rats, they're introductions to combat and the world. You learn what the town is like by shuttling back and forth across it and looking at what you see.<br/><br/>Similarly, if you start in the Forgotten Realms in, say Waterdeep, and start in a particular neighborhood in Waterdeep, and have a few adventures in that neighborhood before you 'let the players out', they will learn that neighborhood well. A few of those and they've learned Waterdeep well. A few of those and they've learned the coast well.

Games that allow for rapid creation of characters with decent depth could also acheive this, I think.<br/><br/>A big setting gives you something to explore. One problem with big setting is that it's often presented as a body of knowledge the characters are somehow expected to already know. If the setting was designed to plausibly present itself to characters peice by piece I think that would support exploratory play better.

I suspect that there's a way to complicate the two traditional options of 1) GM makes stuff up as you encounter it, and 2) GM looks stuff up in book as you enter a new area.  If you distribute the GM's authority a bit, then you can have the players collective make stuff up as you encounter it, but, ideally, you'd want ways to make that stuff consistent despite a whole lot of cooks.  That's led me to think that the second option (looking stuff up in books, encounter style) has some potential, especially if you view "encounters" more like <i>Shadow of Yesterday</i> Keys or <i>Weapons of the Gods</i> Loresheets (bit of setting and character that you can interact with in multiple different ways, opening up new options for play), especially if those encounters develop as players interact with them.  I'm currently <a href="http://thouandone.wordpress.com/2007/10/23/more-transantiago/" rel="nofollow">experimenting with this kind of thing</a> in my contest game, <i>Transantiago</i>.  I'm pretty hopeful cool things will come of it, ideally stuff that I can implement more fully in <a href="http://firmamentproject.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">Fingers on the Firmament</a>.  So, yeah.  This is something I've been thinking a bunch about, recently, since I love exploratory games but dislike the burden they put on the GM (which I don't really find that fun anymore).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_104575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/104575/#Comment_104575" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-24T08:40:40+00:00" title="October 24, 2007  8:40AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>You know, I keep hearing that, but apparently I've missed where they're any cheaper than metal rpg minis or e-baying for prepainted collectible minis.</blockquote>\nYou are forgetting the versatility of Lego dudes.<br/><br/>About two years ago, I started running the Savage Worlds 50 Fathoms campaign, a fantasy pirate setting.  Savage Worlds doesn't require minis, but I thought it might be fun to play it with them.  Not really being a minis gamer and owning about none that would be useful as pirates, I bought a bunch of Lego Pirates from Ebay.  To be fair, they probably cost about the same as the CMG figs, but at the time I wasn't aware of that many pirate themed CMGs (except the one with the ships, which wasn't what I was looking for).<br/><br/>The game ran for a year and then I started running Deadlands.  Suddenly I needed cowboy minis instead of Pirates.  So I bought a bag of cowboy hats and a bag of revolvers from ebay for a total of about \xc2\xa34 and suddenly I had as many cowboys as I could use.  When I wanted to play a fantasy game, I just bought a selection of knight swords and whatnot.<br/><br/>Once you've got the bulk of figures, the rest is reasonably cheap bacause a generic looking bloke with a sword and knight's helm looks the part of the fighter.  Change that to a Cowboy hat and a 6 shooter and he's an outlaw.  Give him a musket and a cutlass and he's a pirate etc etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
