I have found, in retrospect, that the best games are ones where I have railroaded the first session heavily. I create a cast of NPC\u2019s and their motivations, and a few \u201cWorld\u201d type problems. I make the players meet all the respected parties and problems, in a relatively elaborate conflict (to get a feel for all of the games mechanics). All the other times it usually becomes a struggle to get the game off the ground. <br/>When do all of you railroad?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div>

little time as a group working up setting/background/situation, how much the game invests in centralized authority, how familiar the players are with the rules, if your players groove on creating setting and situation, and a host of other factors.  <br/><br/>See Fiasco, PTA, Microscope, et. al. for ways that this can work well.  These all depend on "a clear starting vision" in their own way but in a different way than Bob meant.  <br/><br/>But if the players are unknown quantities, then a GM-imposed vision can work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
