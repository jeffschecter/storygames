It was also not only my first game of IaWA, but my first time playing (successfully) over Skype.<br/><br/>Much thanks to John for running the game and to Filip for his tremendous efforts in explaining the game to everyone!<br/><br/>My favourite moments were definitely the bits with the Artificial Intelligence trapped in the human body of the comatose girlfriend, especially these two: <br/><br/>--The scene at the hospital where she unplugs an elderly patient from life support and watches them die. When the hacker tells her, "you know, sometimes people can die, even in The Game..." she replies, "Well, that's the user's fault, isn't it? They had to remove the safety protocols. Besides, there are always more humans around."<br/><br/>--The two of them eventually making love just outside their crashed car, just off the side of the highway, and being interrupted by an emergency patrol: "Are you two alright?" "Uh, yeah, never been better, thanks! You might want to check on the car, though."<br/><br/>A couple of interesting observations and a question:<br/><br/>--I enjoyed the "non-action" scenes, especially at the beginning. If there were fewer players sitting around waiting, I would have enjoyed getting deeper into those conversations. <br/>--In general, it was interesting to see how the very intense, dramatic scenes we had really didn't have the punch they could have, because we didn't really get a chance to build up to them.<br/><br/>I know that goes against some traditional "Forge" advice, but there you have it. I feel that a game like IaWA, which allows you to get to the hard and fast action very very quickly wouldn't suffer from a little bit of slower pacing to build up tension and develop characters more.<br/><br/>My question is a rules question:<br/><br/>--If after the first round, two opponents negotiate instead of going on to the second round, does the one with smaller dice go onto the We Owe List?<br/><br/>Filip said "no", which makes sense, but the rules summaries I've seen online seem to suggest "yes". Is there a definite answer on this?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169087">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169087/#Comment_169087" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T10:04:05+00:00" title="September 15, 2008 10:04AM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I'm pretty sure the answer to your last question is yes.  Not being eliminated (doubled out) in the first round is the only deciding factor to going on the We Owe list.  If you engage someone who has better dice, you're eligible.  If you survive the first round, you're on.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs an aside...I don't know what you mean by going against traditional Forge advice...aside from the opinions at the Forge being too diverse to have such a thing to begin with, I don't recall anyone advocating racing pell mell into conflict with no build up.  In fact, there has been much advice given to the contrary...that yes, taking the time to build up is a good thing.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there is alot of play going on where that isn't happening.  But I think that's largely an artifact of 1) becoming enamored of how much fun getting to actual conflict is (as opposed to meandering aimlessly without ever getting there) and people rushing forward to get more of it (falling into the "too much of a good thing" trap).  And 2) alot of people learning these new games in a convention environment where story cycles are by necessity compressed...and then not realizing that actual play at home doesn't have to be so accelerated.  But its definitely not the result of any Forge Advice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson" title="Simon_Pettersson"><img alt="Simon_Pettersson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Pettersson">Simon_Pettersson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169148/#Comment_169148" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T12:37:59+00:00" title="September 15, 2008 12:37PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, it seems it was a good thing I dropped out. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>Anyway, it was expected things would get better after everyone had a chance to get acquainted with the system.

We got you some English practice.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I would dig continuing this cyberpunk thing, finding out what happens to poor Jeff, or maybe trying some other oracle with you guys.<br><br>I'm geeked to hear that people dug Rhiannon, the murderous secret-sadist system administrator AI.  I enjoyed playing her, esp. when Hiroshi (Filip) was tricking her (and, I think, waiting for me to order a reach for the dice) and I was just rolling with it in anticipation of the fun we were going to have once she was fleshbound...<br/><br/>Regarding buildup:<br/><br/>Initially, the conflict that dominated was the Jeff (Paul) / Mayor (Jason) thing.  The Mayor was a Game addict who wanted to carry out real-life hits on his in-game rivals.  Jeff was an accountant-turned-brainwashed cybernetic assassin, made-to-order for the mayor by Dr. Fausto.  Once Fausto gave Jeff the 411 on his situation, Jeff started moving his killing-machine ass straight towards the Mayor with a murderous gleam in his eye.  Which is reasonable and believable, y'know, because the Mayor's done some bad stuff to him.  But I had trouble with this for a few reasons:<br/><br/>1) All four PCs were in that scene and the Skype play got a bit chaotic.  It's really tough to kibbutz on stuff in Skype.  It might be a good idea, in a large scene like that, to treat it a bit more like a classroom and ask that people wait on the GM (or someone) call on them to speak.  Happily, smaller scenes worked much better.<br/><br/>2) The fiction felt broken.  Jeff looks like a street bum and he confronted the Mayor at an A-list fundraiser.  I left this alone because I didn't really have an NPC who could influence that situation.  In retrospect, I should have framed this scene with much more emphasis on how Jeff stood out.  Or I should have framed away from the fundraiser and to some more believable setting (but perhaps a less interesting one -- I was attracted to the fundraiser as a setting initially.)   Filip even prompted me to frame the scene.  I didn't run with it.<br/><br/>3) The scene contained some microconflicts that slowed things down.  Everyone agreed that Jeff should confront the mayor, but there was some disagreement on how it should go down, and we diced that out some.<br/><br/>4) The confrontation felt like it should have been 'circled' (IAWA page 11) and I couldn't figure out how to do that.  There didn't appear to be any restraints on Jeff.  He was laser-focused on the Mayor.  The thing was, he confronted the Mayor on the Mayor's home turf, and I should have exploited that somehow to put him at a really clear disadvantage. <br/><br/>(what were Jeff's best interests?  I don't have the GT file here...)<br/><br/>5) The confrontation didn't escalate things, but neither did it decide them -- not until Simon conceded that Dr. Fausto's hands had been cut off, and mostly, I think this came out because Simon had to leave and get to bed.  <br/><br/>In my experience, IAWA games have two broad phases.  In the first phase, play meanders a bit as  everyone tries conflicts on for size.  Then something happens that will galvanize the game, get it all moving in the same direction.  In the second phase, everyone chooses up sides for a big confrontation.  We got to the big confrontation before we'd gotten into a groove, so that confrontation wasn't as engaging as it might have been.  I think people might not have wanted to narrate Big Consequences before we were really engaged in the fiction.  <br/><br/>It seems like the lesson here is that if a scene feels broken, get decisive about it, or transform it.  Change the setting, advance forward in time, remove a character from it, etc.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169176">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169176/#Comment_169176" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T13:49:16+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  1:49PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>I think you're right on with your comments. I can imagine that, for you, "fixing" the fundraiser situation was difficult, since at least three PCs were not only involved and active (at the "table") but also in charge of the situation within the fiction itself. You didn't have an easy way of changing or reframing things without really breaking the flow, so to speak.<br/><br/>In some way, though, that conflict allowed us to get more "in the groove" for the rest of the session, though. It's kind of like doing some white water rafting: you feel nervous and unsure until the first wave hits and you're soaked through. Once you're wet, you can throw yourself fully into the experience, and enjoying subsequent "waves" more.<br/><br/><br/>Ralph,<br/><br/>The whole "conflict NOW vs. conflict LATER" thing is a tricky one to talk about because it's gone through many phases. For someone new to the Forge or the Forge approach to gaming (that whole Story Now business), especially with older systems, the advice was "get to conflicts, as quickly as possible". That's the advice I'm referring to, usually given to prevent people from floundering around and not having anything happen. I'm talking about people with, say, decades of D&amp;D experience and little idea of how to get an interesting situation developed, perhaps even major problems figuring out what "conflict" is at all. They need or needed to hear that because, absent a gun and a hexmap, many of them didn't know how to create conflict at all.<br/><br/>For those who are playing now, and getting into games with potentially explosive Situation, like IaWA, the advice given is rightly the opposite: as the game is waving major conflict right in front of your face, the players need rather to remember to back off and "circle" the explosive points.<br/><br/>Does that make sense? I'm not intimately familiar with the Forge, so I'm not trying to misrepresent anyone--it's just an isolated point of view.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169183">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169183/#Comment_169183" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T13:51:53+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  1:51PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            John,<br/><br/>Jeff Stomowitz's Best Interests were something like:<br/><br/>--Stop the Mayor from killing anyone else.<br/>--Make Fausto reverse his work on him and give up his illegal surgery business altogether.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169195">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169195/#Comment_169195" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T14:17:47+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  2:17PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, yeah, you've hit on one of the problems that has plagued the Forge (and I suspect human interaction in general) for years...people taking specific advice given in a specific context for a specific application...and then extrapolating it hither and yon into situations where it wasn't meant to be applied.

They both arose directly from your character concept, and it seemed like you were able to pursue them simultaneously for the most part.<br/><br/>I think that BIs are like handles that the other players in the game can use to toss a character around. I think a character with highly convergent BIs is tough for the rest of the table to influence, because that character will be strongly drawn in a single direction.<br/><br/>Good point! I actually wondered about this while we drafting our Best Interests--as our banter was linking Fausto and the Mayor closer and closer together, those Best Interests were converging, and when the game was on, they converged even more--especially because the surgeon didn't get a chance to go after the mayor (due to the player leaving at that particular moment), which would have mixed things up nicely.<br/><br/>The two of them ending up acting much more like allies than they otherwise might have, which made my character's Best Interests line up completely.\n<blockquote><br/>And I hope I don't sound all negative about your play style and stuff; this is just me trying to figure out IAWA's best practices. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></blockquote>\nNot at all!

I think in that later shopping mall conversation she referred to the possibility of death in real life as a "designer's error".

That was beautiful.\n<blockquote>One thing that was a problem for me - and it's apparent to me only now - is that none of you had a Skype avatar. I had some troubles with distinguishing voices after the fourth person joined, and I've just realised that I tend to attach the voices to the pictures in my head. It seems intriguing to me, actually.</blockquote>\nInteresting! I too, had trouble telling Simon and Jason apart, for some reason. Filip, you were the best in this sense, as your accent identified you immediately. More people should have fun accents! (And not only for the great cause of Skype gaming.) <br/><br/>From your perspective, however, you had the toughest job--the other four players all basically sound American.\n<blockquote>Also, looking at the storymap now, I find it interesting how the Mayor has the most lines leading to the points of conflict. With that setup, Jason was somewhat disadvantaged, indeed. My character, on the other hand, had conflict links to only one other player character - which might be one of the reasons of the later split. Possibly, a mistake during the Best Interests stage on my part.</blockquote>\nAlso, we didn't get to dig into Rhiannon's desires to steal Fausto's techniques, which could have helped tie all that back together. Of course, with Fausto's player (Simon) gone, John understandably did not make that move on Rhiannon's behalf.\n<blockquote><blockquote>Paul, I'm pretty sure the answer to your last question is yes. Not being eliminated (doubled out) in the first round is the only deciding factor to going on the We Owe list. If you engage someone who has better dice, you're eligible. If you survive the first round, you're on.</blockquote>\nHmm, I've been sure you actually need to move to the second round of the action sequence. However, I couldn't find any clarification for that on the Forge today.<br/><br/>The book doesn't seem to be perfectly clear about this. I think my interpretation resulted from that "If you're still in the fight" sentence in the Owe List section. But now I can see how it could be read the other way as well.<br/><br/>Dunno. With the option of getting on the Owe List even when the action sequence ends with negotiation in the first round, it seems just to easy for what it does.</blockquote>\nCan anyone resolve this? The point Filip brings up is a good one, I think. Getting through one round and negotiating your way out does feel... somewhat too easy.<br/><br/>I have another question from this game, as well, for all the IaWA folks:<br/><br/>--At the end of an action sequence, who does the narrating? <br/><br/>I've seen "Answerer narrates, always", "winner describes what form the consequences take", and "everyone narrates".<br/><br/>One discussion I read said that "the Challenger's challenge happens, period" (Execution). I saw another that said, "the Answerer then can describe _how_ it happens" (Effect). Finally, the quote from above suggests that the winner narrates the form the consequences take (esp. injury or exhaustion -- also Effect).<br/><br/>Help?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169260/#Comment_169260" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T17:43:03+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  5:43PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2008 5:43PM by John_Harper.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite><br/>So, while the system doesn't necessarily resolve conflicts, In a Wicked Age... definitely needs to have some conflicts (as does any other story)!</blockquote>\nYes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_169262">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169262/#Comment_169262" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T17:46:01+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  5:46PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2008 5:53PM by John_Harper.">edited September 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The answerer says how the initial action was successful, blocked, or reversed, and why someone carries an advantage forward.<br/><br/>Then (and separately), if you choose exhaustion or injury, the winner says how you're exhausted or injured.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_169299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/169299/#Comment_169299" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-09-15T20:21:26+00:00" title="September 15, 2008  8:21PM">September 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            ...even if you've been doubled?
