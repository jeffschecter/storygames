We were talking (albeit briefly) about the game <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recon_(role-playing_game)" rel="nofollow">Recon</a> when he referred to it as a story game.  And that gave me pause.  I said, "That's a story game?"<br/><br/>From what I gather this is not new to those who know Jason, but I'm a relative newcomer so it was news to me.  If this has been covered before elsewhere, then feel free to just ignore the whole discussion.<br/><br/>Anyway.  I was proceeding from the assumption that a "story game" was one that modeled story over physics.  Drawing from the example of the above-mentioned thread: <i>carry: a game about war</i> would be a story game, while <i>Recon</i> would not.  To put it another way, I would consider a game that's more concerned about where the bullets go and how much damage they do to be outside the realm of a story game, while one that's <i>mechanically interested</i> in why the bullets are flying in the first place would fit comfortably within my definition.<br/><br/>But am I totally wrong?  I mean, it's possible to tell a story with <i>Recon</i>.  I know this because I've done it.  And I've done it with <i>Merc</i> and <i>Twilight 2000</i>, too.  I just don't get the sense that <i>story</i> is their first concern.  Certainly there's nothing in the rules that directly address matters of story or even roleplaying, as far as that goes.  Those parts of the game are player-provided and basically taken as read.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252775">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252775/#Comment_252775" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T06:14:03+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  6:14AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We've had long discussions about the "story game" definition; some use it as a narrow subset of RPGs that focuses on stories, while others use it as a superset of RPGs that includes all games with substantive narrative components (i.e., tabletop RPGs, jeepform, LARPs, etc.).

In Recon-as-written, for example, players have significant agency insofar as they affect the story through the instrument of their characters.  And plenty of non-"traditional" (is there a worse piece of jargon in gaming?

In most games I've ran or played in over the years, who gets to say what was intuitively found at the table with the group. I ask people to describe the outcomes of their rolls in many games, such as D&amp;D. I don't think that's actually attaching anything to the rules. Instead, it's defining something not defined in the game.<br/><br/>(Side note: I am sure there is some text somewhere that describes the GM's role in D&amp;D as describing the outcome of everything, but it's not an emphasized part of the system, as far as I know, and not part of the generally accepted ruleset of classic D&amp;D, which is an oral tradition at this point, anyway.)<br/><br/>Some modern games define who says what when instead of leaving it undefined. There's a lot of reasons for that. Some of mine have been in order to show people how a game can run if you reverse your group's normal social rules about that. The key part for me is that the definition of who says what when in a game does not define by absence those rules in a game that does not include them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_252877">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252877/#Comment_252877" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T12:32:59+00:00" title="January 26, 2010 12:32PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The snarky but still somewhat true answer is "'Story game' means 'any game that I like'."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_252896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia" title="Beth_in_Virginia"><img alt="Beth_in_Virginia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/848/nJ1OEZUHTPPTR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Beth_in_Virginia">Beth_in_Virginia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/252896/#Comment_252896" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-26T13:19:40+00:00" title="January 26, 2010  1:19PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2010 1:22PM by Beth_in_Virginia.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm inclined to agree with Nick that that is the effectively correct definition.<br/>Personally, Sam, I'm in your "first" group - I prefer games that structurally support us in caring why said bullets are flying to begin with, as opposed to how they're getting there. At the same time, I think games like Storming the Wizard's Tower are elegant (read: simple) enough that they could be fellow travelers of story-games, or at least close cousins. <br/><br/>The more I think about it, Nick, the more I think that your definition really is the only useful/applicable one - if we aren't going to be crassly partisan (haha) and whip out Creative Agenda (which I prefer to do, but I limit myself when I'm here; when in Rome, etc.), then yeah, "story-game" is an imprecise term.

I guess when I start thinking about what the line of delineation is, I think about two things: who gets to say what and how the story comes about.

On the one hand you have <i>Paladin</i> \u2014 which I like quite a bit, I should say \u2014 which is more traditionally laid out and on the other hand you have <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i>.  Under Jason's definition they're both story games, but under the "rules" by which I do my semantic sorting they are different beasts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253048/#Comment_253048" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T04:50:31+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  4:50AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always felt that story games was a term used to prevent arguments over definitions, like the "well, Capes isn't <i>really</i> an RPG" ones that have plagued us for awhile.

After all, a story game is a game whose central, defining characteristic is that it involves a story, just as Risk is a tactical war board game, and thus centrally involves elements of simulated tactical warfare with figures on a board.<br/><br/>Rules, as the limitation of possibility, are central to any game. I can play Risk with my friends and concurrently create a shared narrative ("I declare war on the United States of Europe following the underhanded betrayal of its leadership regarding the treaty of the previous fall, and furthermore declare that henceforth my Neo-Roman Empire will..."), and it is indeed the outcome of events in the game that "allow" the narrative to take its form, yet the rules themselves do not delimit the game space in such a way as to force a narrative to come into existence.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a game like DitV <i>compels</i> the creation of a shared narrative. If the group of players actually follow the rules, as published, and do not simply abstain or refuse to act, then a shared verbal narrative will inevitably arise. It seems to me that this is the key defining aspect of a story game: its rules, by constraining possible actions in a certain way, compel (and do not merely allow) the creation of a shared narrative.<br/><br/>This might sound like nitpicking, but I think it has fairly significant ramifications. Most notable, a simple "toolbox" of rules is not necessarily enough to make a game a story game, unless the rules also somehow consistently drive play towards the creation of a shared narrative.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>[Story games are] a broader category than "RPG", but there are also many RPGs that are very poor "story games" by this definition, as the tools they provide (or the way they are typically played) do not reliably produce good stories.</blockquote>\nWith my slight change of emphasis ("allow" to compel), I think this phenomenon is well accounted for. The problem is not precisely that many RPGs fail to reliably produce good stories (though this is true), but rather that whether or not a given RPG does indeed produce good stories is merely coincidental, since the success or failure to do so it not directly implicated in the rules. In other words, most RPGs have no explicit rules about story creation, and thus any story that arises is not (directly) attributable to the game-- it is, at best, a graft by those players who, like us, enjoy meaningful stories.<br/><br/>This is why, for example, I don't consider Diplomacy a story game; although it is certainly possible to create a story while playing Diplomacy, the former does not necessarily stem from the latter. Thus, I think it is useful to think of our hobby as having multiple aspects. On the one hand, we have story games proper, and generally (I think it is fair to say) we derive the most enjoyment from these sorts of games. On the other hand, there are games that are conducive to Narrativist play but which are themselves not strictly story games (I would include here DnD). I play all sorts of games, and I enjoy playing DnD in a Narrativist stance, but I also recognize that there is a categorical difference between DnD played in Narrative stance and a story game whose rules compel the creation of a shared narrative. (I imagine that the same happens for, e.g. a wargamer: DnD is conducive to tactical wargaming, but for the "full" or "pure" wargame experience, most wargamers would instead be most strongly drawn to a game like Warhammer 40k).<br/><br/>That's my two cents. (Sorry if I sounded critical, Paul; I didn't mean to. I just wanted to highlight the difference between a game "allowing" for or being conducive to story game behavior versus a game compelling story game behavior, since I think it is a significant but sometimes underestimated difference).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253107">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253107/#Comment_253107" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-27T09:21:15+00:00" title="January 27, 2010  9:21AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There have been attempts to answer these questions on the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=A_Story_Games_Primer" rel="nofollow">Story Games Codex</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253679/#Comment_253679" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T08:10:30+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  8:10AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Stephen,<br/><br/>I know what you mean. When I was writing that post, I hesitated over that word, "allow". But I decided to go with the softer version, because I don't really see a rigid definition we could all agree on. And it's probably because everyone has a different idea of the word "story". I could easily say, for instance, that my group of 11-year old roleplaying friends find that D&amp;D "compels" the kind of story they want to tell: a bunch of adventurers go somewhere scary, some blood is spilled. If that's the kind of story they're looking for, I'm not sure that Dogs in the Vineyard will "compel" a more meaningful one for them. I'm pretty sure I could write up a town that could be solved by choosing to side with one particular faction and shooting all the rest, and that's probably what these hypothetical gamers would do (assuming, again, that it's the story they're looking for). <br/><br/>So, I see a ruleset as allowing the players to produce the kind of story that they find sufficiently meaningful and/or satisfying. If it does so reliably, then it's a good design. My focus is more on the "reliably" than on the "allow", if that makes sense.<br/><br/>So, you may be right, perhaps. But I'm not sure enough of that to post that as a definition, personally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254078/#Comment_254078" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T11:39:30+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 11:39AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I see. What you've said makes a good deal of sense to me.<br/><br/>In my previous (rather long, I now see) post, I think I was coming around to a similar point of interest. That is, I am also interested in what leads to a reliably interesting/meaning story for the players involved, since I think that increasing this reliability is the key to increasing enjoyment of a game.<br/><br/>So I guess the question at stake is how to increase the reliability of a game to deliver the sort of story that is promised. Now, there of course are wildly varying factors (not least of which are the personalities and group natures of the players involved), but-- all else being equal-- it seems to me that the ruleset is one of the most important aspects of the problem.<br/><br/>Specifically, I think that a set of rules which expressly focus on evoking a certain sort of story and/or narrative play will be more consistently successful than a less focused set of rules (this is intimately related to System Matters). <br/><br/>Still, your example regarding DnD is a good one; DnD does, in its own way, yield a story that may be relevant to some groups of players (including a much younger version of myself). But I can't help but think that DnD's rules <i>focus</i> on stimulating a wargame experience, and simply treat as barely coincidental any story that accompanies the wargame. Of course, this will be what some players are looking for, but I'm not sure that qualifies it as a story game. (You are right to note that this is where we would start debating what a "story" is, if that was a major issue, and likewise whether or not this would make it a story game with poor design or rather not a story game at all.)<br/><br/>But the thing that I've really been thinking about recently, and am most interested in, is whether a "sandbox" or "toolkit" style of game can provide a reliable story gaming experience (without, as it were, the players excessively working to develop a narrative beyond what the rules require, since this can virtually always be done and thus virtually always lead to a story game type experience). To rephrase somewhat, are there any games whose rules lack clear focus on compelling story-game behavior but yet consistently yield compelling stories (when played "by the book")? If there are such systems, I cannot think of them now, but I'd love to hear if there are.<br/><br/>(It occurs to me that this is in some ways a rephrasing of Sam's original post: if all of the narrative activity in a game is "player-provided," does that game properly qualify as a story game? Certainly the ultimate <i>experience</i> might contain a compelling story, but is the game itself a story game? That is, is there a clear line from rules to story experience, or are the players instead the originators of the story experience in all the relevant, meaningful ways?)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254082">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254082/#Comment_254082" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T12:02:24+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 12:02PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2010 12:03PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stephen P</cite>But the thing that I've really been thinking about recently, and am most interested in, is whether a "sandbox" or "toolkit" style of game can provide a reliable story gaming experience (without, as it were, the players excessively working to develop a narrative beyond what the rules require, since this can virtually always be done and thus virtually always lead to a story game type experience).</blockquote>\nOh my god, that parenthetical has not only eaten the rest of the sentence, but your entire point and maybe the whole thread.

Players have to come to the table to "story game", that's for sure.  They can do that with anything ranging from My Life With Master to Monopoly, if they want to.  I don't think that's the issue <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  The question is, how can rules reliably <i>help </i>these players with this pursuit?<br/><br/>For one, the rules focus of a game determines how much of the handling time is spent with various activities.  D&amp;D spends a lot of time on combat.  That can be a central part of your story, but for my personal preferences, I like something that leaves more of the handling time for character interactions outside of combat.<br/><br/>Also, in D&amp;D, characters can die in combat even if there's no story-related reason for it.  Again, sure, it can fit with your story (particularly if you're telling war stories).  But for me, that's unsatisfactory and leads to me investing less time and energy into my character's personality and more into keeping them alive.  So I prefer games where I don't have to worry about all of my investment vanishing due to a few bad rolls, which allows me (notice: "me", not "everyone") to create deeper stories.<br/><br/>So yes, players need to be on board with telling a story.  And with sufficient commitment, they can do it with any kind of game, or even without any games at all.  But rules can help structure this whole experience in one way or another, thereby possibly facilitating or hindering the kind of storytelling a particular group wants to do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254088/#Comment_254088" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T12:20:47+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 12:20PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christian Griffen</cite>Actually, Jason, I don't think your definition is bad for designers.</blockquote>\nHm, true.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254189/#Comment_254189" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T23:24:50+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 11:24PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>This leads to the conclusion that story games are only those games that produce a story when the players of the game hate stories and do not wish to pursue them and expend no effort to pursue them.</blockquote>\nFrankly, this misrepresents the issue. As Christian points out, the issue is how rules affect the play experience. I find it surprising that you claim that what qualifies as a story game is unrelated to the rules. I, like most everyone on this site, fully agree that players can create a story play experience without reference to the rules-as-written (e.g. in Chess or Monopoly or whatever). But does that mean that suddenly, magically, the rules don't matter?<br/><br/>The truth is that rules <i>do</i> shape the play experience, which is why many of us constantly work on designing rules more conducive to creating a story gaming experience. Christian's example of DnD pinpoints one way that DnD is not conducive to story gaming behavior. DnD is not terrible, but also not great,* at providing a conducive environment (as it were) to creating a story game experience, while Dogs is, in my experience, reliably successful at doing so.<br/><br/>But perhaps I should approach the question in a different way. One way to reliably create better stories is to work with your gaming group to learn techniques for better story gaming (or to find a new group that has those skills). If I understand the OP's intention properly, this is not aspect of story gaming we are concerned about here. We are concerned about the second aspect: whether rules have an impact on the reliable creation of meaningful stories.<br/><br/>My own opinion, which I shared for the sake of argument, is that a story game needs requires development not just regarding (1), but also regarding (2). Indeed, insofar as a game is about the constriction of possibility through rules, (2) is central to the "game" part of "story games." In other words, my idea of what a story game is involves both player-behavior and rules design-- if either is deficient in a way that reduces the reliable creation of meaningful stories by those involved, then that game is, <i>to me</i>, not a story game.<br/><br/>So, responding to Sam's original post, I don't think that Recon is a story game, though it can be played in a way that results in an interesting/meaningful narrative (just as any, imo, almost any activity in life can be).<br/><br/>* In my opinion, and I know some will disagree.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254190/#Comment_254190" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T23:41:04+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 11:41PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2010 11:48PM by JDCorley.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Stephen P</cite>But does that mean that suddenly, magically, the rules don't matter?</blockquote>\nNever said that, try it again.

Neither of you are wrong, you're just not talking about the same thing.<br/><br/><br/>My opinion is that if you're talking about actually playing games (which is, in fact, what's being talked about), then talking about them strictly in terms of design is missing the point entirely.  Saying Recon is absolutely a story game is 100% true when you're talking about sitting a bunch of people down at a table to play it as one.  It seems like the real question would be "what do real human beings do when playing Recon that makes it into a story game?", not "What did the game designers do that makes Recon not a story game even though we all know that people often play it as one?"  (The latter of which is a question that turns the already-awful term "story game" into something totally counterproductive.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254231/#Comment_254231" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T08:27:27+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  8:27AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Right. It's more a question of fitting the right tools to the right people. If you're trying to tell a story like the hobbit's perspective of Lord of the Rings, then Dogs in the Vineyard might give you as much (or more) trouble than something like D&amp;D. There are a lot of "hidden" factors in the soft machine: the needs, skills, and desires of the players. That makes discussing design alone difficult (but not impossible, I think).<br/><br/>However, I have a question for the theory-heads out there:<br/><br/>The conversation here is interesting to me, because I think a term like "story games" depends a lot on the context where it is used. Stephen seems to be trying to define the term so he can differentiate story-empowering RPGs from less story-empowering RPGs (that don't help him reliably create a good story).<br/><br/>On the other hand, I often use the term when talking to non-gamers, which means I am trying to define it so as to distinguish games with meaningful and interesting fictional content (like an RPG) from games that do not have anything to do with stories whatsoever (like Scrabble or Checkers).<br/><br/>But, now, here's the funny thing:<br/><br/>The Story Games Codex defines the term as follows: "A story game is a game in which the players create fiction, and the fiction can in turn influence the play of the game."<br/><br/>But I've played quite a few games (and designed some) where the fiction can't influence the play of the game in any measurable way. For instance, consider a game like this:<br/><br/><b>Choose three random words from a dictionary. Now start telling a story using those words! Each player, in turn, writes one sentence, contributing to a growing story.</b><br/><br/>Not a great game, obviously, but one can imagine a more evolved ancestor of this game being a lot of fun (perhaps <i>Happy Birthday, Robot</i> could be a close-by ancestor). Now, I would definitely consider that to be a story game. Is it not one, by the definition from the Codex? (Not that it matters, in the large scheme of things--it just seems like it could be an interesting point of theory to discuss: the effects of the fiction on gameplay.)<br/><br/>Is that because this definition is more interested in differentiating RPGs from other games? Or is it simply incomplete? Or does the fiction of a game such as hypothetical game above affect "game play" after all, just not in a clearly mechanical sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254236">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254236/#Comment_254236" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T08:55:23+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  8:55AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul T.</cite>Is that because this definition is more interested in differentiating RPGs from other games?

I think it's because non-mechanical advice is portable -- it is useful to me literally every single time I sit down to play a game, every time I run a game, or every time I think about playing or running a game.  Good non-mechanical advice can make every single game I participate in better.<br/><br/>When these topics start veering in the "but here's how you should design a game to ..." and "this game is not designed to ..." directions, they become much less interesting and useful.  I mean, I imagine they'd be great if I was in the process of designing a game, but that's kind of a limited audience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254327/#Comment_254327" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-01T14:28:10+00:00" title="February  1, 2010  2:28PM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I think you got my intent wrong <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>I am on the first stage, seeking to excise them. And then, when I know the rules create what I want them to, then I want you to inject that. The perceived issue I have a problem with is exactly this portability, that you could take this advice and not only have a great game, but the great game would result from this advice, and perhaps even from this advice only, or, less extreme, the reason your game has a Tarantino feel to it rather than a Jerry Bruchheimer is the advice, though we supposedly craft rules to fit the fiction/vibe we are seeking.<br/><br/>Good advice <i>is</i> golden, and can result in us having the desired effect both sooner (because it takes time for things to roll, and for players to see implications, at times), and stronger (like getting a vaccination). I just don't want these to replace rules.<br/><br/>My biggest mechanical interest? Social Contract Rules. Not just rules about constructing them, but rules that interact with the social contract of the group, or where people make pacts. The best example I can think of is the Psychology die in Burning Empires.<br/><br/>But also, for the other side, I think good advice is too rare, advice that actually tells you how to play the game, unpacking all that we find obvious?
