I have no way of telling how many people have downloaded the pdf, so the conversion rate could be anything. That said, none of the games have really gained traction outside my regular group. If one ever does, I'll probably have a better idea as to how sales may or may not be affected.

It's pretty darn cool. I really really like the whole "rumors about X" thing, and the alchemy wheel is totally boss.<br/><br/>I do think, however, that you've made two missteps: one with a rule, and one with presentation.<br/><br/>The rule where the GM chooses and crosses out one of your Three Most Important Things before play -- that's not finished. At first, I balked at the idea entirely and strongly, which made me have to think about it. And I figured out what seems so wrong about it to me: what <i>should</i> happen is the GM picks one and crosses out, and then the player decides what was gained for that. Because, y'know, Equivalent Exchange. Ok, so I betrayed my beloved so-and-so, GM decides that -- I should get to decide why I did that, and what I gained for it. And it totally makes sense for me, as a player, to pick something disappointing! It gives me meat for my character. I mean, dude in the comics inadvertently killed his brother to resurrect their mother, and <i>it didn't work</i>, which was awesome.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the second thing. Equivalent Exchange is all over the resolution mechanics, given how you can effectively exchange consequences for success. So, the system fits quite well, thematically. <i>But you never say anything about this</i>. I think that's a mistake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rosaline" title="Rosaline"><img alt="Rosaline" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rosaline">Rosaline</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286807/#Comment_286807" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T13:46:02+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  1:46PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marshall,<br/>\n<br/>\nI was one of the playtesters for Ring of Changes. I agree with what you're saying about equivalent exchange, it's sort of a theme. Given it was a one month project, Ben didn't have time to flesh it out. I'd recommend that the idea be pur forward through a flavour story, rather than mentioned in the rule. This would also make sense, since it wouldn't allow the core rules to be adapted to another setting if it was stated as a rule, not flavour.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith respect to the loss of the most important thing, however, I distinctly don't agree with you. The thing that's missing is the stressing that your characters are supposed to be awesome, but to become as good as they are, they have had to give something very dear to them up. The thing you get in return is being a dirigible wing commander, or a highly respected administrator, or amazing combat skills. But all the while, there is this scar on your life, eating away at you. The loss serves as a melodramatic hook (If you've played Feng Shui), and should be the stuff of nightmares, keeping your character awake at night, made all the worse by the fact that not only are they still alive, but indeed they have become all the more successful since that day the mine collapsed, or your sister's house was burnt down, or you were exiled.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286828/#Comment_286828" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-16T14:42:55+00:00" title="August 16, 2010  2:42PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 16, 2010 2:59PM by Marshall Burns.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I get all of that, but the text <i>doesn't say it</i>. It ought to. As it stands, the GM takes away one of your things, and there's not much guidance as to what to do with that fact. I get it, but somebody without the proper grasp of situation and character mechanics isn't necessarily gonna get it. That's all I'm sayin'.<br/><br/>Situation mechanics are hugely and tragically neglected in RPG design, historically. It gets relegated to "good GMing" and not enough people talk about it. Which is <i>crazy</i>.<br/><br/>EDITED TO ADD: This is important because, although I get it <i>now</i>, I wouldn't have gotten it two years ago. Not before reading stuff on the Forge and Anyway and Todd Alcott's livejournal, and overhauling the Rustbelt into its current form, and so on.

I'd steered well clear of the phrase 'Equivalent Exchange' to try to make sure the game didn't seem to derivative or rely too heavily on familiarity with the series, but I think I went too far in that direction and avoided talking about the concept, too.<br/><br/>In most of the monthies I've not bothered including a 'how to GM' or 'what is role-playing' section on the basis that it eats up valuable writing time and that my target readership already has a grounding in the basics. They'd certainly be stronger with those things addressed, but under the time pressure it's a case of what else I would have to forego (rather ironically, for this game).<br/><br/>I'd definitely make that aspect more front and centre- probably stressing it more in the character creation section and making it clear that the characters' advanced ability or position owes a lot to the sacrifices they have made to get there, either as a literal consequence of the loss of a Most Important Thing or more nebulously. I'd certainly resist having a concrete, stats-based reward, no matter how heavily linked to the fluff it was. Maybe I should stress the prospect of weaving the event into the character's history more strongly.<br/><br/>I still like the rules-mandated GM cruelty aspect; although many systems give the player the ability to signal to the GM some aspect that he would like to have dragged into peril, as a GM I often feel my choice is between making a hollow threat and being a dick. That's not helped by the perhaps somewhat trad attitude that flaws of that kind are a means to get extra points in what you want and 'fluff' that shouldn't impinge on the game too much. By laying the list out during chargen and hosing one of them right off the bat, it sends a strong message the threat is real and the character will have to sacrifice something (his own success, his friend's success or his principles) to keep them safe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287578/#Comment_287578" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T12:34:43+00:00" title="August 19, 2010 12:34PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2010 12:35PM by Marshall Burns.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Queex</cite>I'd certainly resist having a concrete, stats-based reward, no matter how heavily linked to the fluff it was.
