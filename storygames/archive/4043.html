These will be rolled, and one of them will be assigned to a chart.<br/><br/>The chart consists of three broad themes, each of which is sub-divided into three topics that are, in general, in opposition.  I have no idea what these are, but for the purpose of explanation let\xe2\u20ac\u2122s say they are, in one theme, earth, water, and fire. <br/><br/>Here's the "scene outline" at start of session:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/new_scene_thing_01.jpg"/><br/><br/>By putting a die against a theme topic, you are making a statement about the importance or worth of that element in the story.  Within a single theme, no two dice can have the same value.  <br/><br/>When all three topics within a theme have a die associated with them, that triggers a scene that is based on the three values and what they tell you about the larger theme.  Is it water-6, earth-4, and fire-2?  That\xe2\u20ac\u2122s a very different outcome than fire-3, earth-2, and water-1, or earth-6, fire-2, and water-1.  <br/><br/>One cool and maybe useful property of each thematic distro is that once the third die is in place the total, minus five, is a range between 1 and 10.  Perhaps there is a list of scenarios for the \xe2\u20ac\u0153completion scene\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/><br/>If you end up in a situation where you have no dice that will \xe2\u20ac\u0153fit\xe2\u20ac\x9d anywhere based on their value (possible late in the session), you handle this in some clever and brilliant way like bumping an already-placed die\xe2\u20ac\u2122s value by one.  <br/><br/>Here is the scene chart  later in the game:<br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.meekmok.com/sassy/images/new_scene_thing_02.jpg"/><br/>At this point there's already been a "fourth scene" triggered in the first theme (earth, fire, water), and another is about to be triggered no matter where the next die is placed.<br/><br/>I'd love some feedback on this.  I'm still fuzzy from sleep so maybe I'm missing something.  Sorry it is so vague; I don't have a game to point this at to fill in the generic bits yet (although I have several tasty candidates).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90438/#Comment_90438" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-25T17:04:06+00:00" title="August 25, 2007  5:04PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lemme play with this in my braincase for a bit.

Make it thirteen scenes: each time a theme has a "fourth scene", one of its dice is placed in the big "Theme One" box.  When all three big Themes get a die, you have a final scene for the whole game.<br/><br/>Similarly, you could create sub levels below earth/fire/water/etc., making a fractal structure.  Then you can scale the system from a single session (13 scenes) to a whole campaign (13 sessions, each with 12 scenes).  Possibly, players could request sub scenes in the middle of a session, for narrative or mechanical reasons.  <br/><br/>Similarly, you could have conflict resolution reflect the fractal structure.  Each conflict might just be about placing dice, which determines which aspects are most important in resolving the conflict.  Like in the Andy/Shane/Jason conflict, each gets a number of "votes" equal to the die they had placed on them: Andy may get the six through luck or skill, but maybe Shane and Jason decide to team up against Andy and combine their four votes and three votes to overrule him.  Or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90506/#Comment_90506" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-26T13:43:28+00:00" title="August 26, 2007  1:43PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My mind is bending.
