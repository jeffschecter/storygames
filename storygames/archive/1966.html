                    I saw that tidbit about "we played X" in the niceness thread that wasn't really about niceness after all, and I figured I'd do my part.<br/><br/>So Wednesday night was the third play session using the latest rules tweaks for Galactic, and they're humming like a finely tuned espresso maker. It's Matt Snyder, John Harper, Chris Chinn and me, over Skype, now using Graham's fucking brilliant dice roller.<br/><br/>We've managed 2 to 2.5 hours at a time, due to life and time zone differences and stuff. I figure that with the short play sessions and the slowerness of online play we've probably done in three what could be done in one in person.<br/><br/>This tweak is drastically different from anything any of you poor volunteers has tried out, and I apologize for your sacrifice. This new stuff is way fun, and maybe it's different enough that if you play again it'll feel like a whole new fun game. Did I mention it's now fun?<br/><br/>As the designy guy, I'm thinking I got something right when every single conflict has one of the players, maybe even me as GM, agonizing over decisions. There's heaps of tension, and several aspects of the game have reached a critical point where lives may be lost and relationships severed.<br/><br/>I guess I should explain what's new: the quest building/resolving thing, for one; and the new split-purpose nature of conflicts. <br/><br/>To complete the game, you have to complete three quests, and as a player you decide what the quests are, sorta like kickers. Like maybe you say, "I need to find the lost shipyards of Fallon-Fe where scientists where engineers millenia ago were developing a powerful prototype starship." And you fill in a couple extra details, like name a location, a character and maybe a faction, along with a kind of cliffhanger starting scene, and the GM preps from there.<br/><br/>Anyone who's played PTA may well have wondered what's up with the nebulous difference between plot scenes and character scenes. In Galactic, each scene is both, and each conflict is both. Winning the plot aspect of a conflict helps you complete the quest, and winning the character aspect of the conflict helps you build loyalty with your crew. You can win or lose each aspect independently, and there's some fun agony involved in where to put the seemingly inadequate handful of dice.<br/><br/>The game also builds off the idea of Budget in PTA, except how the GM earns it is a little different, and there's a bit of strategy involved now in spending it.<br/><br/>So as for the story we maked, there were old rickety space stations, weird underground library complexes filled with traps, a deserted colony world, and a huge alien fortress built into an asteroid. Conflict involved zen-ninja diplomacy, exposing a fraud, escaping manhack-like defenses, a prison break, a perilous leap across open space in an emergency vacc suit, and plenty of trust building and losing.<br/><br/>Hopefully John, Chris and Snyder will chime in. If anyone has any questions about my occasionally vague comments above, fire away (early playtesters, find out how I listened! I really did!). If not, just sit back and wait impatiently, because I'm totally excited to rock with this game.<br/><br/>Also, Johnzo, what's up man? Seems like ages.                </div>

                            This game is so much fun! Slightly impaired by not being face to face, but still fun.<br/><br/>Galactic has hit that awesome game-design sweet spot where the players are groaning and bitching every turn but they're smiling the whole time. "Oh man! This sucks! I want to save the world and I want Santo to trust me again! What do I DOOOO?" It puts the tough choices right in your face, and you feel the burn when you have to make a sacrifice. There are just no easy answers, which is what the game is supposed to be about, so rock on.<br/><br/>I'm also really enjoying play with Matt, Matt, and Chris. They're a swell bunch of guys.                        </div>

Whoah.  That reads like an ice cream menu, man.<br/><br/>I'm interested in hearing more about your experiences with Skype.  I'm bummed  to hear you're taking a 66% efficiency hit with it.  I've had a great experience with VOIP gaming; my old crew and I picked it up quickly and I've even played with people I've never met in real life and it's all been pretty smooth.  I've been meaning to write up some stuff about our use of it, but I haven't really got much to say except, holy crap, I can now game in realtime with people I haven't gamed with in a decade.<br/><br/>I'm kinda surprised there's not a lot more talk about skype-type gaming on indie forums, since the indie community is so far-flung and the get-togethers are so legendary. 
<blockquote>Also, Johnzo, what's up man? Seems like ages</blockquote>
Lots of stuff.  Gaming's been swell lately; I've been running traditional short-shot strong-GM stuff, really deep in my comfort zone.  I've got a Space 1889 AP brewing from a completed game last week, and next month I'm running Dungeons &amp; Savages for SGA -- but after D&amp;S, I'll be pitching a game that's a little more hippy so I can get in on that collaborative creative goodness.  Because, really, that ice cream menu above is a damn fine advertisement for the story-games style.                        </div>

<blockquote>Whoah. That reads like an ice cream menu, man.</blockquote>
Big fat chunks of it were player created, too. I prepped a few setting elements and some characters, but a lot of it was done in play. I think I've almost made it as easy to prep as Primetime Adventures. I was like, man, I made PTA easy to prep because I hate prep. Shouldn't this game stay in the family?
<blockquote>I'm interested in hearing more about your experiences with Skype. I'm bummed to hear you're taking a 66% efficiency hit with it.</blockquote>
Maybe it's only a 63% hit. I could be exaggerating without meaning to. It is definitely slower, although there's something of an adaptation curve going on, I think, where we're getting a little quicker each time. I think the lack of visual cues creates some inertia, making it harder to cut away, start new scenes, etc. Plus Galactic has some heavy switching of roles, and I suspect that adds to the online confusion. We can't all see each other's sheets readily. I keep forgetting who is whose crewmembers, etc. Less trouble with a traditional one-party group? Probably.<br/><br/>Really, though, Graham's dice roller is a godsend for that game. As much as I liked Adam's mod on the Foundry, I like the interactive sense of seeing the shapes and lining the dice up for comparison. It really feels like it would in person.<br/><br/>I'd like to try a Skype playtest with another group to see what's consistent. Maybe the slow part is me!                        </div>

Oh, yeah, I could totally see where that would be a stumbling point.  Perhaps some kind of parallel chat where you could list the current roles would help?  So for every new scene, someone could generate a headline in chat with all the pertinent info for the scene for easy reference?<br/><br/>I think it would be excellent for Galactic to include tips or rules-mods for playing online.  It would be like getting a game from the future.

Like I said in the other thread, I'd definitely be up for a Galactic playtest.<br/><br/>edit: reduce overuse of "totally"                        </div>

                            I can't play that game Graham is talking about, as I won't be near my home for a big chunk of that time. Plus the thought of getting a new playtest doc formatted while I have Xmas and finals makes me shake violently. James N has also expressed interest in a Skypealactic, so maybe later in January I can fish around to see if there's a weeknight.<br/><br/>Incidentally, I'll be back in Seattle in a week and a half. We should do lunch or play Silent Death or something, unless you're leaving at the same time.

That's a neato idea. I fear the speedy obsolescence, but I think you just added a few pages to the book.                        </div>
