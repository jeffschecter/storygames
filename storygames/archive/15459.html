Players may find the English version website here: http://www.stratisimperia.com/<br/>\n<br/>\nOverview:<br/>\nPlayers start by both choosing a nation to join from a range spanning the Earth, and then a province within that nation to control. Next, the player builds up the economic base of that province, creating and upgrading factories, power plants, along with various other resource extraction facilities and manufacturing buildings. With this economic powerhouse of a province, the player proceeds to create the military units (creator controlled) desired (Air, Land, and Sea) by that player to support the goals of either world domination or the defense of liberty (through superior firepower of course).<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayers do not operate in a social vacuum though, they may use in game tools to coordinate their individual effort with the other player controlled provinces within their nation. They can trade resources and finished products, allowing for the production efficiency of product specialization.<br/>\n<br/>\nTogether, the players use additional in game tools to elect national administrators (monthly service terms), and together decide on both the military goals for their country as well as the plans to implement them.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf war is the path chosen, then the players coordinate their various individually controlled military forces to see the conflict to a successful conclusion.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional features:<br/>\nThe action takes place on a global map containing over 20 million hexes<br/>\nOver eleven thousand provinces in 75 historical period countries<br/>\nHundreds of technological and equipment inventions<br/>\nOver 35 types of land, sea and air units from the Second World War period<br/>\nFifteen technological levels for every unit type<br/>\nTwenty-five types of buildings<br/>\nFive types of province infrastructure (roads, rail, and so forth)<br/>\nEighteen different raw materials used in powering the economy<br/>\nSeven types of diplomatic relations<br/>\nRealistic combat engine<br/>\nThousands of military units led by hundreds of player leaders<br/>\nDiscover the reality of country management during the Second World War.<br/>\nCooperate with hundreds of players on-line and change the fate of the world.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe game is free.
