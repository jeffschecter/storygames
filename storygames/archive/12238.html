Our final non-home stop was at the home of Joe Mcdaldno, the designer/writer of <i>Gun Thief</i>, a game I had the pleasure of playtesting a while back (he also created <i>Ribbon Drive</i>, which I will come back to). Since Joe had kindly invited us for an (excellent) breakfast, we popped in and hung out, and then after food, we got to playing a quick game of <i>GT</i>. (For clarity, I'm going to italicize the title of the game, but not the role of the same name).<br/><br/>For those who are unfamiliar, here's the basic summary: Gun Thief tells short, one-shot stories of tragic criminals, the forces that push them into rough situations, and the Jagged Women that tease them and fire them up. At the end, the Gun Thief either lives and loses it all (save the one special thing) or wins big and goes out with a bang. It creates play for crime stories in the vein of Ed Brubaker, Frank Miller, or Quentin Tarantino.<br/><br/>It's designed for 3-4 players and to be played in about 1 hour. We had 3, so that was perfect, and I think play took roughly an hour (it had to, since we had 6 hours of driving ahead of us).<br/><br/>Having played the Gun Thief in the playtest group I had been in, I called the Law; the Law is the closest thing <i>GT</i> has to a gamemaster. The Law frames scenes, creates antagonism for the GT, and is one of the key narrators of outcomes. Thomas -- my traveling companion -- chose to play the Gun Thief. The GT is the protagonist of the tale, and has lots of hard choices to make. Thom's GT was named Sledge, and he was a big brute of a man who had recently gotten out of jail after serving about 6 years for unnamed crimes. That left the Jagged Woman for Joe. The JW is a bit of a misnomer, since that player will play multiple roles in the story: every major female character, in fact. Sometimes they are trying to help the GT, but more often, they are trying to hurt him or use him.<br/><br/>The GT player starts play with a few items, and each item has an adjectival tag: Thom's items were "trustworthy buddy, tainted money, tainted Camaro, and old-fashioned gun".<br/><br/>The game tells us that the Law has to frame the first scene for the GT, based on certain limited options, none of which are particularly happy. I decided that the GT was just about to find out that an old rival was back in town. In fact, the old rival was already established and it was Sledge who was just back in town, but it worked OK. I decided that since his car and money were "tainted", then we'd start play with him stealing them both from the garage of said rival.<br/><br/>Once the scene is framed, the JW gets to add a twist, again chosen from a select list. Joe added a ringing phone, and on the other end of it: Sledge's old girlfriend, from before he went to jail, and the mother of his kid... who was now apparently hooking up with the rival, who I believe was named Ricky.<br/><br/>Bang, that's conflict in GT. Narration proceeds, bouncing back and forth between all three players very naturally. Although each player has a "role", it becomes clear almost immediately in play that good, binding ideas can come from anyone at the table. Details about the world, the people in it, and the environment are contributed by everyone, and presumably can be vetoed by any player that has jurisdiction over that, but we never had a veto that I can recall.<br/><br/>When the scene reaches a natural climax, the GT player has to choose three outcomes from a list of five. To end this first scene, Thomas chose to "get what he came for", "keep all of his items", and "get the girl". The other outcomes are "gain a new item" and "get out unharmed". Whatever he doesn't pick is specifically targeted by the end-scene resolution. Meaning that because he chose to "get the girl", then the old flame had to come over to his side, but since he DIDN'T pick "get out unharmed", it was up to me to hurt him. The narration of the end of a scene can take as long as it has to to ensure all of the loose ends are wrapped up.<br/><br/>Each progressive scene is framed by the Law, but it doesn't have to follow immediately from the end of the previous one. Which is why we jumped from Sledge getting in a car chase and crashing (getting harmed) to him, the old flame (Carla? So many names, I can't keep them all straight), and their kid, standing in a late-night diner, with Sledge and Ricky holding guns to each other. The JW's twist is that a female detective, looking to prove herself is sitting in the next booth over...<br/><br/>So, we play out scene after scene, with Sledge getting in deeper with the Irish mob, the cops, and some smugglers... until the big conclusion.<br/><br/>I won't bore you with details. <i>Gun Thief</i> teaches quick (Thomas had no idea how to play, and did an admirable job as the game's lead), it plays quick (it wrapped up very nicely and neatly in around an hour), and it tells really great, meaty crime stories.<br/><br/>The games in my experience tend toward the bloody, but they certainly don't have to. It wouldn't be totally out of the realm of possibility to have a comedic game of <i>Gun Thief</i>, but you'd need to be clear about it beforehand. It can also be sexy, but the sexiness of it is on a broad spectrum, and easily adjusts to the players' comfort levels.<br/><br/>I'm happy to add more detail if needed.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/>-Adam                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
