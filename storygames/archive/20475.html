I shouldn't generalize story so, but most stories have one protagonist, at least at one time.   I'm sure story will change over time, and likewise game. Life. Story. Game. Those are some incredibly big, broad, and uncertain words.<br/><br/>I'm almost fine with role-playing games not having a protagonist.  Or some kinda collective protagonist, made up of player characters.  I'd say that the recent Avengers films have that kind of protagonist.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450049/#Comment_450049" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-15T23:31:08+00:00" title="December 15, 2015 11:31PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Since "protagonist" just means: the leading character or one of the major characters in a drama, movie, novel, or other fictional text.

In Nerver av st\xe5l, there's one player who's the protagonist (and the only character who's referred to in the first person). In PTA, there's usually one protagonist at a time (the spotligt player). In some other games, I've often felt that this or that character is really the protagonist. When I played Apocalypse World, I felt my character was the protagonist, but then she died and my new character was not; the protagonism shifted to a different character. I find that especially in games with many players, some play more supporting roles whereas others are more the ones we empathise with. But yes, sometimes there are multiple protagonists, which to me is the same as saying there are multiple, intersecting stories. Like in some books and movies. In many games we're playing several stories at the same time, but mostly there's just one protagonist per scene.<br/><br/>Then there are "adventure party" type games, and that's moving more away from the way I'm used to seeing stories, and there protagonism isn't really a helpful concept, I think.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450067">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450067/#Comment_450067" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-16T15:06:25+00:00" title="December 16, 2015  3:06PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 16, 2015 3:08PM by catty_big.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Sure.

Or each player is a kind of polyagonist, i.e. acting on their own <i>and</i> as part of a greater whole. However, the OP has unintentionally raised a phenomenon that has bothered me for some time, to whit the fact that individual members of a player party frequently look as though they're thinking mainly or completely in terms of their own contribution to the story, paying little or no attention to what the other players are doing, to the extent that there does indeed seem to be several protagonists. I've often  wondered how GMs deal with this if/when they spot it happening.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450074/#Comment_450074" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-16T19:12:51+00:00" title="December 16, 2015  7:12PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My approach has usually been to find ways to tie their interests to those of another player.

The word protagonist just means lead role.<br/><br/>The "protagonist" in Kingdom is the Kingdom then, or I'd argue, more likely whomever we are viewing events from at any given moment. Because it can also mean, "in this colonial struggle, the main protagonists were Great Britain and France". It is just whomever is getting the lead role and screen time, who the story is about.<br/><br/>And sure, more than one person can be the protagonist, like Nathan said in the OP about the Avengers. The protagonist is only "the most important" by the definition that it is the character(s) getting screen-time.<br/><br/>If a story were to be written about a janitor on the original Death Star, then that janitor would be, by definition, the protagonist. Not Luke, nor Leia, Han Solo, Darth Vader, or any other "important" character. It's the janitor.<br/><br/>I'll bite JD. Sure I suppose most RPG characters don't change. But that has to do more with us the players, than the protagonist. We're still playing the lead role in every game, because we focus on a character, even if that character is actually something like a kingdom or an entire series of events, a la Microscope. Though again, we tell stories via characters, even in Microscope and Kingdom. Those characters, who get screen time are the very real world definition: the protagonist. Just like the janitor on the original Death Star, in a story about the janitor. <br/><br/>EDIT: A protagonist doesn't have to change to be the protagonist. For a good story I could argue that it is necessary for the protagonist to change, but sadly, that still isn't the actual definition of the word.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450108">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450108/#Comment_450108" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-18T22:22:05+00:00" title="December 18, 2015 10:22PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's something there that I can't still put the finger on, but I can't just rest the case saying players are the protagonists. I mean, okey, you can have a story about things that happen to a lot of people, those are the protagonists. They don't have to change themselves, you can just have them change the world around them and it's still a valid story. They don't have to make important changes, maybe just witness something to give a point of view to... the reader... wait. I believe now I see what we've been doing wrong the entire time.<br/><br/>Check the <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/story" rel="nofollow">definition of story</a><br/><br/>So, by definition, an RPG is NOT a story. Whatever you remember and tell to other people about the game, that IS the story!. Playing an RPG can be compared to writing / conceiving the story and the PCs as well as the NPCs are constructs that help us to create that story. It won't be until later that they will be presented as protagonists. When you recall the entirety of the facts , situations and how they resolve, it will be easier to find out who is the protagonist: either the one whose point of view is narrated, the one who made most of the things or the one to whom those things happened. Most probably there will be overlapping criteria and more than one protagonist. Even the GM could tell the story then using one of his NPCs or monsters as a protagonist!<br/><br/>So there, problem solved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul" title="Irminsul"><img alt="Irminsul" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Irminsul">Irminsul</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450109/#Comment_450109" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-18T22:32:35+00:00" title="December 18, 2015 10:32PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Total agreement, yes! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450114">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450114/#Comment_450114" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-12-19T13:53:17+00:00" title="December 19, 2015  1:53PM">December 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 19, 2015 1:54PM by Rickard.">edited December 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This post is probably relevant to the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/20438/the-role-of-story-in-rpgs" rel="nofollow">The Role of Story in RPGs</a> thread but that thread has gone too far from the topic so I wont post it there.\n<blockquote>So, by definition, an RPG is NOT a story. Whatever you remember and tell to other people about the game, that IS the story!. Playing an RPG can be compared to writing / conceiving the story and the PCs as well as the NPCs are constructs that help us to create that story. It won't be until later that they will be presented as protagonists.</blockquote>\nI agree, and I will link to three blog posts that explains it better than I ever could (with references!).<br/><br/><a href="https://annikawaern.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/why-i-dont-believe-in-emergent-narratives/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://annikawaern.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/why-i-dont-believe-in-emergent-narratives/</a><br/>A summary: "Hence, in order to create coherent stories out of random coincidences (with or without linking to pre-scripted story content), <i>the player</i> must be active in making the connections.

This is fundamental to the core experience of what makes a RPG a RPG rather than some other kind of story game--that most players take on a role or roles which are their lens into the action.<br/><br/>Fundamentally, the definition of the protagonist is the same as that of a PC (to the playing player):<br/>1. They are a primary viewpoint character.<br/>2. They have agency, and thus their actions and decisions is one of the primary causes of their story.<br/><br/>Of  course, in a functional game, the other PCs will often be strong secondary characters -- just as in a book or movie, other characters than the viewpoint character -- the protagonist or progagonists (if there is more than one viewpoint character) will be strong secondary characters and it will make the overall story stronger.  But they might be antagonists, or supernumeraries--from your POV.<br/><br/>This dynamic is one of the things that makes LARP design challenging.  A good larp generally has -every- PC as a protagonist -- from their own POV.  Of course, the player may well know that they are a villain, or that their primary role in the game is going to be spying on people and serving drinks.  But part of what the player brings to the table is--given tools to work with--the ability to have their character act in the world such that, when they tell their actions back to themselves, their character was the protagonist of their own story.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
