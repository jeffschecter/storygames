In the cinematic action genre, they don't really make sense.<br/><br/>Dual wielding is rarely as tactically efficient as wielding a single weapon, if we're considering any kind of real-world situations. So, unless the genre tropes permit it (e.g. John Woo movies) going dualies usually breaks my verisimilitude (e.g. if you fire that gun single-handed it will break your wrist.) As far as like swords are concerned, you're gonna usually want a shield in your off-hand, or a dagger if that's your style. If we're doing God of War, then sure, duel wield the severed skulls and spines of dead gods, sounds badass.<br/><br/>So, to answer your question: yes, I always thought the way it was handled in D&amp;D3.x was fair and made for an interesting combat option. I built a Rogue-Assassin that used two short swords and mostly tried to get as many sneak attacks off in a round as possible. If the additional attacks hadn't been penalized, it would have been such an optimal build that everyone would do it.<br/><br/>When I hack and design games now, "Off-hand Penalties" isn't something that ever even enters into my head as I prefer lighter weight systems. <br/><br/>ALTHOUGH!<br/><br/>I've been toying with Jonathan Walton's Fingers on the Firmament and I'm starting to think that 'Off-Hand Penalties' might be a critical point in the rules, as they involve actually holding hands.

When the players succeeded, yes, that lefty penalty was vital to the fun.<br/><br/>I think there was also some random Warhammer result of "arm destroyed" and there was fun suspense over seeing whether it would be the character's strong arm or not.

If you're in a boffer/stick game that involves force beyond touch, it's considerably more difficult to generate power with your off hand -- you'll need to swing with your body a little harder to do more than feint than you do with your dominant hand.  What does this add to a pen and paper game...<br/><br/>But yeah, outside of game balance stuff in D&amp;D, no big deal.

This has happened, but not often enough for a rule to crystallize. Ruling penalties on off-hand maneuvers makes our game better by motivating interesting detail that feeds into the clarity with which the players imagine fictional positioning, which in turn provides legitimacy and inspiration for consequences. Basically the same reason that makes e.g. tracking encumbrance interesting.<br/><br/>Dual-wielding weapons, on the other hand, is a common enough occurrence that mere rulings are not enough - you need rules. However, D&amp;D also is of such a level of abstraction that how dual-wielding fighting styles work properly has very little to do with off-hand penalties. (Traditionally they are related, but the tradition's wrong on this - probably because D&amp;D gamers traditionally are pretty vague on how sword-fighting works.)<br/><br/>I've never enjoyed the character building game, so in my D&amp;D the off-hand penalties have nothing in particular to do with character builds. The closest you get is that individual characters might be defined as being skilled in different fighting styles, which in turn tend to use the off-hand in different ways.<br/><br/>But yeah, basically I think that off-hand penalties are no more ludicrous than many other detailed rules that attempt to provide pin-point focus on particular types of fictional positioning. It's not for all games, of course, but we can easily enough point at games where that sort of thing is well justified.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412119/#Comment_412119" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-17T07:58:30+00:00" title="April 17, 2013  7:58AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>Off-hand, I can't think of any...</blockquote>\nBut on the other hand...<br/></blockquote>\nNope, even without the off-hand penalty.

For me, the way Dungeon World puts the damage die on the class rather than the weapon is the type of differentiation that I find fun for more fast and loose play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lula" title="Lula"><img alt="Lula" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/409/n3KBYVIFT76IM.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lula">Lula</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412160/#Comment_412160" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-18T00:14:27+00:00" title="April 18, 2013 12:14AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the responses, guys; the gradient of reactions here is interesting.<br/><br/>The implementation of off-hand penalties in certain games (D&amp;D, WH40KRP) confuses me because it's often a flat penalty to doing stuff with that hand, or to attacking with that hand but not parrying, or to parrying but not attacking, etc. If the reason for the penalty existing is to create realism, I'm a little surprised, because I always thought handedness wasn't an absolute, but was instead a function of what you train to do with each hand. My favorite example is forks and knives. I'm very much right-handed but if I try to use a fork in my left hand and a knife in my right, instead of the other way around, I'm a mess. I also can't really (apologies for TMI) unhook bras with my right hand.<br/><br/>In martial arts practice, I've seen much less handedness than I've seen sidedness. A lot of people have a side they roll or fall or cartwheel better on, which has no ostensible connection to their dominant hand. It also happens with kicks: I know I tend to kick more with my right leg. When punching, I tend to defend better with my left hand and attack better with my right hand; and when grappling it's all mixed up. Within the styles I practice, know relatively few fighters who are significantly less competent with one side; Rob, you're one of the only ones I've heard of.<br/><br/>I don't know if my experience is representative, but as far as I can tell, dominance isn't a left-hand or right-hand thing as much as it is a whole-body thing that has more to do with training habits than with a particular side always being dominant. Like, if I had to represent myself in a RPG like D&amp;D, I'd have to stick the off-hand penalty to a different side for every individual thing I do, or negate it for certain things. But attaching the negative penalty to one side or the other as an abstraction when the motivation for it is realism kind of slides it into an uncanny valley for me.<br/><br/>"I am not left-handed" is still cool, but it's much easier for me to see that in terms of on-the-fly declarations like in FATE; like, lots of people have a tendency to leave a certain body part more open than others for the same reasons they have a dominant hand, but we don't have left-rib-vulnerability penalties by default, although they're great fodder for maneuver aspects.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_412163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412163/#Comment_412163" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-18T03:51:58+00:00" title="April 18, 2013  3:51AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2013 4:00AM by David_Berg.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe armedness or leggedness is different than handedness?  Maybe fine motor finger control tasks are different than large body motions?<br/><br/>Because I've always used my right hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder for everything that requires an arm, my right arm is much better trained <i>in general</i> than my left.  Give me a task to do, chances are that my right arm has done something similar at some point and my left arm hasn't.<br/><br/>In martial arts, I always jab left.  But if you make me switch stances and jab right, my right is just as good, despite 5% the reps.<br/><br/>For a given fictional character, just about any configuration would strike me as plausible.  Due to my own experience, I'd rate "generally worse at doing things lefty" as most likely, though.  Unless it's some extremely specific lefty task, like fretting a guitar.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_412184">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/412184/#Comment_412184" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-18T09:44:13+00:00" title="April 18, 2013  9:44AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 18, 2013 9:45AM by Paul_T.">edited April 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/biffboff">@biffboff</a> beat me to it!<br/><br/>Off-hand penalties are awesome if you're a swordsman and you take an injury to your arm, so now you have to fight with your off-hand.<br/><br/>What's more interesting, though, is some kind penalty for <i>fighting a left-handed opponent</i> when you're not used to it!<br/><br/><a href="http://vickyenglishscamelot.blogspot.ca/2010/08/left-handed-sword-fighting.html" rel="nofollow">Here</a> is some discussion on this topic by interested amateurs.<br/><br/>But, overall?
