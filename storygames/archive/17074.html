I met cool gamers, played and ran fun games, ate good food, and successfully balanced gaming and chilling. My favorite parts of the weekend, though, were the goth dance parties on Friday and Saturday nights at a club near the convention center \u2026 which is odd, because incidents of creepiness/harassment on both those nights enraged me.<br/><br/>Incident #1: As my friend +Lia Lilley and I walked through the club towards the dance floor, a tall white man wearing a baseball cap, T-shirt, and shorts approached her and asked her name out of nowhere. She introduced herself, and the guy told her she was very beautiful. We slipped away without more conversation; Lia complained that she\u2019d been fielding those kinds of advances all weekend.<br/><br/>For most of the evening, we could see that guy in our peripheral vision, but he didn\u2019t approach, though his eyes frequently and clearly tracked Lia. He didn\u2019t dance, just stood over on the side of the dance floor with a drink while Lia and I danced with the rest of the floor. But when I went inside to get water, he suddenly sidled up to me.<br/><br/>He said hi, introduced himself, and immediately began to interrogate me about Lia. We\u2019re talking full-on Scott Pilgrim have-you-seen-a-girl-with-hair-like-this overdrive. \u201cWho\u2019s your friend? What\u2019s she like? She\u2019s very pretty. But I\u2019m a pretty good-looking guy myself, too. You know how sometimes someone just catches your fancy, and you know they\u2019re different, they\u2019re special? Yeah. It\u2019s like that. She got a boyfriend? Fianc\xe9, really? Huh. So what do you do? Graduate school, eh? Is she an intellectual also? Oh yeah, feminist theory, that\u2019s cool. I\u2019m into that. I was in college once, dropped out though. Now, with the fianc\xe9\u2014is she in love, do you know? Huh. Hey, let me buy you a drink. Okay. I\u2019ll see you around.\u201d And that was it for him, until he came up to me later and asked if I \u201chad any intel for him.\u201d<br/><br/>YEAH WHAT THE FUCK<br/><br/>Incident #2: The following night, my friends and I were all a little more sensitive to the threat of harassment than we had been. Incident <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> may not have quite reached the level of harassment, but goddamn was it creepy. We made sure at least one of us had eyes on each of the rest of us at all times, and searched the club thoroughly whenever we lost track of someone. I was happy to go along with this plan, though I thought it was a little paranoid until, well \u2026<br/><br/>I\u2019m dancing with Lia and a couple of other friends when I see this guy dressed sort of like Alex from the Clockwork Orange film grinding with a very pretty girl wearing mostly fishnets and not much else. I\u2019m just glancing at them, but something in her body language strikes me as a little weird: he\u2019s intensely focused on her, holding her tightly in such a way that she can\u2019t move away from him, while her hands are moving away from encircling him and placing them on the front of his shoulders, as if to push him away (though she can\u2019t because of how he\u2019s gripping her).<br/><br/>Then Alex shoves his hand under her skirt and grabs her ass, really hard. And, like, lifts her up by it. And I turn to Lia and I\u2019m like, \u201cI need your help with something.\u201d<br/><br/>We dance towards the creeper and his prey and I reach out to pat him on the back and say, \u201cHey guys! Come dance with us!\u201d The invitation breaks Alex\u2019s drunken focus for a moment, long enough for his vise-grip on Fishnets to slacken a bit. Lia takes that opportunity to slip between Alex and Fishnets and latch on to Fishnets, dancing close to her and looking as possessive as she can without betraying our rescue mission. Fishnets gets it, thankfully, and snuggles up to Lia. Meanwhile, Alex looks squarely at Lia\u2019s ass, turns to me, points at it, and asks, \u201cSo, uh \u2026 is this yours?\u201d I\u2019m thinking, what, her ass specifically? Yeah, I\u2019m in a co-op with the dudes who own the rest of her body parts. Much as I would love to have vocalized that I only said \u201cyes.\u201d<br/><br/>He then asked, \u201cDo you mind if I \u2026\u201d and gestured towards Lia\u2019s ass, canting his hips forward as if to oh my god this is so gross I have to stop describing it. I just said, \u201cNo, you better not. Yes, yes I\u2019m sure, you really better not,\u201d and danced between Alex and Lia\u2019s ass until Alex walked away to find easier prey. Seriously, I am a noted ass enthusiast and this episode was enough to put me off them for, like, a good ten minutes. Fishnets was very sweet and grateful, and danced with us for a while before heading off. I spent the rest of the night watching Alex intently whenever he appeared, making sure to block the way between him and my female friends, or to draw them away when he started to (ugh) chase after them.<br/><br/>It\u2019s days later and I\u2019m still angry I saw this behavior. I\u2019m angry about all of the stories, many of them much more tragic, which this fiasco brought to mind. I joke about being the party\u2019s social tank, and I\u2019m happy to be, but I\u2019m incensed we need such a thing in the first place. My privilege as a young man also comes into focus here. So far, I have chosen to engage in every physical confrontation in which I\u2019ve been involved\u2014all of them to intervene against violence or harassment toward others. Each time, I have had the luxury of a few seconds to plan how best to protect others and myself. The threat of surprise attack against me is low, relative to that against Lia or other women I know. Violence hasn\u2019t been forced on me whether I wanted it or not since maybe junior high school. But were I to suffer this variety of aggression regularly, I would probably get in a lot of fights and a lot of trouble over it. Lia, on the other hand, has gotten in a lot of fights and a lot of trouble over it. If some guy were to come up and grope me like he did Fishnets, I would probably angrily eject him from the room; but Fishnets mostly just laughed his behavior off like she was accustomed to it and didn\u2019t care to think about it any longer. Which was probably the case.<br/><br/>I struggle to draw any positive, productive conclusion from these incidents. For all the satisfaction with myself I feel for having stopped what I stopped, it sickens me to realize my intervention was necessary. I could fume at the other dancers on that floor, at their not noticing what was happening to Fishnets despite their proximity and staring; but who knows how many similar incidents I\u2019ve failed to notice in the past? Who knows what I would have done were I as drunk as they? I know my own flirting must have unintentionally made someone uncomfortable in the past\u2014am I really so different from these guys?<br/><br/>I guess all I can say is: please don\u2019t stop talking about this problem. I know we all like to think of ourselves as civilized people with civilized friends who are respectful of others\u2019 feelings and differences, people with practiced social skills who know how not to make one another feel uncomfortable or unsafe; but Uncomfortable Questions Man and Alex grew up in the same world as we, around our same species and perhaps even our same cultures. They do not know how to treat women. Which means they do not know how to treat humans. So don\u2019t stay silent. We cannot afford to forget these dangers, lest they grow too close to us before they strike.<br/><br/>E\u1e63u grant me the cunning to guide my friends and close the way against danger.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387713">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387713/#Comment_387713" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-21T19:23:13+00:00" title="August 21, 2012  7:23PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 21, 2012 7:24PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited August 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, permissive kyriarchical rape culture is definitely a thing.

I'm sorry the guys coming up to your friends in the club were making you so uncomfortable. I'm a club goer and that's pretty typical behavior, gamers or no gamers. Unfortunately, to answer your question, I think that has more to do with the club culture than the gaming culture.<br/><br/>If someone was doing that to me and I didn't want it? Push them away. Look frantically around the room. Ask for help. Cut off the fetishistic interest in me or my friend's girlparts or boyparts by interrupting with a "hey, you're being pretty rude and thanks but no thanks." Forceful, polite, clear. I usually step in like you did and interrupt if I see a girl or guy who feels particularly trapped because they don't know what to do. Well done and good eye! It takes a group to spot these things sometimes.<br/><br/>To be clear, that explanation doesn't excuse the unwanted advances or inappropriate groping as described in your story.

Thanks for sharing this. I too have been in the exact same situation, albeit without the proximity of a convention. I've found that "club culture" in general is pretty despicable. Goth/fetish clubs are full of scantilly clad ladies which in turn draws out the assholes who like to get drunk and act a fool. I used to go to clubs fairly frequently with my fiance but the constant harassment got out of hand. She could not go ten minutes without being invited to a three-some. Multiple guys would constantly shadow her at any one time, and sometimes they would just walk up and put their arm around her or worse. Needless to say, it made her uncomfortable and lead to me having one too many almost-getting-into-a-fight moments.<br/><br/>Once, a giant skinhead approached her, while she was holding my hand mind you, and said something along the lines of "Why don't you drop this prick and jump on my dick?" He wasn't happy when she told him to fuck the fuck off, so he decided he wanted to fight me. When I told him I didn't want to fight, he started fronting on my girl. YES, this dude, standing a good foot and a half taller than my fiance, wanted to fight her. Good thing there were bouncers near by because him and his fucktard skinhead friends probably would have killed me and raped my fiance.<br/><br/>Once, I caught some sleazy ass homeboy hovering around my fiance's drink. When I grabbed the drink out from under his nose he glared at me and walked away. I poured the drink out because I was pretty sure he slipped a ruffee into it, then spotted him watching my fiance like a hawk. If I'm wrong and that dude was not trying to date-rape my girl, I'll eat my Pumas.<br/><br/>On occasion, my fiance used to go out to bars/clubs with her girlfriends. She no longer does this after a few times of coming home crying because the constant barrage of sexual advances, flirting, groping, and general wierdness just broke her down till she was emotionally spent.<br/><br/>Seriously, if you're a girl and you go to a night club, expect to get harassed, especially if you're looking sexy. If you're a guy going to a club, expect your girlfriend/fiance/wife/lady friends to get harrassed. If you go a night without harrassment, consider yourself lucky.<br/><br/>But yeah, I don't think this has anything specifically to do with Gen Con. People in general are assholes and night clubs are like a nexus of asshole. There's a good chance some of the assholes at the club also were Gen Con attendees, but that's not exactly surprising since I'm sure Gen Con had more than its fair share of assholes wandering around.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_387828">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mattastic" title="mattastic"><img alt="mattastic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/ldwgS.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mattastic">mattastic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/387828/#Comment_387828" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-08-22T19:21:59+00:00" title="August 22, 2012  7:21PM">August 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            And here's my buddy's story about it happen at this year's GenCon<br/><a href="http://www.doucheydm.com/?p=1079" rel="nofollow">http://www.doucheydm.com/?p=1079</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
