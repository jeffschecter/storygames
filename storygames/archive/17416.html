I\u2019ve been running two, mostly successful, games of Monsterhearts over the last few months and I\u2019ve discovered something interesting about how my style has changed since I was playing in high school.<br/><br/>I always had the problem that, if I planned something too far in advance, by the time that I managed to bring it up in play, I would be bored with it. I compensated by not planning anything at all, and keeping all my notes in my head, which lead to more dynamic, but ultimately unsatisfying games, as I was unable to maintain anything remotely resembling a coherent narrative. I ran several long Mage: the Ascension chronicles in which almost nothing actually happened.<br/><br/>Since I\u2019ve started running games again I\u2019ve run into the same problem. If I do too much planning, the ideas grow stale inside my head. Tabletop rpg\u2019s are slow, they take a lot of time to consume content, so it can be easy to plan three months of game content in an afternoon, and then have to throw out 3/4 of that work because your players did something unexpected. <br/><br/>My solution to this has been to do planning, but to assume that the things that I come up with before play are true for only a given value of true. I come up with some ideas that I think are interesting, but I don\u2019t stick to them if something better comes to me later. In short, I work out a set of hazy possibilities, and then revise them on the fly during play. Often half of my planning notes end up being objectively false later, having been invalidated by other more interesting things created during play. <br/><br/>I\u2019ve found that doing things this way makes my job easier. If my players come up with a cool idea, I can incorporate it without feeling like I\u2019m violating the established rules of my world. By avoiding long-range planning I can be more reactive. I can make incidental actions by the PCs important by building the world around their decisions as we play. This style, of course, won\u2019t work for everyone, but it works for me. My ideas aren\u2019t set in stone, and thus they are not in danger of getting stale or boring me. This lets me explore the world that the group is creating in much the same way as a player.<br/><br/>This style is not without its flaws. It\u2019s extremely hard to pull of symbolism or metaphor. I tried, in my latest game, to do something using bunnies as a symbolic element, and it failed horribly. I can see a lot of literary tricks that would fail without more concrete planning. Foreshadowing still works, because you can foreshadow things you haven\u2019t clearly worked out yet, but it means you have to be meticulous in your note taking so that you can remember what you\u2019ve been up implying in previous sessions. It can also put a lot of strain on you when the players do something out of nowhere. If you haven\u2019t written down what is behind the spooky door, then you have to be able to figure it out pretty quick. I make copious use of five and ten minute breaks, as well as cutting the scene to focus on different characters. One of the best ways of getting a few minutes to think in Monsterhearts is to make extensive use of the prevalence of cell-phones. <br/><br/>\u201cHey Kayleigh, you said you were probably going to call Ravan later right. How about later is now?\u201d<br/>\u201cYeah, sure, that makes sense.\u201d<br/>\u201cOk! Ravan! Your cell-phone rings.\u201d<br/><br/>I mentally picture this style of running games as \u201cPlaying with a flashlight.\u201d We\u2019re in a dark room and we can only see the things that are very close to us. The person running the game is holding a flashlight, which lets them see a bit further, but the vague lumpy object two rooms down might be a couch, a chair, a pool-table or a monster. Nobody knows. <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rickard" title="Rickard"><img alt="Rickard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/453/n3BOLPULLVMLX.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rickard">Rickard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394386/#Comment_394386" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T19:37:55+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  7:37PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting reading.\n<blockquote>In short, I work out a set of hazy possibilities, and then revise them on the fly during play.</blockquote>\nI usually just figure out the problems, but never the answers. That's up to the players to solve. By not having any answers, I'm more dynamic to go with the players plans, probably adding something that goes wrong in one way ("Yes, but", depending on the system). I started to do this because I noticed that I had a tendency to force my solutions on the players, making their plans harder, almost impossible, if they didn't do what I had planned, and that is not really a fun game.<br/><br/>Another thing I do is to write down the NPCs' agendas. By having just a goal, I can easily create consequences of the players' actions and therefore creating a more dynamic play. "OK, the mummy wanted that sceptre so he should probably turn up now." When concentrating on creating consequences caused by the NPCs' agendas, I don't really have an ending. It all depends on how the players act.\n<blockquote>Foreshadowing still works, because you can foreshadow things you haven\u2019t clearly worked out yet, but it means you have to be meticulous in your note taking... /.../ If you haven\u2019t written down what is behind the spooky door, then you have to be able to figure it out pretty quick.</blockquote>\nSomething I tend to do all the time is giving hints of something I don't know I will use, like repeating "fruit bowl", presenting an improvised NPC, asking the players random questions "What did you dream last night?" and things like that. Thoughts that pops into my head that I think would be cool to use. I jot down the answers and make them appear if I have to improvise something on the spot.  People that the players have created or thoughts they revealed may come up in the plot if I have to go outside my notes (or if they are cooler than my notes).<br/><br/>This, of course, also encourage the players to bring more to the adventure than just appearing in-character, when they notice that I actually using their ideas and letting their actions create consequences. That what they do actually counts.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_394389">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394389/#Comment_394389" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T20:16:00+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  8:16PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was really hoping to hear about playing in the dark with a flashlight.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_394391">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S" title="Aaron_S"><img alt="Aaron_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/780/nLP7HPA6K2AES.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aaron_S">Aaron_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/394391/#Comment_394391" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-10-22T20:42:42+00:00" title="October 22, 2012  8:42PM">October 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            mease19 - me, too.
