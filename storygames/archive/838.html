                    This is brief recounting of the advice I'd give anyone who's interested in playing IH.  We ran something like a dozen sessions going from level 1 to level 6 using the book.  I know there's something like a 12 page errata thread on their forums, but I <br/>haven't kept up with it...<br/><br/>EL<br/><br/>IH PCs are more powerful than D&amp;D PCs.  They can easily take on EL +2 higher than what a D&amp;D group could.  Many have suggested that at higher levels this evens out as monsters become more magical, but I haven't heard any AP proving it yet.  You may want to make an EL adjustment, otherwise PCs will level up really fast.  <br/><br/>Location &amp; Action Zones<br/><br/>The GM's guide provides rules on Action Zones, which are basically rules to set up cool stunts using the environment.  How hard is it to swing the mast around causing it to smack someone in the back of the head?  What's the damage?  How long is someone blinded when you throw hot stew in their face?  What's the save?  These are the kinds of things you can build using these rules, and what makes the game really fun.   <br/><br/>Make sure to include at least 4-5 options in any given combat location, point them out to the players ("This chamberpot blinds someone for 1D3 rounds if you toss it at them!"), and scatter them around the level.   Make sure some of the cool stuff is easily accessible and close to the PCs when the encounter starts.<br/><br/>IH NPC Classes<br/><br/>The GM's guide also has a really smart idea for NPC classes, instead of tracking feats and spells, etc.  it just mashes the NPCs abilities into a few key abilities so you don't have to do all that much math.  On the other hand, the problem is that they're generally underpowered, maybe by as much as 3 levels, so you'll want to beef them up before using them.<br/><br/>IH PC Classes<br/><br/>On the other hand, IH NPCs who use PC classes can be utterly deadly.  I almost got a TPK with 2 NPC Harriers working in conjunction.  Remember, these guys have an EL +2 equivalent, so be careful before you throw them at a party.<br/><br/>Mooks<br/><br/>Mooks get demolished in this game.  It's fun, but you might want a lot of tokens or figures to keep track of them.  Our Man at Arms at 6th level wiped out half a pikeline by himself, using reach and cleave options...  Mooks also provide no real threat to PCs.  They simply lack the feat options and damage potential to really hurt anyone.<br/><br/>AoO's<br/><br/>IH changes the AoO rules, so D20 players will need to pay attention.  It's harder to get AoOs, and, in some cases, things like Reach lose a lot of value unless supported.  <br/><br/>Damage<br/><br/>Combat Challenges &amp; Stunts allow PCs to toss out LOTS of damage quickly.  Monsters that would take significant time in D&amp;D can get laid out really fast by PCs.<br/><br/>Balance<br/><br/>A couple of the classes are underpowered- such as the Armiger and the Hunter.  A couple of the classes seem a bit more powerful than the rest, like the Berserker or the Harrier.  Mostly, the big difference seems to be how you get effectiveness and how it can be used.  <br/><br/>The Hunter has to spend precious actions to get tokens, and then spends the effectiveness boosting others, but can't be too far away from combat.  The Armiger has to get hit, but the tokens you get is meager and what you can spend them on not so great.<br/><br/>In comparison, the Berserker gets tokens all the time, and they increase melee, which is what he's doing anyway.  The Harrier gets amazing levels of attack and damage for moving, and doesn't even need to build tokens to kick ass.<br/><br/>Trait Balance<br/><br/>Only a few traits stand out as worth getting.  You should either expect to see the group consist entirely of Mighty Build/Weapon Bond/Stat boosts, or else significant differences in effectiveness.  I'd probably come up with some alternative Trait options that are equally powerful, just to get a little more variety in there.                </div>

                            Mark-<br/><br/>It's definitely better than D&amp;D in that regard- even 1st level characters can Stunt and use Combat Challenges,  so everyone comes with more cool options right out the gate...<br/><br/>But- different classes get their sweet spot at different times, which is part of the balance frustration.  For example, Armigers don't even get their token abilities for quite a few levels, and Man-at-Arm's signature "Wild Card" feats don't kick in until 5th level.<br/><br/>You might want to start at 3rd level or so, just so that players can get a feel for the new abilities and options together- though I'd probably say like D&amp;D, 6th level + is where everyone gets very cool.                        </div>

<i>Hm, considering PC Classes for NPCs, the +2 ECL means nada, since the PCs get the same +2 ECL, so it balances.</i><br/><br/>This brought up a question for me: one thing I have tended to notice in standard D20 is that a straight class level character does not really equate into a CR rating.  A 10th level party tends to clean up a 10th level NPC faster and more easily than they would a CR 10 monster.<br/><br/>Does this hold in IH?  Is an IH NPC with 10 levels in Berserker as dangerous as a CR 10?  More dangerous, perhaps, because of the way so much of its power is wired to the class rather than items or spells?<br/><br/>How did you feel about the Arcanist class?  I know lots of fans (even Mearls himself) have been a little nonplussed about it.                        </div>

                            I almost got a total party kill with 2 6th level Harriers going up against 3 6th level PCs.  This was also before I figured out that IH PCs are actually EL +2, exactly, so I would have definitely been better off with just 1 Harrier and some back up mooks.<br/><br/>I think the big difference is that IH PC classes toss out damage way faster than normal D&amp;D types.  Especially when people start figuring out how to work Combat Challenges and Stunts to maximize attacks.<br/><br/>I didn't really look at the Arcanist Class- Mike Mearls had pointed out shortly after the game came out that the magic rules weren't really polished, but Monte Cook insisted that they be included... so...   Given the few other rough edges, I didn't want to put any time towards dealing with a magic subsystem as well.                        </div>

                            Yeah, it was definitely fun seeing the differences in play.  The 3 major differences from standard D20 I liked were:<br/><br/>- Characters are more self-sufficient.  You don't need a party to have an effective character.<br/>- Tactical round to round decisions as an individual are much more important.<br/>- Environment matters, because it's an endless source of stunts and choices, even moreso than D20's use for cover and forcing AoO's.                        </div>

Most of the advice I have seen is of the "don't use those monsters very often, if at all" variety--is it good advice?  Are there other things you have tried?                        </div>

                            I avoided the instant incapacitation monsters, which wasn't too hard to do given that we went from 1st to 6th level.  I'm sure by the point you hit 14th level + it'd be really tough to keep going with that.  IH does give a few options for such abilities- for instance, petrification naturally wears off after 2D4 days, or instant kill abilities drop you to -10 hp and then give you yet another save to not be instantly dead.<br/><br/>I'd probably run the other type abilities such as disease etc. as if they were poison of some sort- does damage to a stat and perhaps secondary damage.  That way, it's crippling enough the players are scared, but not so deadly it means instant death or incapacitation.  And then it comes back with time.                        </div>

<blockquote>By that logic, 3rd ed D&amp;D should look a lot like Everway.</blockquote>
Had the developers been hired to produce something like Everway because Everway had been wildly successful then maybe you'd be right.                        </div>
