If you are interested, the link to the Kickstarter is<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/565866321/mecha-combiners" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/565866321/mecha-combiners</a><br/><br/>Also, so you know, the rules have been rigorously playtested, the manuscript is ready, so there's not a lot of risk.  The Kickstarter's goal is to make a full color version that really does the game justice.<br/><br/>I appreciate you checking it out.  Thanks!<br/><br/>Chris                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
