I did have an enjoyable game with it, but realized why it wasn't a good match for my interests. I learned something about what I want from a game from Fantasy Hero.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't regret buying Dogs in the Vinyard. I originally purchased the PDF as an example of a game that really laid out what the game was about (not the setting bit, but what the actual play experience was about) and how to play the game. I ended up trying it out, and enjoyed it. I may not play it for a while, but I will play it again.<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't regret RuneQuest. I've had some lousy gaming with RQ, but I've also had some really good gaming. Plus, the chat I had with Greg Stafford when I had him sign my 1st ed. copy at Origins a few years ago was probably worth the $8.40 I spent on the book, and the incremental storage and transport costs that are part of the TCO.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games I regret are the ones that never got played, or worse, never even got read. These are examples of games that I really did get my money's worth out of.<br/>\n<br/>\nFrank                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_86662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86662/#Comment_86662" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T14:06:16+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  2:06PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's very, very few games I regret buying. Even if I never run them, they either have good ideas or are simply pleasurable reads. However, some highlights that I particularly don't regret buying:<br><br>Nobilis.  The best game in my library.  Now that it's hard to find for a reasonable price, I'm even more pleased to have this in my stable of games.<br><br>Spirit of the Century.  I pre-ordered this with very little to go on, except some RPGnet praise.  But it's blown me away, and though I didn't expect to find a pulp system to not only replace, but top the out of print Adventure!, I'm glad there is one, and pleased I have it.<br><br>HeroQuest. I got this hearing good stuff about the system, not sure what I would do with it, and found a system that I will be using as a generic system for quite a few other games I wanted to run.<br><br>Little Fears.  Although avidly awaiting the new version, despite some issues I have with the resolution system, it captures playing children really well and really helps put players into that mindset.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_86679">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/86679/#Comment_86679" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-08T14:31:33+00:00" title="August  8, 2007  2:31PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dogs in the Vineyard.
