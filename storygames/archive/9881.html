You might call this a bang although it's often more gentle than that. It's basically where the PCs discover that something is up. This might be at the reading of a will, the disappearence of a friend or a trek into the jungle to find some ruins.<br><br>Often this part of the adventure is written after you've decided on the nature of the threat. And it is almost always a threat. The players might want occasionally to play cultists but the usual heroic mode is to be trying to save something from the Mythos threat. And in the the manner of Liberty Valance, the way to defeat the Mythos is to use its powers against it and thus become tainted onself (see The Man Who Shot Joseph Curwen by Ken Hite).<br/><br/>Once you've decided what the threat is, then you can work out the ramifications of the threat and work backwards as to how the PCs become involved and forwards as to what the threat will do if not stoppped (a bit like a Dogs game).<br/><br/>The Mythos game is almost always plotted because it's a mystery game and part of the fun is in not knowing what is going to happen. You could use the Dogs method to generate a scenario, all you'd have to work on then is a plausible hook.<br/><br/>There are ways of impovising such games (<a href="http://www.pelgranepress.com/seepagexx/December2007-Steve.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>'s one) but you'd need players who are well versed in the Mythos to make it happen.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219565">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219565/#Comment_219565" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T08:33:45+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  8:33AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 8:37AM by Graham.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trail of Cthulhu is quite good for scenario structure. It goes something like this.<br/><br/><b>The Hook:</b> Something happens to draw you into the adventure.<br/><br/><b>Scene 1</b>...which leads you to a Weird Place where you Find Stuff Out.<br/><b>Scene 2</b>...which leads you to another Weird Place where you Find Stuff Out.<br/><b>Scene 3</b>...which leads you to another Weird Place where you Find Stuff Out.<br/><b>Scene 4</b>...which leads you to another Weird Place where you Find Stuff Out.<br/><b>Scene 5</b>...which leads you to another Weird Place where you Find Stuff Out.<br/><br/><b>Final Scene</b>...which leads you to the final Weird Place where it all comes to a head.<br/><br/>The Final Scene needn't always be a confrontation. It can be a ritual or, well, anything, really. My Cthulhu scenarios tend to end with the Investigators confronting the monster but unable to do anything about it.<br/><br/>Also, it needn't be that linear. Scene 1 can give you several clues, which lead to Scenes 2, 3 and 4. I like that structure much better, actually. Essentially, you dump players in A Weird Location, like a village, and say: "OK, in this village, there's a church, a pub, a library and a monastery on the hill.

It could just be that I'm not particularly good at prepping for a mystery or that I'm just not steeped enough in Mythos lore to just toss things out there. But let's say for example that the game is taking place in some random medium-sized town in Pennsylvania. A Chthonian has burrowed its way up from the earth's core and under this town. Some sort of small town secret society a la the Masons sees it as a god or god-like entity and has formed a cult around it. Is that an okay start for a first time adventure premise or do you think maybe there should be a mythos cult but no actual insanity-inducing creatures? Maybe just some books and some murder?<br/><br/>But assuming that's okay, we go about creating the scenes and the mystery. I get stuck right from the get-go, though. How does one come up with motivations for weird alien creatures beyond human understanding? Chthonians cause earthquakes and have mind control powers, so there's room for some hooks right there, but does it really matter what it accomplishes? Can we just handwave it and say, "Okay, the Chthonian mind controls this fellow to bring it these gubbins because... who knows, it's beyond human understanding"?<br/><br/>What sort of clues are typically used in a Cthulhu adventure? I appreciate the scenario structure you've provided, Graham, but I don't really know what sort of Stuff I should have the player or players Find Out. I mean, I can think of newspaper articles about periodic earthquakes going back over years and years, the society/cult forming right around the time of the first earthquake, maybe the cult interfering with seismologists or something period appropriate that's come to investigate the earthquake. It doesn't seem like enough, though, and coming up with a hook is quite hard.<br/><br/>It's probably obvious that I never read mysteries. Maybe I should get over my aversion towards pre-written scenarios.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219570/#Comment_219570" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T08:59:39+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  8:59AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 9:04AM by komradebob.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>It doesn't seem like enough, though, and coming up with a hook is quite hard. </blockquote>\nSomeone the players vaguely know has disappeared. Or someone important to an NPC has disappeared, and local aurthorites are dragging their feet. Or one of the PCs is an insurance investigator for the local mining company, and their charged with proving that it wasn't shoddy minig techniques that led to those deaths, so the company shouldn't have to pay out compensation.Or the PC Sensitive is getting drawn by dreas to this place like a creepier version of <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind.</i> Potato sculpture optional.<br/><br/>One thing to keep in mind is that many CoC adventures are run as one-shots, perhaps with characters that survive and re-appear in the next one-shot. Or not. Also, CoC players tend to come into the game without any real adventure-avoidance issues. CoC doesn't tend to be played sand-box style, where players hare off and start a bootlegging business or something.<br/><br/>The thing about that is: You can rely on the players to muddy things up from simple mis-understanding, and tracking down red-herrings that they've created in their own minds, so keep it simple.<br/><br/>The Haunted House is a classic CoC adventure for that reason. It's really only a couple of pages long, but with new players it's almost always memorable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219575/#Comment_219575" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T09:39:12+00:00" title="July 20, 2009  9:39AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps the Cthonian is being used to knock down buildings that are in the way of a big bucks building project, like a new supermarket.

I kinda think BRP Cthulhu was meant to be played with modules. They sure as hell sold enough of them. (Many of them fucking great!)<br/><br/>But I know what you mean - the monsters don't have motivations in the sense that we understand them, so how the hell do you get players to care about stopping them? Well, the Cthulhu Mythos also contains the biggest cheat for that question of all time: the monsters' actual plans are not what the players are stopping - it's the side effects (disappearances, insanity, murder, conspiracy) that are both evil and recognizable enough that the players will be motivated to stop them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219597">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219597/#Comment_219597" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T10:45:17+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 10:45AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I re-read CoC (several editions, in fact) last year, and what stayed with me was this sense that the game's writers actually presume many different forms of campaign; most significantly, it seems that the default campaign form should actually not be adventure-based, that adventures are only something you run as special events at conventions or such. By this I mean, it is more important for individual adventures to paint a total picture over time, as the characters come to be steeped in the lore and ultimately form some sort of organized mythos detective / mythos defence agency. Individual missions are not that important.<br/><br/>From this viewpoint, it's not that important to make your individual adventures ultra-elaborate or fraught with danger, as your goal is more to make a string of seemingly separate events that slowly develop into an organic campaign. It also gives you context for failure: it's OK for the characters to <i>not</i> solve an individual mystery: they can just take the weird artifact home, and sometimes later the GM brings it back in a new context, in which it makes sense anew.<br/><br/>This second, non-adventure-based model of CoC: that's what I want to write into a clearer, more playable form some day.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_219600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219600/#Comment_219600" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T10:48:53+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 10:48AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Read The Shadow Over Innsmouth or perhaps Steve will recommend something.</blockquote>\nIn original CoC they use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Case_of_Charles_Dexter_Ward" rel="nofollow">The Case of Charles Dexter Ward</a> as their model for scenario building.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_219603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/219603/#Comment_219603" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-20T10:55:23+00:00" title="July 20, 2009 10:55AM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2009 10:59AM by Bret_Gillan.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, maybe I'm making this too complicated.

The generic picture you get of a CoC party, with one dude each wielding a spellbook, a scientific/technological implement, and a shotgun? That's the good guys in "The Dunwich Horror."<br/><br/>I started improvising CoC scenarios only after running a dozen published ones. They're good practice. The adventures in Chaosium's "The Stars are Right!" are good, as are the ones in the Delta Green sourcebooks from Pagan Publishing. At the next level of prep/difficulty, there's Pagan's hard-to-find "More Tales of Terror", a book of situations with three possible explanations each, usually Mythos, occult, and Scooby Doo (a few T of Ts are printed in issues of "The Unspeakable Oath", too). The high-wire act is (apologies to Baker) Doggy-style, where you don't know The Answer going in. The key to success in that style is big-time player buy-in; if your players are Lovecraft fans, or don't mind reading a few stories as prep, that should be easy, since the genre conventions run so strongly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_221016">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221016/#Comment_221016" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T15:15:07+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  3:15PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think one of the key elements to stress in CoC scenarios is tragedy; for an (effectively) old-school game - the rules haven't really changed since its first publication - it makes for some dashed expectations. Published scenarios are the way to go, even if you just read them for the feel of it. The sanity system basically means that, no matter what short-term goals might be met, in the long term all the PCs are doomed. But read some scenarios to see how this happens - in Secrets of Kenya, for instance, there's a scenario about the PCs being captured by troglodytes and climbing a massive underground wall to try and escape - only they can't. That's it - no hope, no way out - just lots of horrific ways for them to fail. It's a game about tragedy, really, not just horror (although in every scenario I've ever played, and a few that I've ran, I've been genuinely scared).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221030/#Comment_221030" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-07-27T16:19:44+00:00" title="July 27, 2009  4:19PM">July 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2009 4:20PM by Bret_Gillan.">edited July 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Millsy.

He takes a picture with an ancient 110mm toy "spy" camera, then just leaves.  If you so much as approach him, he digs through his weathered duffel and hands you a photo album with pictures covering every day of the year to date, up through the day before yesterday.

Some paints over it within a day. A secret is being concealed. <br/>Each Investigator finds one open letter from the city to her. Other people have messages waiting. Some are threats. <br/>The homeless photographer is a missionary of sorts. <br/><br/>Judd, I agree with you on one point - you don't get it, yet. The OP wants help gaming in the Mythos tradition. That is what the rest of the thread is about. Maybe this thread isn't for you. Maybe it is!<br/><br/>And I don't see how my little seed is "bad Cthulhu", anyway. To me the crux of the Mythos is that it is so close to our world, except for that one crazy thing that cruelly reminds us of the universe's ability to go on without us. Tentacles are an accident. Secrets and revelations that drive their viewers to insanity are the essence. I see lots of potential here for secrets and revelations both.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_221997">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey" title="Steve_Hickey"><img alt="Steve_Hickey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/921/nXA31A51OBMEJ.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Hickey">Steve_Hickey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/221997/#Comment_221997" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-01T19:55:37+00:00" title="August  1, 2009  7:55PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, Judd.
