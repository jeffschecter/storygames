"uh..., it's *not* the real world, it's just a game?" It's like getting mad at like the Blade movies because "The real world <i><b>shouldn't have vampires</b></i>!

In a recent WHFRP game it was made clear that every niche had been filled and that the government was aggressively bureaucratic.  So if you came up with some trick for making money a) the tax collectors would be on to you, b) guilds would ask why you weren't registered and paying your dues and c) people would spring up and try and rip you off or replicate your idea until the market saturated.  One player commented that he found this world uncommonly bleak.  He effectively sees the game world as a series of problems and challenges that can be solved by quick thinking (usually in the form of a speech and brutal violence).<br/><br/>Of course, I do not take this view.  In fact, I tend to feel somewhat uncomfortable assuming the role of a hero.  Partly due to playing too many games in this vein and partly due to personal politics, I would be happiest as a GM and a player to play in a world where the actions of the characters have no repercussions beyond the local level.  Any problem that can be solved by a speech and a strong right arm is most likely not a problem I recognise as real and if I don't recognise a problem as real I tend to think that we're just engaging in childish power fantasies.<br/><br/>I actually think the desire to spend time pretending to be a hero is symptomatic of a cluster of character flaws.  I don't think it's particularly healthy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197019/#Comment_197019" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T13:22:43+00:00" title="March 15, 2009  1:22PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite> He effectively sees the game world as a series of problems and challenges that can be solved by quick thinking (usually in the form of a speech and brutal violence).<br/></blockquote>\nI'm not going to judge one style of play over another (that always gets me into trouble).But this is the sort of thinking that points people back to video games when drawing parallels.<br/><br/>Also, the notion that the <i>GM is supposed to entertain</i> needs to go the way of the dodo.

He creates a binary opposition, "player centered" vs. "world centered," and then attributes to the first a whole bunch of nasty player behaviors that do not necessarily derive from a "World exists for the players" style of play. Whining players demanding loot and XP from GMs might be indicative of immature players, but doesn't not necessarily flow from a game that is tightly focused on the PCs desires and beliefs, rather than being a sandbox. He goes on to attribute to the second a slew of impartial behaviors that have an arguably positive effect. However, there are plenty of negatives that can come from a view that the game should be as indifferent to the PCs as the game world is in the fiction. <br/><br/>So, I disagree with his conclusion that there are only two ways to look at it, one repugnant and the other benignly impartial.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos" title="Dyson Logos"><img alt="Dyson Logos" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dyson%20Logos">Dyson Logos</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197091/#Comment_197091" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-15T22:27:53+00:00" title="March 15, 2009 10:27PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I'm in an AD&amp;D1e; campaign right now that is VERY world-centered and not all all player centered that contains whining players demanding loot and XP.

This will, in turn, slow down the rate at which you gain levels (not necessarily a bad thing for some, but deadly boring for others).<br/><br/>It also makes the process of evaluating how tough a fight might be much more complicated: now neither the players nor the GM really know if the party can handle a CR7 encounter.  Obstacles which might have only been a slight inconvenience to a fully-equipped party (deep chasms, poisons, monsters with damage resistance, etc.) could be game-ending catastrophes.  If everyone was hoping to have a fun recurring game full of challenge, they might instead get stuck with an abortive mess of a game full of lopsided, totally unfair slaughter.<br/><br/>It's not impossible to do a low-magic, low-loot D&amp;D game, but it does take a lot more thought than many people who run that style of game are willing to put in.  It looks like a wonderfully modular game, and in many respects it IS, but they did a lot of work to make the experience/levels/CR/wealth-by-level guidelines all work together well without requiring much fudging (if any).  If you shift out one element of that (less wealth, for example), you really do have to pay more attention to the other elements and do a lot more heavy lifting, mechanics-wise, to keep the game running smoothly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197190">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197190/#Comment_197190" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T10:54:00+00:00" title="March 16, 2009 10:54AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan M</cite>.

I mean, if you run a superspy game and you <i>don't</i> have international diplomacy be essentially ineffectual or illegitimate, it's not just that you have a different political outlook, it's that you're not doing it right. Similarly in the kind of heroic (no scare quotes, just the root and origin of the word) Western or sword-an'-sorcery or libertoonian scifi you have an aversion to. So I guess what I'm trying to say is I actually share your aversion, and anyone who's given any thought to the setup should, but that doesn't mean that necessarily everyone that identifies this problem should throw the baby out with the bathwater. <br/><br/>I should start a new thread about this. I mean, I love pulp adventure stuff and am always touting men's adventure novels as module fodder, and you'll not find a more violence-enabling, misogynistic, racist pile of literary garbage on God's green earth. JM, you are not wrong to be essentially repulsed by the idea of someone rolling into our little frontier town to save us from the forces of barbarism and impose their civilization on us by the sword/gun/magic missile. But you have to do something with that idea to engage with the stories that are already out there, that provide the inspiration for things. You can deconstruct it, or minimize the components that are particularly nasty (most people don't incorporate racist slurs into their pulp action adventure, for example), but you have to be aware of the source material before you can react to it. <br/><br/>So what I'm trying to get at is essentially this: when you're looking at a story and thinking "hm, what about a story game", you have to be able to analyze the story and put the parts together into the game world. D&amp;D puts this responsibility on the GM for the most part, but the players can also play a part in it through their character design.  Some of the parts you are going to come across may be very, very terrible. And that's not a bad thing that you feel that way, nor an obstacle towards playing in a game of that genre (or even a game with those very, very terrible parts still in it!) In fact, it's the first step towards doing so.  It has nothing to do with any mental issue on the part of the players. Those elements were there, those elements are found eeeeevery-where you turn.  <br/><br/>Hope this helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197205">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197205/#Comment_197205" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-16T12:08:19+00:00" title="March 16, 2009 12:08PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with everything you say and by and large that's what I do.<br/><br/>However, while I enjoy the spinning, I do find it frustrating that it is always necessary.

If you see those as problems, the same problems are found quite a ways back in most cultures that I can think of off the top of my head.

The 'special' person going beyond cultural norms, changing the world, and bringing some kind of enlightenment to the poor normal folks is by no means restricted to RPGs, indie or otherwise.<br/><br/>Withholding any kind of value judgment about the archetypal hero, I think it's unfair to single out games for furthering the stereotype.

What I mean by that is a game may ostensibly be about a band of occult investigators, but really the meat of play is their home relationships, difficulties balancing investigations and jobs and their relationships with each other which may be based more on their shared knowledge of the supernatural thingy than any actual shared affection.<br/><br/>That's potentially a very mundane game, the supernatural element is there really the same way a murder is in a crime novel, to give people something to do while we explore the real meat which is their lives.<br/><br/>Take away that ostensible goal though, and you risk stagnation, with people sitting gazing at you like hungry chicks waiting to be fed, sometimes folk just draw a creative blank and the advantage of the ostensible plot is it gives them something to do at those moments.  "Hell, I can't think of much else to do with Tod's marriage and the bickering with Bob is getting old, maybe I should follow up that exsanguination clue and see where that takes me".<br/><br/>Of course, problems arise if for some the ostensible goal is more interesting than the actual goal, as then two players are having their PCs in arguments with their wives while two others are wondering what the fuck they're doing and why we're not tracking down the sodding werewolf already.  But then, that's where compromise steps in.  Compromise, in group activities, is ultimately unavoidable.<br/><br/>The heroic myth though, I have no real interest in it, it doesn't speak to me.  When I participate in threads about historical gaming, some choad always says "if you can't kill Napoleon (or whoever) what's the point?"  The point is, what your characters do matters to the milieu they inhabit, it needn't matter a jot though to the wider milieu, all it need matter to is that which is within the scope of play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_197985">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197985/#Comment_197985" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T06:38:38+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  6:38AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Compromise is good as long as it doesn't feel like capitulation.  It's the capitulation bit I struggle with.<br/><br/>I agree with you about how the mundane can find space for itself in and among the heroic and the fantastical but I find that players tend to require a good deal less prodding to engage with the fantastical than they do to engage with the mundane.  I'm guilty of this myself as a player and it's something I'm working quite hard to address but I think it's a universal problem.  The only time I've found it to not be a problem is when I've played with non-gamers.  They'll happily bicker and flirt but are more reticent to go chasing after werewolves.  To me that's a more interesting way of approaching the game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197992">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197992/#Comment_197992" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T06:55:24+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  6:55AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a universal problem in my experience too, I think it stems from how we tend to grow up as gamers.  Early games are all about the plot, the hole in the ground, the monster in the attic, over time we add in more elements but the plot remains.<br/><br/>We grow up plot focussed, and the rpgs we buy tend to be similarly focussed, the result is that it's easier to chase the plot than to explore the subplot which may be much more interesting.<br/><br/>Part of it too is that everyone is involved in the plot, everyone has something to do.  If we're playing though through Bob's marriage problems, what does everyone do while Bob is playing that bit?  This is something I was trying to get to grips with in my Gangbusters game, and which I intend to return to.<br/><br/>But yes, it's a problem.  Your comment about non-gamers makes me think even more though it's a problem born of unexamined (or inadequately examined, or just plain bloody hard to shift) assumptions.  A mate of mine ran a CoC game once, a horror was seen by the party, he asked them what they did.  Some went for weapons, some for cover, some ran away, but one who had never gamed before said "I completely lose it" which is of course a more credible and perhaps more interesting reaction than any the others.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_198003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M" title="Jonathan M"><img alt="Jonathan M" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jonathan%20M">Jonathan M</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198003/#Comment_198003" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T07:15:52+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  7:15AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I remember playing a free-form post-apocalyptic game with some friends and one non-gamer spent the entire session trying to make sure that she had a decent place to sleep, a boyfriend to keep her warm and a ready supply of booze.  Once things went weird she effectively shut up and stopped paying attention.  I completely agree about gamers being trained to approach games in this fashion.  Even something as simple as not waiting for the plot to come and find you is something that most gamers have to learn to deal with.<br/><br/>Gangbusters was interesting because we all split off and did our own thing but occasionally there would be a need for co-operation and in cases where the characters' agendas were not completely aligned a good deal of roleplaying would flow from the negotiations required to secure co-operation and access to the other character's resources and contacts.  Two thoughts about it though :<br/><br/>  A) I think the game would benefit from another non-police class.  Something like 'city hall employee' or 'politician' might be a good way to go.  The bigger the differences between characters' agendas, the more interesting roleplaying there is to be had.  It's too easy for the cops to just systematically work together on everything.  It was only when the PI or the Reporter had to be factored in that stuff got complicated and therefore interesting.<br/><br/> <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> I think that the XP rules should be tweaked in order to better reflect the fact that cops are all about arresting people while agents should be about gathering inteligence and building larger cases.  The first time round the negotiations between agents and cop usually revolved around who should take the credit but there was never a moment where the cop was told not to arrest someone or the cop had to play ball with the feds in order to get access to intelligence.  That's partly why I, as a cop, was effectively running around playing a kind of uniformed detective rather than working my patch.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198006">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198006/#Comment_198006" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T07:27:58+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  7:27AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dan's idea of a weekly poker game between the characters I thought was a brilliant one for Gangbusters, it tied the PCs together in a non-professional context, gave them a reason to know each other and made them contacts for each other - so that if the private dick needed a photographer he called the journalist, if he came upon something heavy he called the cop or the feds.<br/><br/>The non-police class is a good idea actually, a very good one.  I'll have to think about that, lot of work though.<br/><br/>On B, that's a good point, but it's a GM problem rather than an xp problem I think.

One of the recurrent difficulties of "mundane" play is that it tends not to have a through-line. Take your "I totally lose it" player - yes, it's a very human response. It also kills that character's place in any ongoing story stone dead. Virtually every time I have seen that sort of thing in play, it's had one of two effects: either it becomes the center of gravity itself (every other character organizes around responding to it), or the character is quickly and efficiently sidelined so that other people's interests can be pursued. How do you meaningfully <b>engage</b> with that sort of thing without it killing the momentum of the <b>group's</b> play dead?<br/><br/>Indeed, this is a problem for fiction in other mediums that tries to eschew narrative. 400 pages of novel that consists largely of mundane people engaging with petty problems --- without a larger thematic link --- may be art, but it's rarely a good read.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198013">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198013/#Comment_198013" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-20T08:04:36+00:00" title="March 20, 2009  8:04AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Mark,<br/><br/>It's a good point you make, and my experience is similar.<br/><br/>That said, why does the freaking player get sidelined?  In part, because everyone else is getting on with the plot.<br/><br/>Assuming the freaking PC is not the result of a player who just wants to be the centre of attention, ie assuming functional play, what's happened within the game fiction?  Something terrible, and some are struggling to cope.<br/><br/>That's interesting, if it's not player grandstanding that's realistic (and realism, verismilitude if you prefer, matters to me at any rate).  It's dramatic too.<br/><br/>Everyone efficiently getting on with the monster before them, that's unrealistic, it's I think undramatic and worst of all it's uninteresting.<br/><br/>So, as you say, "How do you meaningfully engage with that sort of thing without it killing the momentum of the group's play dead?"

As Jason says, they're there at the table to DO something... whatever the perceived franchise for the game is. If you know from the outset, and have group buy in to, the idea that the Thing is "explore the trauma and disruption that intrusions from the horrific create in the everyday lives of ordinary people"... great. But usually people aren't bought into that - or have very divergent ideas of what that means. Whereas we've all seen the movie where the monster comes along, and yeah, somebody freaks out - but either they de-freak pretty quick, or they are Designated Victim and not a protagonist.<br/><br/>Our models for what to do in a game are usually built around narrative, not naturalism. Step A in getting away from that is to be sure everybody <b>wants</b> naturalism. Step B (the harder one) is figuring what the heck naturalism looks like. Normative statements are nobody's friend.<br/><br/>Also, What Jason Said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
