It's... pretty crazy, so I can't easily summarize all of the happenings, so instead I present to you the blog we use for organizational purposes and logs...</p>\n<p><a href="http://apocalypsetear.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://apocalypsetear.wordpress.com/</a></p>\n<p>...as well as provide some scattershot commentary on my general impressions.</p>\n<p>1) AW spreads like wildfire. The game started as me talking to a friend about a session I played. Then I got two players - a Battlebabe and a Driver who are sisters, and then next thing I know, we have 7 players total. Crazy.</p>\n<p>2) "You arrive into a city you don't really know, trouble hot on your tail, roll to read the sitch" works awesome as a kick-start of a game.</p>\n<p>3) The game emerges from little details and things players do SO EASY. A random scavenger a character encounter in the first session has achieved memetic badass status, and I had to do nothing but react to my players' lousy rolls. Also, barfing forth random apocalyptica didn't feel quite right when I did it, but later on, I take those little details, and build threats around them, and make recurring, and then everything is awesome again.</p>\n<p>4) That many players are difficult to manage, so we do scenes with the characters who are there for them, and instead have real-life weeks as "sessions."</p>\n<p>5) ARRG Hx. With 7-players, adjusting Hx and then teasing out highlights from players (there is almost always more than one person with highest Hx with someone) is basically an irritating chore. Hx gets most of its mileage out of the starting questions, since those develop some kind of ties between the characters... With time passing * more players added, it becomes less and less relevant.</p>\n<p>6) Players will surprise you. "Hey Brainer? Mind telling me the hidden fears and secrets of the reclusive metal-eating subway god?" "Sure!"</p>\n<p>7) You will surprise yourself. You will make a creepy but mostly harmless bartender, and the next thing you know he's messing with the savvyhead's exploded brain and hauling him off to a slaver for sale, stealing organs from battleabes, and collecting strange skulls.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_250974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DWeird" title="DWeird"><img alt="DWeird" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DWeird">DWeird</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/250974/#Comment_250974" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-15T05:39:54+00:00" title="January 15, 2010  5:39AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Loving the discussion here!<br/><br/>Anyway. One thing that should have been obvious, but isn't:<br/><br/>With so many people playing and with AW's use-a-move-and-get-improvement way of advancement, people may rocket forward through to 6 advancements only through fairly innocent scenes through which the main big bads would not have yet shown themselves. I don't really have enough time to do exposition 'cause, well, everyone is doing their own thing.<br/><br/>Now, I know I'm supposed to go with the flow and build the fronts around stuff the PCs encounter... But I did that, actually, but that was when there were far less players than there are now. Large numbers of people who join in one-by-one = somewhat of an issue for Apocalypse World MC'ing.<br/><br/>Looking back, I shouldn't have worked on making front clocks so much as going the other, more usual sandboxy game way - get a firm grasp not of the timeline, but of the *geography* of the city, and associate specific threats with specific places and have the PCs wander about.<br/><br/>I guess I might still do that, now... Might be even more fun, now that everything in Tear is swiftly going to hell without any real push from my side. Go "The Vegaless gang rampages here, with frequent excursions to here here and here. The range of Puppy-eyes' sniper skyscraper is, oh, about half this map. The burned-up marketplace that you guys aren't welcome in anymore... here. The blood-crying Truth and its followers are here, if they haven't been mowed down by one of the riled-up smaller gangs in Tear yet. If you don't want to be seen, well! Guess you'll just have to take the subway with Transit and her puppet brainer specter, yeah?"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_251003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/251003/#Comment_251003" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-15T09:14:40+00:00" title="January 15, 2010  9:14AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your Apocalypse World has a frickin <i>subway</i>?

Going into a new city, trouble hot on their tails was regular, habitual, background stuff for them. I meant that bit more in the way that the read a sitch questions - who's in control here? What enemy is weakest? What's my best escape route?, when asked about the city as a whole, really got me the proper kick needed to flesh it out further. I got: Puppy-eyes skyscraper sniper nest for control; dirty scavengers for the weakest enemy; weird subway system for escape route.

It's an extension of developing all your stats and looks and moves and gear. You do all that, and then you say, "so what about the fiction is a part of your character?" It's a way to settle into the characters and develop them in the fiction. In fact, when I finally get my AW game off the ground, I'll probably tell the players that the whole first session is going to be "character creation" and then launch into the first session stuff as soon as we finish up the hard-coded bits. <br/>\n<br/>\nThen, you take those bits and "first session" stuff and start playing the game, which could be the end of the first session or the beginning with the second session. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnyways, I haven't played yet, but that's how I'm envisioning it from the text.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
