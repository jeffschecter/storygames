If you choose to limit some of the species you could take things out. If you take out the Cybes (or use them as a template for the Borg), you could probably de-emphasise the cyberneticky stuff for PCs. Star Trek aliens should also be quite doable, as for the most part they are human analogues with minor differences. You can just make them up to taste IMO, whereas the included species actually have some quite different aspects.

I can give some feedback, particularly if there are any specific questions.</p>\n<p>Apologies for the necro. I opened this thread before I left on a cruise, and realized I wanted to leave something. I still have a chunk of comments in a draft but figured I wouldn't inundate unless people had more specific questions.</p>\n<p>Basically this is the GUMSHOE system, but I hadn't played any other games with it so I can't speak to its peculiar reshaping to fit. The system basically uses character traits as narrative currency though - "strong" traits, or "investigative" skills, automatically get you past an appropriate obstacle, and then are exhausted for the story session. "Weak" traits require a roll.</p>\n<p>The setting is malleable, but includes a bunch of set-pieces (specifically, that it's happening in the shadow of a status-quo-shattering space war, analogous to World War I, and that certain species and technology levels exist). I played Mass Effect on the Xbox 360 shortly after finishing my stint in playtest, and found that it rang very true to the tone, though it was closer to Mass Effect 2 insofar as it felt a bit more noirish, grimy, and as mentioned, "Stuff Has Gone Down" prior to the game. The "Spectre/Laser" analogy feels pretty good.</p>\n<p>Our party crewed a single ship, and did a lot of in-game computer research where possible. "Facts" coined by players in-game would stick; Chris Huth (who also did a lot of the game's art) asked, at one point, if we could look up a suspect's personal information on some kind of network. Robin asked what he meant, Chris replied "I dunno, Spacebook." From that point forward we looked stuff up on Spacebook.</p>\n<p>Individual weapon shots tended to be deadly. We'd often incapacitate or kill suspects or antagonists if we weren't careful. I suspect this can be dialed up or down, but any weapon in the Weapons List - particularly a Laser's default firearm - tends to take people out unless you specify stun ammo. The converse was also true, and survival-oriented biomods, either cybernetic or viral, quickly became de-rigeur.</p>\n<p>Idiosyncrasies in the the inter-species dynamics and Robin's GM tone made the thing feel pretty laid-back and sometimes even comedic, for a space opera. Adventures vary, I'm sure, but it had more of a caseworker/beat cop feel than Mass Effect did. Closer to CSI than 24. But the serious lethality of the system made it feel even more like Dashiell Hammett, which I appreciated, having been neck deep in that stuff when we played.</p>\n<p>I am happy to say as much more about sessions as people are interested in hearing.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331739">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331739/#Comment_331739" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-26T15:55:31+00:00" title="June 26, 2011  3:55PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 26, 2011 5:00PM by Peter_Aronson.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite><br/>Setting: Cthulhu in spaaace?
