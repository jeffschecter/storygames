It lets you assign importance to any given conflict -- lets you say, <em>this</em> conflict is important to me, moreso than others.  I also dig the <em>game</em> part of this mechanic; is this conflict so important that you want to risk dice on it, given that, if you fail, those dice will be unavailable to you for future conflicts?  This kind of thing is awesome, and it's not there in the perennial favorite, D&amp;D.</p>\n<p>So, here's the crazy idea:</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p><strong>Hero Points</strong></p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>Each player begins with a certain number (what number is good?) of Hero Points (let's call this number <em>n</em>).  During play, before a player rolls any die, Hero Points can be wagered on the roll.  Each Hero Point gambled adds +1 to the player's roll.  If the roll succeeds, the player keeps all the Hero Points he gambled, and gets one (or more?) new one.  If the roll fails, the player loses all gambled Hero Points.  (Maybe the DM adds a complication, too?)</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>At the end of each session, Hero Points can be spent to upgrade each player's character.  Some areas of upgrade will cost more than others.  Skill ranks might be bought at a cost of 1:1; base attack bonus upgrades should be more expensive, as should feats and ability score upgrades.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>&gt;</p>\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">\n<p>At the beginning of each new session, players with fewer than <em>n</em> Hero Points reset their Hero Point total to <em>n</em>.</p>\n</div></blockquote>\n<p>What do you guys think?

I'm still wary, thouigh.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think for most D&amp;D style dice systems, a "points refresh every now and then" approach is the simplest and safest.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122038">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson" title="Peter_Aronson"><img alt="Peter_Aronson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/744/nB35LGFW4NG1Z.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Peter_Aronson">Peter_Aronson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122038/#Comment_122038" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T10:20:42+00:00" title="January 26, 2008 10:20AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            With the gambling mechanism this is interesting.  Games without that have tied advancement to left-over conviction/hero/action/drama points generally just result in people hording the points and not using them.  On the other hand, the lure of advancement might be so strong that, instead of using them on rolls that matter, they'd instead be used solely on roles that are sure to be won.  I think you would need to do something to make risk more attractive.  One thought is to make the yield determined by how much of a difference the points make or how difficult the roll was to encourage serious gambling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122044">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21" title="Sean ov Newcastle !"><img alt="Sean ov Newcastle !" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sean%20ov%20Newcastle%20%21">Sean ov Newcastle !</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122044/#Comment_122044" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T10:42:34+00:00" title="January 26, 2008 10:42AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 26, 2008 10:46AM by Sean ov Newcastle !.">edited January 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played through a couple of short D&amp;D modules using Mark Whithers' anti-pool variant. When you succeed you lose your risked dice and when you're out of them you have to rely on your traits (e.g talented swordsman) for an extra die to help you succeed - it's like D&amp;Ds niche protection - ultimately you'll end up relying on what you're good at. So you need to gamble on whether it's worth using up your risk dice throughout the adventure or acting to your traits and saving the dice for the big finale. Dice are refreshed at the end of the session or scenario - whichever you prefer.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_122096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen" title="M Eryesen"><img alt="M Eryesen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/M%20Eryesen">M Eryesen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122096/#Comment_122096" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T18:36:08+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  6:36PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You aren't actually risking much with these hero points though.  So what if you blow all <i>n</i> early in the session?  Or never risk them at all?  You still have all your front loaded mechanical ability to resolve tasks.  Still have stacking feats, spells, skills, attack bonus, etc.,.  It's a cool idea, but I think there's just too much other mechanics present to make gambling a few +1s really matter.  The smart players who are looking to kick butt are going to gamble when they know they can win, get the +1 Hero Point, wash, rinse, repeat.  Then at the end of the session, they'll upgrade their characters and prepare to do it all over again, this time backed up by stronger regular in-game stats.<br/><br/>I think this idea might work in a more rules light edition of D&amp;D.  Like Basic D&amp;D, maybe 1ed AD&amp;D, BFRPG, Labyrinth Lord, etc., where there's not so much other mechanics to rely upon for every conceivable task that needs resolution.  Even then, I'd want to put in some sort of friction where the more they use the points, the more the GM gets villain points or something.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_122111">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/122111/#Comment_122111" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-26T20:50:38+00:00" title="January 26, 2008  8:50PM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey look... a thing!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.staunwark.com/pdfs/RaisingtheStakes.pdf" rel="nofollow">Raising the Stakes (pdf)</a><br/><br/>It's at least relevant to the discussion.

However, the point is that in D&amp;D there is already a difficulty level set for the task, before any Pool dice are spent.
