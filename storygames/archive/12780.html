I gave examples with several games I like, and how they could all do the same setting with each a different feel.<br/><br/>It was fun. I got to imagine playing Mouse Guard with the rules for PTA, Capes, InSpectres... All neat stuff. Stretching my imagination.<br/><br/>Then I got to 1001 Nights, and I though what I came up with was cool enough to share it here.<br/><br/>We play it instead of, or in addition too, the normal Winter Session for Mouse Guard, within a regular MG campaign using regular MG rules.<br/><br/>Our mice are stuck in Lockhaven for winter. Or I guess it could be another city, it doesn't matter. <br/><br/>They've got time to kill, so they tell stories. That plays pretty much like the regular game. This could really flesh out the setting, as they tell tales of legendary heroes of yore, or the characters themselves, if they tell stories from before the campaign begined.<br/><br/>Players still have ambitions to fulfill, that doesn't change. <br/><br/>They aren't gonna get beheaded, by Gwendolyn or anybody, that's stupid. If they fail safety, they just narrate bad stuff that happens to them. If they fail thrice, they gain a new appropriate condition, and it sticks. (They could make their next ambition about removing that condition, though).<br/><br/>Freedom is just a pacing mechanic. We make a common pool of it. I'm not sure how many successes would be needed. I suppose, 5-7 per player in the game. But these stay between sessions. When we reach the target number, winter is over, and we return to regular Mouse Guard play.<br/><br/>Ambitions gained are adapted into the character sheets. Like a new relationship, a new trait, or better skills. So are conditions, as I said earlier.<br/><br/>Whaddayathink?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287500/#Comment_287500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T09:24:55+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  9:24AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I, for one, like the sound of it.  I could also see this method used to make a preamble to the game, wherein you keep Lockhaven but use 1001 Nights to flesh out the rest of the setting/history before the game.  I could also see it being used to describe what happened to the mice over the winter (though that would be more limiting, it would help flesh out relationships and NPCs around Lockhaven).  <br/><br/>I've really enjoyed all the discussion of late about games continuity spanning different rules sets.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287503">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287503/#Comment_287503" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T09:37:38+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  9:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome!<br/><br/>Personally, I still want to try Mousespent Youth.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
