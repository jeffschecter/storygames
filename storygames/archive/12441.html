The premise of the game is very simple: the undead have arisen to feast upon the living and the players are a team of mercenaries hired to cleanse a site of the infection.<br/><br/>Each game starts by rolling 101d6, to represent the horde of zombies at the site, which is chosen by the players; the first session took place in a stadium used for sporting events and rock concerts, whilst the second used the Science Museum in London. Characters are simple sketches, mostly defined by their Strength, Speed and Smarts. The bulk of the game consists of picking up a number of zombie dice whose sum is equal to or less than one of these stats and rolling them to see how many of them you kill and whether you get injured doing so. There are also some tactical options like shoring up the barricades, looking for weapons and healing any of the characters, with the aim being to kill all the zombies before they overwhelm the barricades and swarm the site.<br/><br/>The first time we played, we had a TPK, but the rules got a good going over and were mostly pretty tight, with the feedback largely being about the confusing tactical option of using Smarts instead of Strength or Speed to do some things. It also turned out, on closer examination, that using that option allowed you to kiil as many zombies as using Strength or Speed but with the bonus of gaining resource points or barricades as well.<br/><br/>The main reason I'm writing this report though is to shine a spotlight on Sam, who went above and beyond by designing, printing, laminating and then cutting out with scissors a vast array of tokesn to represent all the variables in the game such as damage, gear and so on. These were a beautiful set of photos of guns, chainsaws, bullets, first aid kits and blood splatters, with '101 Zombies!' written on the back. We played the second game with these tokens tonight, as well as some more players, going from 4 up to 6 and this time we won!<br/><br/>So a big shout out to Sam for his support; his enthusiasm will keep me working on the rough edges of this game and he has eraned a special mention if I ever manage to go to publication with it. Thanks again Sam!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
