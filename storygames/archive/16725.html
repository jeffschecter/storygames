Then, around the 39 minute mark, we talk edutainment; what works, what doesn't, and what the heck edutainment actually means. As always, feedback is welcomed and if you have a game you would like playtested, email to momsbasement@miserytourism.com . We prefer games in playtesting and games that are in a playable condition. See ya next week.<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/2012/06/episode-45-magicians-edutainment.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://momsbasementpodcast.blogspot.com/2012/06/episode-45-magicians-edutainment.html</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kksimons" title="kksimons"><img alt="kksimons" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/199/n1OTAOAPJXCFP.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kksimons">kksimons</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382410/#Comment_382410" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T04:54:57+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  4:54AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys! So first all of: you're all awesome. And after listening to your AP I can see you're all really awesome role-players and it was really great to be listen to both the podcast and the AP report. <br/><br/>I'm really glad you guys got what I was trying to do with it - making magic interesting, foreign and "magical" in its own right. Like you said, the best way to play would be if someone in the group was fluent but in terms of checking pronunciation I had it set up to use a smart phone (iOS or Android + Dragon Dictation app) which you'd speak into and it would write down what it heard. So you'd get some feedback in terms of what it writes down (what it heard vs. what you were trying to say) and it also is an impartial arbiter. That way you'd know for sure if you succeeded or not, which words weren't clear, etc.<br/><br/>Learning a new language in the beginning can be frustrating I think too because, like you were saying Alex, it just sounds like a bunch of sounds and is completely foreign. While the alphabet is completely phonetic and easy to learn, the vocabulary is not - you basically have to memorize and equate the sound to the meaning of the word or have an extensive knowledge of Chinese writing and how it is used in Korean (and even that would probably only get you half the vocab - it'd be like us learning French). In the videos when I wrote down \uc758\uc0ac and said it was doctor, I could have broken it down and said well \uc758 comes from the Chinese character that means having to do with medicine and \uc0ac comes from the formal Chinese word meaning person or profession but, even more so than in Korean than Chinese, the same characters and sounds will have various meanings depending on the character that follows, etc. Essentially, for western learners vocab simply has to be memorized, there isn't really a way to make up words without having a really vast understanding of the language.<br/><br/>The list of words I gave in the book is pretty small because what I normally had people playing the game do was use a Korean-English dictionary (usually on their smartphone or online) to search for the noun and verb they wanted. Then they could speak in into the dragon dictation app and see if they cast it specifically. If you look on the cheat sheet there, there's a link to an online dictionary - that's my bad though, clarity is something I've been having to focus on as I've been refining. The process of casting spells usually goes like this 1) figure out what verb and noun fits the context of what I want to do 2) find those words in the dictionary 3) write them down, open up dragon dictation and speak into it 4) see if I was successful or not, what happens, etc.<br/><br/>So anyway, sorry about that Alex, I'd really like to thank you all for doing this I can see how it must have been frustrating trying to come up with spells but being limited by not knowing any Korean. I'm definitely going to add an easier system to be a stepping stone for more of a pick-up-and-play style that people might even be able to do at a con or something without having to spend some time learning the language. Still, I'm glad you guys had fun playing it, it was really great to listen to and you can bet it helped me out a lot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382455">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whduryea" title="whduryea"><img alt="whduryea" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v220/Nugan/noose755.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whduryea">whduryea</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382455/#Comment_382455" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T14:23:39+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  2:23PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks Kyle!<br/><br/>I had a lot of fun playing, and I'm glad the feedback was useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382463/#Comment_382463" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-15T14:41:27+00:00" title="June 15, 2012  2:41PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 15, 2012 2:45PM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your critiques are interesting, but is there a way you could record some of your playtests?
