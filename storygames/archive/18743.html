I am a big fan of card-based resolution mechanics, so I'd been looking forward to trying this one for a while. I'm wondering, though, whether I ran it as well as I could've, so I figured I'd ask what kind of experience others have had running it.<br/><br/>We played through a retelling of <i>Rio Bravo,</i> a story of how a sheriff (John Wayne), his drunkard of a deputy (Dean Martin), and other misfits guard a murderer while his brother's goons try to bust him out. Some aspects of the rules worked like a charm: In true Western-movie fashion, the bonus/penalty associated with the Devil could really go either way for any given character, and so it did for us. The "Selfish" Gambler learned to work on a team; and while the "Drunkard" Deputy could've gone the Dean Martin route and struggled against his drinking to save everyone, instead, he drank constantly and used his Devil to save everyone in the final scene, so numb to pain that he stood in a hail of bullets, throwing dynamite at their enemies. <br/><br/>We had a pretty hard time with the card mechanic, though, which felt way too fiddly and time-consuming, especially in scenes with multiple NPCs. The rules specify that the Dealer (GM) might have to hold separate hands and manage chip expenditure for NPCs, but in scenes with the NPC sheriff and an NPC criminal, that quickly proved way too burdensome to deal with. The players just sat there while I sifted through multiple hands, trying to juggle chips for each. I started just doing stud hands after that (which don't involve chip expenditure or directly consider how much harm enemies have already taken), and it did speed things up, but it meant that the NPCs almost certainly drew crappy hands. The players expressed concerns afterward that things felt slow even on their own end, especially with chips adding what they considered an unnecessary layer of complexity, and wondered whether some conflicts made more sense to play hands for than others. (They liked it in a classic standoff scene with multiple armed people; they didn't see the need for it in a scene where the murderer tried to push his way past them and his crony tried to create an opening for him, because it had "fewer moving parts.") I wonder, too, whether they'd have found it easier if we just played more poker.<br/><br/>If you've played or run Dust Devils, does any of this sound familiar to you? Does it sound like we missed the point of certain things or did things wrong? I like the premise of the system a lot, and I love the way the character creation process encourages certain kind of stories to be told, so I'm hoping we can get past these kind of issues to play it again (or to play its spy/urban crime variants, which also look neat).                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_420619">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420619/#Comment_420619" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T11:56:21+00:00" title="August 23, 2013 11:56AM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've played the game a lot, especially in 2004-05; it's one of my all-time favourites for its combination of lethality and pacing. Your observations don't sound too far-fetched, I could see that as a legitimate critique. The handling time isn't any worse than many rpgs, but it may be more than some. It helps a lot if the Dealer is facile with cutting to the core of a scene, laying out the real conflict situation; DD is classic Forge stakes-setting in that making it go relies on your ability to recognize the conflict more than anything else. If you make the mistake of establishing a weak conflict (that is, using the conflict mechanics for trivial things), or miscommunicate the real meat of the scene (ending up ignoring the actually interesting conflict), I could see the conflict system growing annoying. It's definitely not a system you should throw down for every time somebody's climbing over a wall - err on the side of big scope with a system like this, rather: as soon as you realize that two characters have a conflict of interest, no matter whether the characters even know it themselves yet, start dealing cards already. Lavish choreographic color on the scene by all means, but before and after the cards, but don't let the scope of a conflict drill down into small fictive details; you're not resolving whether a character succeeds in jumping on his horse, but rather whether he'll succeed in escaping the scene, any which way, as determined by the narrator after the cards are down.<br/><br/>Also, you should definitely be facile in shuffling, dealing and handling the cards. As you say, the systemic overhead grows significantly if the players are clumsy with cards. Regarding the chips - I've mostly played the first edition, but I don't remember that this would have changed in the revised - I would encourage you to largely ignore them at first, and only introduce their use over the first session of play, as the players grow competent with the other parts of the system. The chips have one truly core utility (folding costs chips, and is crucial to skilled play), but aside from that almost everything else can be introduced as it seems interesting. DD is a bit of a tactical game (not that you're trying to win, but that you can do neat narrative tricks if you know how), but you can definitely play successfully with minimal engagement on the finer tactical points.<br/><br/>For handling NPCs, you should just make it quick by being facile yourself with the cards: draw X cards, check them, pick the hand, decide to fold or not, move on to the next NPC. For the love of Snyder don't get stuck mulling over the cards, that's a player prerogative - it's not the end of the world if you miss the occasional card combination. Practice this alone, perhaps? You should get that down to like ten seconds per NPC, much quicker than the players. And of course the game involves mostly PC vs. PC conflicts, and you don't use NPC hands for unimportant NPCs, and so on - it should be rare for multiple important NPCs to be in a single conflict. If there's a NPC in a conflict, and they're just backing up some more primary actor (two NPCs say, and one is helping the other achieve their goals), don't draw a hand for them; instead, let the primary actor look at their hand and decide whether they need help, and if they do, the supporting party may spend chips or whatever on their behalf. (I'm a bit vague on this last point because I haven't played for a few years - I had an established way I played this detail, cribbed from TSoY, can't just remember it right now.)<br/><br/>Even with all of the above, you should maybe recalibrate your expectations: DD is not a storytelling game where you chat along and then take out the cards half-way into the session; it's a constant move from conflict to conflict, every scene has a deal, you're constantly dealing cards. (Aggressive scene-framing does this: your every scene has a conflict, practically, so the only way for the players to avoid one is to back down early, or for the Dealer to miss with his pitch occasionally. There's a rhythm to the game, dealing cards and all, when this is done correctly.) You should expect to be talking and dealing at the same time, going fluidly from one round of conflict to the next. It would be a problem if a group was, like, stopping their play to deal with the cards. Rather, you talk and manipulate the cards simultaneously, just like you'd do while playing Poker and chatting with the other players at the same time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_420623">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/420623/#Comment_420623" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-08-23T12:58:43+00:00" title="August 23, 2013 12:58PM">August 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the thoughtful feedback. I'm passing this link along to my players to see what they think. It sounds like we did a fine job keeping goals abstract enough in each conflict (not "I want to shoot the gun out of the bad guy's hand" but "I protect the sheriff"), but we really needed to simplify things to keep stuff moving, and I really needed to declare more situations as conflicts. We have a tendency to try to roleplay through social conflict and only use resolution mechanisms for scenes with possible physical exertion, which is a habit we need to break if we're going to try more story games.<br/><br/>Next time I run this (probably for a Casino Royale adaptation using Deathwish rules), I think I'll cut down on chip use (maybe just let players use them to fold), and try to keep all Dealer-side challenges as just one hand at a time. (And if any of my players are reading this, I welcome you to chime in and let me know what you'd rather do, too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
