We've been playing a lot of one-shots (mainly fiasco atm, some short apoc world) and right now i am really starting to yearn for some more old-school long-play games with a lot of exploration.<br/><br/>I know that i will not like the game mechanics of the the more trad-style games (D&amp;D, WoD, etc) and was thinking about some possible other rules-sets to use.<br/><br/>One thing which grabbed my attention was "Agon", very competitive between the players, but the mechanics seem pretty simple and straightforward as well. Could the Agon rules have the "gods and quests" part ripped out and make the game into a simpler sword&amp;sandals type game?<br/><br/>Or does anyone else have other ideas for running this style of game?<br/><br/>K                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315702">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315702/#Comment_315702" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T05:58:25+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  5:58AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My experiences:<br/><br/>I did this pretty successfully with 3.5e (E6 version)<br/><br/>I burned out fast and hard trying to do this with 4e.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315706">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315706/#Comment_315706" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T06:38:59+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  6:38AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After playing AW, you don't think it is suited for this kind of thing?

Next game player of B is busy and cant make it, so A and C join up with D to do something else. <br/><br/>Apoc World worked best for us when the characters were bound to each other (via their hx). We tried playing a hack of apoc world (saga of the icelanders) where Hx was conspicuously absent. While the game was still fun it floundered heavily at times.<br/><br/>Might have to think a little on this.  Our group enjoyed apoc world, just that the set moves felt a little.. constricting? Not sure that is the right word. Having the moves on the character sheet made a very fast pickup and play game, but they funnel the game in a particular way that felt strange/uncomfortable at times coming from a more open use of skills in other games (especially WoD)<br/><br/>But, they do push the game in a very particular direction.. hmm. Yes, some thought on this will be required.<br/><br/>"Fair rewards, scarcity, bragging rights" is the direction the game should be pushing. The players should be able to be saying "There is an evil goblin tower over the mountains, we totally should get Rob, Andy and Marie for next session. But Pete and George want to go there next week? Then lets beat them there for the loot!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315710">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315710/#Comment_315710" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T07:02:39+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  7:02AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dionysus</cite>I know that i will not like the game mechanics of the the more trad-style games (D&amp;D, WoD, etc) and was thinking about some possible other rules-sets to use.</blockquote>\nSo what do you not like about these, so that I don't suggest something that still has the thing you don't like in them?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315712">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff" title="Michael Pfaff"><img alt="Michael Pfaff" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Michael%20Pfaff">Michael Pfaff</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315712/#Comment_315712" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T07:11:19+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  7:11AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will put another vote in (with Ry) <i>against</i> 4E D&amp;D.

As I <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.canonpuncture.com/?p=1645" rel="nofollow">advocate</a> <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_271/8108-Imagine-Your-Perfect-Arcade-Game" rel="nofollow">elsewhere</a>, old-school D&amp;D; is a different beast. I like the 1974 original rules, but you could also do well with the Moldvay Red Box Basic D&amp;D.; (Swords &amp; Wizardry Whitebox, Labyrinth Lord, etc. reproduce the rules of these but maybe not the random tables you want; if you go with those also download the OSRIC rules and Kellri's Old-School Encounters netbook to be sure you have enough random-table goodness).<br/>\n<br/>\nIn my experience with New York Red Box's West Marches campaigns, the thing you want is a game where:<br/>\na) there is a lot of scope for random events<br/>\nb) the assumptions about the world are already baked into the random event tables<br/>\n<br/>\nD&amp;D; 4E fails on both counts - the encounter design etc. enforces predictability and doesn't give you any tools for randomness, which means you're forever having to think about level-appropriate encounters. With OD&amp;D; or Moldvay, you can basically just set players loose and see what happens, because the tables are designed to support this kind of play; you don't need carefully balanced parties, a cohesive storyline, etc. because the game approach encourages exploration and discovery for the referee ("<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://muleabides.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/illusionism-and-wandering-monsters/" rel="nofollow">wow, what does it mean that there are balrogs as wandering monsters?</a>") as well as the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315719/#Comment_315719" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T07:39:38+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  7:39AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "not like" part of the mechanics - mainly combat is too nasty/time intensive.<br><br>i LIKE how many of the smaller one shots that i've been playing allow for whole slew of activities to be dealt with in one (or a few) rolls.<br><br>the focus should be on the exploration, and creative ways to get around/through problems.

That game actually makes a lot more sense in the earlier versions (for instance, when all characters have 1d6 hit points and all weapons deal 1d6 damage, it's crystal-clear that "hit points" are not trying to simulate any kind of reality other than the unexpected deadliness of fighting a <i>monster</i> in the dark).<br/><br/>Other interesting options definitely exist.

One thing that (I think) is essential to a West Marches-style game is micro increments, both in rewards and in penalties. That suits exploration well: you get tired or roughed up from scaling cliffs or forced marching all night, or you get a little profit from discovering a hidden cache.<br/><br/>Ability score damage in D&amp;D 3e was a _godsend_ for making West Marches work. PCs were frequently down a point or two of Wis from marsh fever, or Strength from spider venom, or whatever. It added a whole additional axis of attrition other than just hit points.<br/><br/>Games without micro increments basically fail -- you're just wandering around waiting for big fights/conflicts, and all the minute-by-minute exploration becomes mechanically meaningless.<br/><br/>And that's where Agon could be a very nice fit. You take attrition when you impair abilities in conflicts, and every single thing in the game is linked to accumulating Glory, so reward is already built in. I can see the conflict to decide which hero discovers the hidden treasure, to march through the swamp, etc. It totally works.<br/><br/>The main thing that would need rejiggering is the Antagonist's strife pool -- the whole concept of the Antagonist being limited to certain resources on a given adventure. The wilds never run out of threat. Instead you want danger to be based on where the PCs go. I could see changing the spending limits to be based on the danger of the zone (Encounter Level in D&amp;D 3e terms) rather than PC name. Interludes could give the Antagonist strife above and beyond that, so that it would still have some teeth.<br/><br/>I'm liking the idea...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Akchizar" title="Akchizar"><img alt="Akchizar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/407/nK0KWE2DNMA2X.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Akchizar">Akchizar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315816/#Comment_315816" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-07T20:48:04+00:00" title="March  7, 2011  8:48PM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I've been kinda itching to run something similar for a while now.

Lamentations of the Flame Princess is just my favorite interpretation of OD&amp;D to come out of the OSR. In general, every retroclone to come out of the OSR movement is top-shelf material, tweaked to a variety of preferences. Then there's OSRIC, which has every freakin' option AD&amp;D ever had (I think, I've only read about it). Then there's Moldvay, my favorite classic edition of OD&amp;D, but I can't find it anywhere and I hate eBay.<br/><br/>But seriously, if you think Apoc World has what you want for a West-Marches style game (and I totally agree), go look up Dungeon World Hack right now. Maybe send Sage an email asking if he'll hook you up with a few of the chapters that are still in development, or play a short session of DW and post about how it worked for you (that will get you into the Adventurer's Guild which will get you iterative access to the full Dungeon World "beta" pdf as it's revised).<br/><br/>Bonds (Hx), Fronts, and the general design of AW would be RAD for West Marches.<br/><br/>I hope I've conveyed my frenetic excitement for a West Marches Dungeon World game properly.

A lot of the "core" crunch seems to be in the area of experience and skill levelling. It seems to me that this sort of complexity could be very interesting in a WM-style game, where people are looking for challenges in order to extend themselves and potentially gain/improve skills.<br/><br/>I think a lot of the mood of Mouse Guard could also be applied to a WM-style game. A lot of the flavour in that seemed to focus on "The world is dangerous and the wilderness has plenty of threats (both sentient and non-) that can seriously hurt you", which I think would be important to this sort of game.<br/><br/>Haven't got around to playing either of these, though, so it's more a case of "Would this be any good?" rather than "You should try this".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_316105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/316105/#Comment_316105" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-10T00:29:13+00:00" title="March 10, 2011 12:29AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okiedokies.

(teamwork or individual, either is good).<br/> - non reliance on set "party" (ie, group composition can change, and does regularly).<br/> - safe haven vs wilds.<br/> - exploration: finding out what is out there, putting it on a map for others to challenge later.<br/><br/>The exploration is REALLY hard to do. Well, really hard for a GM to pre-plan all the maps/encounters etc. And the players should _want_ to find the most dangerous places so they can get the biggest rewards (XP/gold/bragging rights etc) So the key to this is generating the challenge and places...<br/><br/>Reading through the microscope rules gave me an idea - instead of exploring the history of a world, I want to be exploring the geography of a world...<br/><br/>Lets say, players start off in their safe place - the West-March Fort. They then create Journeys (akin to the microscope Periods). This would be a particular challenge of wilderness travel. The Journeys lead to Lands (akin to Events) which are certain terrain types (like say, the Forest of Mirkwood, or the Plains of Rohan etc). Inside each Land there can be a great many Locations (like, the tower of Dol Guldur, or the Ruined fortress of Helms Deep, or a Dragon's lair). <br/><br/>This then will make your map.<br/><br/>The players can then form a quest to get to a location and gain glory - they have to travel over the journeys to get to their desired location.<br/><br/>When the players get to a Location, we then jump into the base rules (of, eg, Agon), where the character are determining the particular challenges that they encounter. I like Agon for this because of the strife/Glory rules. The more strife spent, the more challenging the encounter, and the more glory/XP you get for overcoming it. If you make the challenge lethal, then you bump up the glory again. Its gambling, raising stakes etc. Which is always fun in and of itself.<br/><br/>The next problem is how to determine this strife pool? <br/>(A fun thought would be making the determination a literal gambling between the players - they bid into a pool of strife, and when the player who bids the most gets bonus glory if they can beat the challenge. )<br/>The strife determines the default opposition - how difficult is the raging river going to be to cross, exactly how "unscalable" are the cliffs of despair? How mean is the dragon lying in wait?<br/><br/>K                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
