Character creation had gone well and is posted as a separate <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KNGWM_eeTYpyOT-7MVcaPumz10IobUQAgs8Bny7y3ng/edit?hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">Google Doc</a>. \xa0The chat log will be posted when I've \u201ccleaned it up\u201d ie fixed my horrendous spelling <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> \xa0We were also using Skype, so the rules discussions were often done there, I'll try and remember those and comment on them. \xa0Screenshots can be seen <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://picasaweb.google.com/101615573486204248039/DungeonWorldPlaytest" rel="nofollow">here</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nA brief summary of the events:<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>Fr Carmine and Tarim are talking in a bar, De'alist and Farleigh are both nearby. 4 thugs burst into the room looking for Fr Carmine and the lead Half Orc Thug attempts to take him hostage. A fight ensues whereby the Player Characters kill 3 of the Thugs and take one captive. \xa0A piece of leather is found in a locket worn by the Half Orc and questioning of the captive and the dead reveal that the Thugs were hired by Scarface Orcs to capture the Priest.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe next day the Play Characters head North on the trail of the Scarface Orcs, however they come across a camp of Orcs where a fight between two Orcs seems to be taking place. \xa0After a brief scrap Fr Carmine manages to dupe the Orcs into believeing he is working under the Orcs Leader Reekum.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo be continued...</i><br/>\n<br/>\nI'm going to post without rereading the rules and had the following Dungeon World issues as a GM:<br/>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\nSometimes I wanted to modifier the rolls for difficulty, can I?</ul>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\nSometimes I wanted to see if things were noticed, but couldn't see how I could do this, ie have the player make a roll without them saying the fiction?</ul>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\nOften after one \u201cround of combat\u201d I wasn't sure \xa0how to move on to the next.</ul>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\nCan a aid / hinder roll be taken after the main roll?</ul>\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\nOf note I was often asked to draw a map (see post</ul>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15190&amp;page=1#Item_12" rel="nofollow">here</a>)\n<ul class="bbcode_list">\nI had ruled that back stabbing with a precise weapon was Roll+dex</ul>\n<br/>\nRuleset / Extension issues:<br/>\nOne player commented on having duplicate icon buttons on the right hand side, only one player had this (they were lite, everyone else was full), I had seen this a couple of times when using a second instances as unregistered, however it went away when I logged out and back in.<br/>\nEach time a player logged in the chat window was resized for one of the players<br/>\n<br/>\nRules:<br/>\nA Player commented on why carouse was Con and not Cha, didn't look like there was enough Cha moves.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'll pick out some of the <i>issues</i> here:<br/>\n<br/>\nAfter reading a lot of the posts on Story Games and Dungeon World forums I acted as follows during a combat:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe three \u201cHuman Thugs\u201d lunge with their knives at the people in the inn that had come to the defense of the Priest...<br/>\n<span style="color:red">Tarim moves to pin his knife hand and control his body.</span> - I took this as Hack and Slash, reacting to the move.<br/>\n<span style="color:red">De'alist Stands up from the table, moving rather smoothly as he waves his hand toward the thug that came near. "Vel'Ros'e'na" (Magic Missile)</span> \u2013 I took this as Defy Danger, then Cast a Spell.<br/>\n<span style="color:red">Fr. Carmine picks up his stool and swings it at the nearest thug's head</span> \u2013 I took this as accept the attack, then Hack and Slash (I wasn't comfortable with it and explained why \u2013 the fiction didn\u2019t mention the incoming attack \u2013 and as it was the first combat we went with it).<br/>\n<span style="color:red">Farleigh will dance lightly back into an open area, her rapier up and ready to parry and thrust</span> \u2013 As this was said after the other three and she was a thief \xa0I allowed it to be converted to a backstab against one of the \u201cHuman Thugs\u201d that were intent on the other PCs.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen Farleigh and De'alist infiltrated the camp I got into \u201cstandard RPG mode\u201d and wanted to give information for a successful Notice roll \u2013 there appeared to be two groups of Orcs. \xa0If they didn't say any fiction that sounded like they would notice this, then I couldn't. On retrospect one of the players should have acted out Discern Realities, but they didn't at that time.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn a Defy Danger roll of 7-9, can the \u201cworse outcome, hard bargain or ugly choice\u201d be ignored if the action that caused the Defy danger to be rolled is reconsidered?<br/>\n<br/>\nOn two occasions I broke the rule \u201cAlways Say \u2013 What The Rules Demand\u201d, however I felt it was justified and made sure that the Player new that I had done so, something of greater power caused the spell Speak with Dead to fail.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn" title="Murgh_Bpurn"><img alt="Murgh_Bpurn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn">Murgh_Bpurn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346201/#Comment_346201" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T03:51:42+00:00" title="October 16, 2011  3:51AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Chatlog can now be found <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sQERKsXVethflqalH7BYlvN3JkoESu_a64I0ZRTZ5JQ/edit?hl=en_US" rel="nofollow">here</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Felan" title="Felan"><img alt="Felan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Felan">Felan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346212/#Comment_346212" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T07:03:48+00:00" title="October 16, 2011  7:03AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Re: Spot/notice rolls - if you think the players should notice, just tell them what it is and play to see what happens. No need for a roll, treat it like Passive Perception in D&amp;D 4E. Otherwise, if it's something they shouldn't necessarily notice, or you'd rather let them discover for themselves, just don't say anything. If they discern realities, great, if not, move on and play to see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346227/#Comment_346227" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T11:42:08+00:00" title="October 16, 2011 11:42AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2011 11:44AM by skinnyghost.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On a Defy Danger roll of 7-9, can the \u201cworse outcome, hard bargain or ugly choice\u201d be ignored if the action that caused the Defy danger to be rolled is reconsidered?</blockquote>\nAll the "Defy Danger" roll does is trigger after the GM says something like "There is a Danger, what do you do?" and the player responds by ignoring or attempting to tough his or her way through that Danger.  So, if you defy Danger and are given a hard choice, the choice may be to not do what you'd intended to do in the first place.  Like so.<br><br>"There's a bunch of goblins on the hillside, they can see you running for the house.  An arrow lands in the tree nearby - you're a sitting duck out here.  What do you do?" "I want to run for the House and kick the door in." "Okay, well, that's definitely an attempt to Bend Bars, Lift Gates, but you need to dodge some arrows first.  Defy Danger for me, please." "Roll roll roll ... 7!"  "Okay, you can get to the door without getting arrowed, but you have to juke back and forth and, in doing so, your pack slips for your shoulder and you'll have to leave it behind.  Otherwise, you get to the door with an arrow stuck in you - alternately, you can just bail out halfway - no arrow, no lost pack but you're no closer to the door.  Which do you want?"  and if the player chooses the "fuck it, I don't run for it" option, then none of this stuff happens and the player doesn't get to make his attempt.<br><br>I don't know if that answers your question, exactly, but I'm sure other people will want to jump in and help clear things up, too.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_346228">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn" title="Murgh_Bpurn"><img alt="Murgh_Bpurn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Murgh_Bpurn">Murgh_Bpurn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346228/#Comment_346228" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-16T11:52:33+00:00" title="October 16, 2011 11:52AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2011 11:56AM by Murgh_Bpurn.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Which do you want?"  and if the player chooses the "fuck it, I don't run for it" option, then none of this stuff happens and the player doesn't get to make his attempt.</blockquote>\nAnswers it exactly and is just how I played it <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
