Said tales generally resulted in a combination of the following:<br/><br/>-\tLots of skill checks to find clues that may or may not be there, that may or may not have been useful<br/>-\tLimited opportunity to demonstrate character (ie, \u2018role-play\u2019) without derailing the flow of the game<br/>-\tA distinct lack of \u2018action\u2019 until the final confrontation, which often became an anticlimax<br/>-\tGames frequently over-running time slots<br/><br/>Seeking something positive from the discussion, talk turned to \u2018well how would you do it?\u2019 My solution would be to run a game like the Sherlock Holmes films, where each investigative thread inevitably leads to some sort of action as the mystery you pursue is also pursuing you. There was some discussion that I might then not be running an investigative scenario at all, just a pulpy action game with a trail of clues in its structure, and that\u2019s probably a fair cop.<br/><br/>So how would you do it? How do you run pacy, engaging investigative games which avoid (or minimise) the difficulties above? I\u2019m thinking specifically of one-shots or con games where you want a resolution in 3 or 4 hours.<br/><br/>Guy<br/><br/>EDIT: added a question mark to make it clear that I'm asking for advice rather than providing answers!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Krippler" title="Krippler"><img alt="Krippler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i20.photobucket.com/albums/b211/Plumbumdeath/mine.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Krippler">Krippler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372110/#Comment_372110" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T10:05:56+00:00" title="April 10, 2012 10:05AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2012 10:08AM by Krippler.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Having run the same investigation scenario for 15+ hours (different groups) at Gothcon recently I agree with all of those. What the scenario did well was:<br/><br/>- Fictional schedule. The characters had stuff to do other than investigating and some clues popped up with time if they didn't find them earlier. Halfway through the schedule is broken by a sandstorm and so they are completely free but by that time they should have ample leads (and truth be told we never made it as far as the sandstorm).<br/>- Not hiding clues. Most are in obvious but not open places, makes the players feel smart.<br/>- No red herrings, players are good at making those up for themselves.<br/>- Closed space.<br/>- Villain isolated and not physically imposing, the players could deal with her themselves when they figured her out.<br/>- Factions! If the characters need help from other factions they also need to investigare <i>their </i>goals before commiting.<br/>- Villain has some social safety, even when their gut feeling screams "she's the one!" first time they meet they can't touch her without evidence.<br/>- Clues tie back to the characters. In this case all of the characters were novice nuns investigating the "suicide" of their close friend which had had an affair with two of the player characters and a close friendship with the rest and called each of them "my little swallow". In her cell there is a figure of a swallow containing a hidden message and there was always one or several players who went *gasp* when they found it and then the rest would be "what do <i>you </i>mean by *gasp*?" and there'd be a small to medium interlude of characters reevaluating their emotions for the victim (but since they found the ritual books in the room they'd also be on to the bigger mystery by then so they'd keep going even if some characters would decide they hated her for playing them).<br/><br/>The time slot was about 1-1\xbd hours too small. I talked with the authors later and learned it wasn't playtested which probably is the key to everything including difficulty and pacing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372113/#Comment_372113" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T10:23:27+00:00" title="April 10, 2012 10:23AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This comes up seasonally. ;-)<br/><br/>I always point to this Forge thread:<br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13089.0" rel="nofollow">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/archive/index.php?topic=13089.0</a><br/><br/>Third post down.

It's not a trail of clues (although it looks like that to the players,) it's a network of clues.  It's too easy to set up an investigation where you need almost all of the clues (and possibly a dose of intuition) to "solve" it.  It should feel more like you always have a few clear leads to more places to look. <i>And the path you took to get to the solution was important.</i><br/><br/>My suggestions would be something like:<br/>-- Clues should always point fairly clearly towards new potential Scenes.<br/>-- Every Scene should have at least three potential Clues with a good/great chance of the PCs finding them (don't be stingy.)<br/>-- Every Scene should be interesting and challenging on its own.  Maybe there's an ambush, or you have to break in to get the clues, or you're trying to get information out of someone who's also getting information out of you, etc.  Just making Per rolls at a secure crime scene isn't very engaging.<br/>-- There should be a kind of progression of Scenes, with the Scenes leading directly to the climax/big reveal (probably) not directly pointed to by the starting Clues, and possibly one or more layers if indirection.<br/>-- Scenes* should give the characters some chance to prepare or alter the climax if they've "completed" the Scene.  Might just be that if you clear out the gang den first, you don't have to fight them with their boss later.  Or if you follow up on the mutilations and figure out there's a werewolf, you've got silver bullets handy for the big shootout.<br/>-- Scenes* should all have a "reveal" and change the climax in some way if the characters don't "complete" the Scene.  If you don't find that there's a traitor in your organization working with the baddy, your calls for backup will fail.  If you don't find the gang den, the villain will reveal them at the climax.  etc.<br/>* - these might not apply to all scenes, it's fine if the first "layer" doesn't have a big effect.  But if there are three scenes with Clues that point to the climax, they should probably each have a payoff if completed and a reveal if bypassed.<br/><br/>Ideally, the players end up thinking "I don't know what we would have done at the end if we hadn't brought those silver bullets" without realizing that the implicit tradeoff was "we would have found the gang and just had to deal with the werewolf alone."<br/><br/>The goal here is to make sure that the players are making choices, that those choices have a clear effect on the game.  If the players methodically skirt around the climax and close off all the payoffs/reveals before the confrontation, it's probably OK to have it be relatively anticlimatic, since the PCs have already run through a few more scenes than you expected them too.  Depending on the system, the challenges from those extra scenes might have depleted them enough to have just about the same challenge level regardless.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372145">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372145/#Comment_372145" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T11:55:28+00:00" title="April 10, 2012 11:55AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, what cy said.

It was about a Cthulhu-esque cult in post-hippie 1977 Los Angeles, with strong satirical touches. Completely freeform.<br/><br/>What worked:<br/><br/>The exploration angle. There were mountains of information to uncover, and I ad-libbed more details during the game. That the players missed stuff didn't matter, because there were a lot of clues leading to the central figures. I flooded them with info so they'd get all the good stuff for sure. I also changed my plans according to their ideas, as I wanted them to succeed. <br/><br/>The setting. The mystery could have sucked, and we'd still have had fun, because there was enough color and mood in the setting to satisfy the players.<br/><br/>The characters. I had written good characters, and the players had fun with them. <br/><br/>The lack of the system. It felt natural to have complete control over everything, without having to make compromises with rules.<br/><br/>What didn't work:<br/><br/>The pacing was rushed. I had planned the game to be a 2/3-session campaign, and ran it as a con game when that fell through. I over-ran my other time slot by an hour and could probably have used one hour more. I still have to run it as a campaign some day, complete with evocative photographs and a slimy late 70s AM radio soundtrack.<br/><br/>Many players complained about a lack of climax. I guess I'm much better in building worlds than narratives. A breadcrumb trail would have helped, but then it hadn't been a game I'd envisioned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372200/#Comment_372200" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T14:41:48+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  2:41PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ethan K.</cite>Run InSpectres?</blockquote>\nTouche, sir.

The secret of my success in both cases was to set up an adventure, not a mystery. That is, the stage was set for the PCs to do exciting and interesting things while investigating a murder, not for the players to recognise obscure clues and engage in intellectual deducery. It is also the case that each of those adventures ended with a non-trivial moral choice to make, and that these were largely what had the players talking after the sessions. But they aren't what kept players involved during the sessions. What kept the players going through the sessions was a series of encounters (with witnesses, bystanders, obstructive officials, material evidence etc.) that called for creative solutions and gave all the players opportunities to show how their characters were different and cool.<br/><br/><i>Canberra by Night</i> was very sandboxy, given a "cozy murder" feel by the fact that the vampire population of Canberra- Queanbeyan was tiny and all PCs except for the victim. <i>Apr\xe8s Moi</i> was much more structured, with the "police procedural" format (though the adventure was actually a "hard-boiled", not a procedural) and the evidence giving a strong lead as to specific places to go and people to interview. Both worked, because both were designed as stages for the player-characters rather than as puzzles for the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372210">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372210/#Comment_372210" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T15:41:03+00:00" title="April 10, 2012  3:41PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2012 3:58PM by stefoid.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is a summary of what I put in Ingenero for 'mysteries and clues'<br/><br/>A Mystery is a puzzle and the clues are the pieces.

If Players need information about what or how to advance, you give it to them, more or less (different subject).   But you withhold the 'why' of the situation - that is the mystery:  'why is this shit happening?'.  Finding and interpreting clues correctly solves the why puzzle.  The cool thing about that is the situation can be resolved without them ever working out <b>why</b>, or coming up with a bunch of wild and whacky whys of their own.  the other cool thing is you dont even have to know why yourself - you can wing the why as you go.  I think this is how crazy shit like Lost gets made.

And on the basis of that experience I heartily endorse Stefoid's advice. An investigative adventure ought to consist of the action or drama that occurs while the characters are working to find the pieces of a puzzle, not the abstract reasoning and flashes of insight (or frustrated perplexity) that occur while the players are putting the pieces together. Design an adventure, not a puzzle.<br/><br/>Something much the same is true of mystery stories, I think. The fun parts of Sherlock Holmes stories occur when he goes out with Watson to encounter minor characters and burgle houses and set traps for villains, not when he stays at home with an ounce of shag tobacco thinking about one of his "four-pipe problems".<br/><br/>My usual players from the period about 1986\u201394 did amass a lot of investigative technique, a toolkit for solving [my] mysteries. Nearly all the tools were things for characters to do to get information, not rules for putting pieces together.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_372282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372282/#Comment_372282" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-10T23:28:08+00:00" title="April 10, 2012 11:28PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 10, 2012 11:37PM by TomasHVM.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Millsy</cite>-\tLots of skill checks to find clues that may or may not be there, that may or may not have been useful<br/>-\tLimited opportunity to demonstrate character (ie, \u2018role-play\u2019) without derailing the flow of the game<br/>-\tA distinct lack of \u2018action\u2019 until the final confrontation, which often became an anticlimax<br/>-\tGames frequently over-running time slots</blockquote>I've just made a tool for my game <i>Fabula</i> that may be a good one to use as part of a solution to this:<br/><br/><b>SCENARIO &amp; SHADOW</b><br/>- the leader of the game take a big sheet of paper (A3) and jot down a list of 4-7 elements (one or two words each) that may be introduced in the game, and which is connected to the scenario. I call this "The Scenario-sheet". <br/>- It is placed in the middle of the gaming table, so the players may see which elements are connected to the plot. This makes the players be "in the know", and makes playing the scenario a simpler task for all.<br/>- the leader will also make another sheet, with details of the elements on the scenario-sheet, and secret elements (usually revealed when players engage one or two elements on the scenario-sheet). I call this "The Shadow-sheet".<br/><br/>Play-testing of this tool so far, has shown it to help a lot informing the players about the nature of the scenario, and to help them frame scenes with elements of substance (players share responsibility for framing scenes in Fabula). There are enough open elements to give direction and drive to the game, while at the same time the shadow-sheet provide the necessary secrets to make the game exciting for all parties.<br/><br/>As said; this may be a good tool to use in investigative games.<br/><br/>BTW: having players frame scenes is often a good way for them to focus on characterization, especially if the leader of the game occasionally sets premises for the scene-framing, like; "This round is for social city-scenes" or "This round is for pleasant travel-scenes" or "Only short scenes on relationships between characters now". Setting framing-premises that drives the game forward is also possible, but that drive often comes without asking, when the scenario-sheet is in place. Players in general are eager to explore the elements on that sheet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372287/#Comment_372287" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T01:21:56+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  1:21AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 11, 2012 1:39AM by GB_Steve.">edited April 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Secondly, I don't think GUMSHOE is a full solution either.

So you need characters with interests and a world that is asking to be explored. It helps, when running a game for a group, if the characters hold some of this in common. Dresden Files, for example, has a direct link between characters created in character generation and I certainly prefer (as a GM) for characters to have something in common. It gives the players a reason to all be at the same table if nothing else. <br/><br/>GUMSHOE calls these two aspects drives and core clues. Call of Cthulhu talks about a mystery being like an onion, layers are stripped away until you arrive at the terrifying core. Other non-Mythos games are available.<br/><br/>I take a sandboxy approach to the start by giving the players lots of leads and seeing what they come up with, the mystery then coallesces in the interaction between the characters and the world, and any ideas I brought to the table (required for a mystery). My current favourite is to use the Occult Guide to London (a gazeteer of strange places, people and events in 30s London) and to ask the players what they want to explore although in the past I've used other kinds of handouts such as pictures of church murals, suitably sepia photographs of a strange mechanism I saw in a country house, a book with an interesting binding, the cover of a French surrealist magazine. If it piques my interest, then I'm hoping that it will do the same for the players, especially if there's a mystery layered behing it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372288/#Comment_372288" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T01:45:29+00:00" title="April 11, 2012  1:45AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, thanks, everyone.

That's how come GUMSHOE has been adapted for a wide range of genres, the common underlying premise is that the players/characters are in the dark about something at the start.<br/><br/>I fully expect there to be a GUMSHOE Taste for Murder soon*.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><sub>*No I don't.</sub> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_372411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Millsy" title="Millsy"><img alt="Millsy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Millsy">Millsy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372411/#Comment_372411" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-11T12:51:18+00:00" title="April 11, 2012 12:51PM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, it's interesting that a lot of the advice is totally relevant for 'non-investigative' one-shots, too.

If you're running an investigative game at a con, the players will expect a mystery, which the GM has planned. Inspectres is great, but it doesn't do that.</blockquote>\nIt doesn't? I've only played in the game, but it certainly seemed like the GM had a mystery planned. Sure, we added some elements like NPCs that fit into the "whodunit" parts, but we never declared who did what or what the mysteries were.<br/><br/>The key is really in how the game is run. Once you've got your scenario and mystery (or "horror") and ideas on how it is effecting the world, then I mostly follow Graham's advice. Let them explore the world a bit, just pinging them slightly on "something is wrong." How subtle or obvious this is depends on the genre and setting. An outright murder mystery might have this be sudden: now there's a dead body. But a more Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Horror mystery might be a slow burn and intial investigations might involve figuring out exactly how wrong things are.<br/><br/>The real trick is how to handle the investigation.  This is important for me. I do not plan out and plant clues. I plan out scenes that have many potential clues in them.  I readily hand players clues that lead to those scenes. Those scenes are places for them to not just investigate more, but look around, interact with characters (which maybe a mix of potential allies, opposition, and innocent bystanders). Even though I don't have specific clues planned, I obviously do have specific clues in mind. But these are mostly vague, only concrete enough to be sure I can lead the players to the next scene (which admittedly, is also fairly vague on where or what that might end up being).<br/><br/>If they miss my bait to a scene, or take initiative and go in an unexpected direction, then I don't try to force them "back on track."  I accept THIS as the new track (even if the party splits and all but 1 player is in the "right spot").  I'll figure out how to make that into a scene with some potential clues.  In a recent game, this meant having something "go wrong" in the vicinity so the player who was wandering could witness the problem first hand. This can mean anything from encountering an NPC that knows something, witnessing a facet of the problem being investigated, or being targeted by the opposition (e.g. two guys with guns kick open the door).<br/><br/>It is a given they are going to get the clues when they are in scenes. They might not recognize them as clues, but I am feeding them information they need, not waiting for them to ask the right question or look in the right place. Completely opposite. I let them ask questions and look everywhere, keeping the emphasis on playing their characters instead of quizzing the GM out of character. I hold out long enough to make things interesting. Usually no more than two fruitless attempts ("Nope, bathroom looks fine.")  Unless they hone in onto things that are spot on for the clues they need, that is ("The bathroom looks fine - spotless, actually. You can still smell cleaner in the air."). After that, I'll start dropping hints like that one to guide them to the right places. Paint the suspicious nature of things into the fiction I present, just as might happen in a novel.<br/><br/>If they start to lose the scene, I have an NPC react to bring them back into character, or if lacking an NPC, some small event or change to their surroundings to bring the focus back to the fiction. Sometimes that initial stonewalling exhausts the players' only one or two ideas they had for investigating, and I didn't pick up on their tone that they're starting to feel lost.  What I do with the NPC reaction or external event is to bring them back into the scene and get them to play in character to react, and I'll use those reactions and interactions to plant the clues and suspicions they need to find a thread (not "my" story thread that I want them to find, but ANY thread that I can think of that will resonate with at least one player).<br/><br/>Before too long, one of two things will happen. They'll figure out the mystery and act on it, or time will start to run long.<br/><br/>If they find the mystery too early, I'll introduce opposition. Now they know the situation, it's not so easy to resolve. This could be an antagonist, or even people who are supposed to be allies ("You're up shit creek, McNulty!"). This could be a twist, if I can think of one that fits (the clues are generally loose enough to fill in new details) or a secondary antagonist mucking things up. Otherwise, I'll let the ending unfold. I always try to err on the side of ending early if I'm uncertain on whether it's "too early" or not, or if stretching it out just doesn't feel right.<br/><br/>If things are running long, and they're not getting the solution, I'll either try to feed them more info in the same manner, so that they can connect the dots. If they can't, then I'll have the mountain come to Mohammed and bring the antagonist or whatever source of the problem is, out into the open. This might mean making a mistake, or it might be an antagonist gunning for the PCs because she recognizes that they now "know too much" or are getting too close.<br/><br/>I don't think there's any particular game that does this style better than others, except that the game needs to be light enough to allow for this level of improvisation. For me, that means pretty light systems, but adepts of HERO or D&amp;D may be comfortable enough with their systems, so it mostly depends on the GM. Regardless, keep the rolls focused on interesting decisions. In some games, this means you can roll for clues because a failed roll still can mean success, just one filled with new problems or great costs. In other games, this means keeping the clue finding to player interaction, and using the game mechanics for complications and dealing with opposition to their goals.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_372824">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/372824/#Comment_372824" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-14T07:03:17+00:00" title="April 14, 2012  7:03AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Expanding on the stuff that's talked about in my link:<br/><br/>Don't prep clues, scenes, or reveals.<br/><br/>Prep what has happened. Prep who the NPCs *are* as people. Prep what the scenery looks like. Prep what will happen if the PCs fail to get anything done.<br/><br/>When the PCs investigate the scene of a crime, you've now prepped what happened there, and what the place looks like. So you can extrapolate the clues. The PCs check under the bed or whatever -- do they find anything? Based on what happened and what this place looks like, is there anything to find? If so, they find it.<br/><br/>Same thing goes for when they interrogate NPCs. Based on what has happened, does this NPC know anything? Based on who he is, will he give up that information easily? You should be able to extrapolate the conditions in which the NPC will spill his guts, and how much he will spill.<br/><br/>What happens next? Part of this is based on what would happen if the PCs failed to do anything. Other than that, it depends on what kind of mystery you're in. I don't know enough about the Agatha Christie style of mystery, but I've got a handle on two others: the hard-boiled detective style, and the serial killer procedural. The hard-boiled detective goes out and stirs shit up among all the suspects until one of them does something (often another crime) happens that gives him a lead -- so, based on who the PCs talked to, and what they said, and what they learned, what do the NPCs do next? In the serial killer procedural, if the PCs are too slow to figure it out, then the killer kills someone else, which gives the PCs new leads and evidence to explore. (This is mostly what the Hex Ranger link is based on.) And you don't hide the new murder; you call it to the PCs' attention                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_373194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/elkin" title="elkin"><img alt="elkin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/elkin">elkin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/373194/#Comment_373194" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-17T04:10:52+00:00" title="April 17, 2012  4:10AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There's some great advice in this thread. I'll share my two bits.<br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of InSpectres, and it provided me with some crazy fun. That said, it wasn't the kind of fun I had from reading detective novels. I've tried several different game types before I finally managed to design and run a successful detective scenario that can fit a convention time slot and (ideally) give the players the same type of rush they get from reading a detective story. I've used GUMSHOE, but I believe the game would have worked with more traditional systems as well.<br/><br/>Here are some lessons learned:<br/>* This is the most important one: don't make it complicated. A 4-hour roleplaying game covers considerably less fictional content than a novel or even a short story, and the players rarely have the exceptional powers of deduction which the protagonists of such stories have. Make it a simple story (a quarrel between two lovers ended in a gruesome murder) with a single twist (the killer was under demonic possession).<br/>In general, avoid red herrings, unless they are readily recognizable as such, and can be tracked back to the person who planted them. The more you complicate the basic story, the more you risk running out of time, and denying the players the fun of actually solving the mystery.<br/><br/>* Like people said before me, don't make it all about the mystery: make it about exploration. Make sure the world and/or the PCs are fun to explore in their own right. In many detective novels, the investigation is just an excuse for the reader to get a peek into a different world.<br/><br/>* Make sure the game has clear stakes and clear success and failure conditions. If the PCs are solving a kidnapping case, make sure you follow the game time and make note of when the kidnappers plan on killing the victim. Make sure the players are well-aware of what's at stake. This way, failed rolls mean spent time, meaning less chances of rescuing the victim.<br/><br/>* Don't force action scenes into the game, but make sure that some sections of the trail pass through some rough territory. It's not a crime drama if there aren't any dangerous criminals around.<br/><br/>* Make clues plentiful and easy to find. Make sure each essential clue points towards a new location or person, and that each non-essential clue provides intriguing information about the crime or the world in general. Make sure clues are rewarding, and make sure each location and person can provide several such clues.<br/><br/>* Give the PCs different resources to bring to the table. This can be stuff like specialized equipment or knowledge, police rank, organized crime contacts and so forth. None of this stuff should be vital to solving the crime, but it should let them make some shortcuts and have their characters shine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383290">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383290/#Comment_383290" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-24T23:14:37+00:00" title="June 24, 2012 11:14PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry I'm a bit late, but there's a background generator at Abulafia: <a href="http://www.random-generator.com/index.php?title=Occult_Case_Report" rel="nofollow">Occult Case Report</a>.<br/><br/>It's what I use for quick articles on investigations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
