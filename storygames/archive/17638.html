And I hated it. I'm not being hyperbolic; I left that table with a bad taste in my mouth not just for the game but for the people that introduced it to me (which is totally unfair, but emotions will be emotions). But I get the feeling from the way everyone else talks about it that it's actually a much better game than my experience would suggest; just because I happened to grab the one skunky beer in the six pack doesn't mean the entire batch is bad.<br/><br/>I'm happy to provide as many details as I can remember if it helps anyone, but to make a long story short I felt completely railroaded, like I didn't have any control over my character or where the game was going. And yeah, I get that there's a sort of definite ending there, but the ending of nearly every scene was completely unsatisfying. The game always went in the direction my "opposition" pushed it and I felt utterly powerless to stop it. Maybe I just don't know how to play? Mathalus was in the game, too, and I remember him having issues, as well. We're both Burners, so maybe going from Burning Wheel to Polaris just puts you in a bad frame of mind? I don't know.<br/><br/>Anyway, my mind is open. Absolve me of my bias.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399537">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399537/#Comment_399537" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T09:52:18+00:00" title="December  4, 2012  9:52AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How did the game feel when you were the Mistaken (or one of the Moons)?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399539">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399539/#Comment_399539" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T09:59:39+00:00" title="December  4, 2012  9:59AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I assume you mean when I was the opposition?

If even one person flinches, that crack will break things apart.<br/><br/>It kind of helps to have a "we are not friends, we are engaging in a thing where we owe it to each other to push hard" ritual or something to start you off.  The scene structure helps too.  Push hard in the scene, use the phrases to push the other player(s) around, don't worry about social consequence until after.  Break between scenes and talk about it.<br/><br/>I find it more off-putting in that game to play with weak or yielding opposition, unless I'm convinced they are up to something.<br/><br/>The long and the short of it is, you have extremely powerful tools at your disposal, and you are never railroaded.  But you will absolutely have to compromise and give in.  The trick is making the Mistaken give just as much, and grab as much good as you can in your descent to ruin.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399546">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399546/#Comment_399546" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T11:05:27+00:00" title="December  4, 2012 11:05AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't expect that from the game at all.

But I think there's a difference between having a hard-core attitude about the game and its fiction, and having a sink-or-swim attitude with regards to a new player's knowledge of the rules. I mean, it sounds like these people did a shitty job teaching the rules, on two levels:<br/><br/>1) They had a greater knowledge of the ritual phrases than you, and didn't clue you in as to how they work. That is shitty behavior, right there.<br/><br/>2) It's actually a rule that if you're feeling uncomfortable OOG, the group has to pause and talk about it. So obviously these folks weren't playing with that rule, which means <i>they</i> were the ones playing wrong, not you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399549/#Comment_399549" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T11:55:01+00:00" title="December  4, 2012 11:55AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Zelbinian,<br/><br/>You're clearly identifying that you didn't feel supported by your fellow players (in addition to other issues). A great move would be to contact them and talk about your experience with them, in blame-free language designed to improve your experience next time.<br/><br/>Maybe you needed more teaching and examples. Maybe you needed reference sheets. Maybe you needed a clear conversation about expectations and boundaries prior to play.<br/><br/>At current, what you're saying sounds like "I had a bad experience, it was so awful, maybe I'll hate this game forever."

When we played last year, we had the phrases printed off in front of us, and our style of play was slow and lingering, such that if someone said something, we could take a moment to look over the list and decide how to respond.

To figure out what went wrong. Every time I hear anyone else talk about Polaris, it's usually with exuberant praise, and often these people enjoy other games that I also enjoy, so I feel like I didn't actually play the game everyone else played. But I don't own the game and, well, no one runs out to buy a game they didn't enjoy, so I'm hoping people that are more experienced with it can help me solidly identify things that went wrong so I can look out for those next time I play - and there will be a next time, I promise you. (Alternatively, if it's a game that's easy enough to play on a forum and peeps are willing to take me under their wing, that'd also be awesome.)<br/><br/>Deliverator seems to have exposed a lot of those points, which gives me information for next time I play: I can tell the person, hey, I'm cool with bringing the heat, but let's go at like, 1/2 speed until I get a feel for the rules. Perhaps little else needs to be said, but if there's any other advice you'd give to a Polaris beginner I'd love to hear it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399568">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399568/#Comment_399568" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T12:51:25+00:00" title="December  4, 2012 12:51PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Cool.<br/><br/>Make sure to have a list of the key phrases in hand. Hans linked them.<br/><br/>Ask to go slow and build up fluency. Several people in this thread have provided good sentences that you could borrow, in requesting that support. Ask if you could all spend fifteen minutes using the phrases in an example scene. Don't play with them if they say no (not to be petty, but because they're refusing to teach you how to do an emotionally vulnerable thing they want you to do with them).<br/><br/>Speak up if you feel trounced. A good sentence is, "Hey, I'm feeling overwhelmed and trounced, as a player. Can we fix that?"<br/><br/>Relish the tragedy. This is a character who might end the game with a cursed demon tentacle arm, with a dead husband, responsible for putting a demonling on the South-District throne. If "but only if" was used right, though, it'll also be a character who slayed demons in droves, who rescued a child at great personal expense, and who kept the library tomes out of the hands of the abyss. Be excited for the prices you'll have to pay. This isn't a requirement for every game, but certainly Polaris.<br/><br/>Play with people you trust. It sounds like your trust here is shaken. Either rebuild that trust with these players, or find different players. The bad experience you had wasn't necessarily their fault (they might not have understood your needs), and it wasn't necessarily your fault (you might not have known how to ask for support). But certainly avoid that same bewildered/trounced dynamic that you had last time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399569/#Comment_399569" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T12:53:11+00:00" title="December  4, 2012 12:53PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for your thoughts everybody, I already feel a lot more comfortable about trying this game again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399570/#Comment_399570" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T12:53:47+00:00" title="December  4, 2012 12:53PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's great to hear!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399611/#Comment_399611" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T16:50:47+00:00" title="December  4, 2012  4:50PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Whenever I would yield or pause too long while trying to figure out what recourse I had, suddenly 10 things happened and all of them were Not Okay. </blockquote>\nI assume this isn't literal -- like, you paused, and so the other guy kept talking nonstop, adding more and more things? Because that's just incredibly poor faith/play on their part, particularly if they were aware that you were just learning the game.<br/><br/>If on the other hand you mean, your responses tended to be a form of stalling, and every time you would stall your opposition would come back with some new development: that's an issue to address within the game, rather than the social level. It's very important, in my experience, to match scope with your opposition, so that the 'back and forth' is approximately even, in terms of impact on the story -- if one of the players is constantly leaping ten steps forward, while the other takes a measured pace back, then you won't end up with a very satisfying story. It's not <i>tragic</i> if good steamrolls over evil, or vice versa.<br/><br/>Negotiating that scope is probably worth being explicit about, with first-time players, though ideally it is something the players will work out organically as play proceeds -- that way, different scenes can operate at different paces, etc. Also, scope-creep is often an issue in Polaris ('but only if I stab him in the eye, mortally wounding him!' --&gt; 'but only if you are then thrown into prison for six years while your family is murdered!' --&gt; 'but only if, one night, the stars come down to me in prison and whisper in my ear their secret perfect names'.) It's easy to end up with a scene where actions are taking place at all sorts of different levels, and for an inexperienced player (or non-cooperative play-group) that can easily be abused to screw over different parties.<br/><br/>Of course, scope of action isn't the only important thing -- equally key is scope of emotion/investment. So sometimes your opponent might narrate some sweeping epic event that takes place over several days and your response could be a single, brief moment. It all depends what you want. At its core I think the game is kind of about this: figuring out what really matters, to you and to your opponent, while trying to keep them in the dark about the same thing. The worst result as a Mistaken in Polaris is narrating some Super-Horrible Bad Thing and then noticing that the Heart player is kind of shrugging and smiling to herself -- that means you just gave them something for free, because you misunderstood what matters to them about their character. But the point of that interaction is not to beat the other person, exactly -- it's just a mechanism for the players to <i>discover</i> these things about each other, in a narratively competitive environment.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_399613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399613/#Comment_399613" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T17:36:27+00:00" title="December  4, 2012  5:36PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dustin, are you talking about this <a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/12894241" rel="nofollow">Battlestar Galactica-Polaris</a> game from last year?<br/><br/>I don't know if you ever saw this original discussion thread or not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399903">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian" title="Zelbinian"><img alt="Zelbinian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/056/nMYJBWP65457Z.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Zelbinian">Zelbinian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399903/#Comment_399903" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-06T23:11:45+00:00" title="December  6, 2012 11:11PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, that was it!

I can only assume they had become accustomed to the hard-and-fast style of play, probably because that was the fun way to play for them, which is cool. But I usually have a tough time in situations like that. I can do adversarial stuff if I'm comfortable with the people around me and if I'm giving time to strategize a bit but, like... I don't even do PvP in video games. I'm not terribly competitive. So they had me over a barrel pretty quickly. Part of the reason for starting this thread was to figure out if Polaris is <i>supposed</i> to be that way or whether that's just one way you can do it, so thanks for helping to clear that up.<br/><br/>We may have had a list of the phrases, but I don't remember ever referring to it so I don't think we did. Could be wrong. I know we had that moons sheet or whatever. The phrases were at least explained, but I didn't really internalize it.<br/><br/>I think another thing that would've helped is having a clear goal for my character. I wasn't just playing to find out what happens, I was playing to find out what was happening at all. I thought I'd have time to feel out my character a little bit, but shit hit the fan from moment one and I was lost pretty much immediately. This game seems to need you to know where you want to have your character ultimately end up so you can push for it. But if you don't have a goal in mind... even with a list of those phrases, probably you're gonna get boned.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard" title="AMBayard"><img alt="AMBayard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AMBayard">AMBayard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401068/#Comment_401068" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T09:42:43+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  9:42AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As I understand it -- and the way it's worked best in my experience -- is that the Heart's goal is pretty much always to make the very best thing possible happen for the protagonist, and the Mistaken's goal is to make life utterly horrible for the protagonist. It doesn't really matter if either side talks for a long time because there are so many tools to amend a statement or negate completely. That said, it doesn't seem reasonable that a player should be able to talk for half an hour describing a long list of bad things. It's not "<b>but only if</b> your dog dies, you get cancer, you burst into flame, you are cast out of society, you lose your sense of smell, and you get the hiccups," it's just one bad thing at a time. I don't know if that's in the rules or not (it probably is), but it seems like it would be contrary to the idea of collaborative storytelling (played in a dark room lit by candles) if you have to shout the key phrases and shut people down in order to play.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_401078">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401078/#Comment_401078" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T11:22:17+00:00" title="December 17, 2012 11:22AM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry you had a bad time.<br/><br/>The intent is that you'll have a reference sheet for key phrases in front of you at all times until you've internalized them. Memorization is not a part of the challenge of Polaris.<br/><br/>Thinking on your feet, though, is. If you're not a thinker-on-feet the game will be hard.<br/><br/>Interrupting each other is just rude. I don't think that there's a rule against it or anything, but that's because I didn't imagine it would be a problem.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Here, I will write a new key phrase for you: "Wait wait hold on a second." Take a break, wherein you can ask questions about the current state of play, think about what you want to say next. This phrase interrupts the game where it is. When you have got your head together and gotten advice, return to play just as you left it. If you responded to an interruption with this phrase, finish what you were saying before you were interrupted.<br/><br/>Here's another one: "Can we play this straight first?" Play a session of regular Polaris before doing whatever hack.<br/><br/>Consider those official errata.<br/><br/>--<br/><br/>Here's another thought.<br/><br/>In BW, the outcomes of a particular conflict are relatively constraints, by chance and system. It's reasonable to expect that you'll win this fight, lose that one, that reading a book won't lead to the death of your family. Most conflicts in Burning Wheel are _safe_, not in that you won't lose, but in that you understand what's at risk going in. In Polaris, the only constraints on conflict are what the players think is cool. So ... that's a lot more scope and responsibility in terms of play. Nothing is ever safe. It can be a really hard adjustment to make, and it isn't for everyone.<br/><br/>Not sure if that goes anywhere. Just a passing thought.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_401097">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/401097/#Comment_401097" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-17T14:14:29+00:00" title="December 17, 2012  2:14PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I felt like I had no time to think or catch my breath. Whenever I would yield or pause too long while trying to figure out what recourse I had, suddenly 10 things happened and all of them were Not Okay.</blockquote>\nI get that's how you felt but for everyone interpreting that literally, no it's not what happened.<br/><br/>Dustin, have you looked at <a href="http://www.storygamesseattle.com/messages/boards/thread/12894241" rel="nofollow">the thread where Morgan and I discussed the game a year and a half ago</a>? You might find that you made a lot more happen than you are recalling. Like the very first scene: the situation I set up was that your partner was in the brig on suspicion of being a cylon. That's all. You decided to bust her out of jail which started you being on the run and branded a traitor by your own military. I'm not saying that was a bad idea (quite the opposite -- I liked it a lot because it got the action going) but that wasn't exactly me dumping crazy stuff on you. Or am I missing something there?<br/><br/>From what you've said it sounds like you haven't read Polaris--and you probably don't remember this from the pitch way back when--but Polaris has tragedy baked-in. It's not a tone-neutral game. The end for the protagonist is always either death or turning into a demon (or in our setting a cylon or cylon sympathizer). It's an actual rule of the game.<br/><br/>Almost everyone I've seen have a terrible time with Polaris were pros at normal player+GM games, because there are a lot of ways that Polaris might look like one of those games on the surface but it is designed completely differently. It sometimes looks like a duck but it's not that duck. The wrong instincts kick in.<br/><br/>For example it's easy to mistake the antagonist for the GM and just go along with what they say as being established world facts and feel like you're powerless. But in fact the protagonist and antagonist are entirely equal in their creative power. If the one player introduces anything the other doesn't like they can always jump straight to "You Ask Far Too Much". I know we had this discussion during the game but I was pretty sure even then I wasn't getting the point across. There can be a lot to absorb.<br/><br/>Like I said in the post-game thread, the game is not really competitive:\n<blockquote>The real mistake (and this is a teaching failure on my part) is to think it's competitive. Bold, underline, italicize this part. It really, really isn't. If you think it's competitive you'll be making decisions for all the wrong reasons and the game will spiral into frustration. I think both you and Dustin caught some of this.<br/><br/>\tThe ideal case (and this is true for just about all story games) is that both sides play equally hard, and push each other to interesting results. It's not competition, because neither side is trying to actually win. The protagonist player doesn't actually want to skate through the game unchallenged, and the antagonist player doesn't actually want to crush the protagonist like a bug. Neither is any fun.</blockquote>\nIt may look like we're being competitive because the antagonist is pushing for bad outcomes and the protagonist is pushing for good outcomes, but actually we know it's going to turn out badly for the protagonist in the long run. The real question becomes: how does the hero deal with all this bad stuff? They go down but how do they go down? What do they fight for? Do they stand true to the end or cave and become a mockery of their own ideals? We're playing in good faith and trying to explore that. Like I said in the first thread, the antagonist is trying to find things that matter to the protagonist so we can see how far the protagonist would go to try to save them (really, I could copy and paste a whole long chunk of that thread because that's what it's all about).<br/><br/>Because of that it's important that the protagonist player not think of the character as their property the way you might in a traditional adventure game. That's not the dynamic at all. The protagonist is the center of the story and we're all watching what happens in their life, but we all have a lot of input because it's the one story we're all playing together (when that character is up). We're constantly intruding on the character. The flip side is that it's essential the protagonist player makes their character an open book to the other players: the whole point is to get in their head and understand their drama. If we don't understand them or can't see how they feel about stuff it's moot.<br/><br/>All in all, you're right, that game sucked. It was clear you weren't having fun during the game but I thought we sorted out some of the misunderstandings and turned things around by the end (when you took over the rebellion et cetera) and then hung out afterwards and talked about Burning Wheel.<br/><br/>But keep in mind that while you didn't have fun the other three people at the table didn't either. If you think me and Cy walked away going "woo hoo! we won!" I don't know what to tell you. Spending your afternoon trying to teach someone a complex game and having their reaction be that you're bullying or taking advantage of them is pretty frustrating.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
