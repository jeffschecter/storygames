WOW!"<br/><br/>Great stuff.<br/><br/>My only coulda-shoulda for the session is that I should have suggested that the climatic scene conflicts for Marie and Augustus should have been about their characters' issues, but that's a relatively minor thing.  We were ALL about character issues in our conflicts for last episode -- probably too much -- and this time not quite enough, so I think of it as a zeroing in process.<br/><br/>The session ended with at least a half-hour of us babbling about all the cool stuff in the session, the cool stuff in the rules, how we were really figuring it out, and just general "Gosh that was GOOD!" talk.  Very very gratifying.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
