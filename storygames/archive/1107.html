                    The other day I told my friends that I wanted to playtest my <a href="http://neko-rpg.blogspot.com/2006/08/three-things-i-like-about-tokyo-heroes.html" rel="nofollow">Tokyo Heroes</a> (sentai) game in the near future, and we wound up scheduling the first session for this Saturday, which means I have three days.<br/>It occurred to me that while the game it set up to divide things into scenes (although it's not hugely important mechanically), I've never actually run or played a game that uses scene framing. (And shame on me, for not having tried out PTA yet...)<br/><br/>I'm not hugely worried about this, but I am curious if anyone has any advice/reccomendations on how to use scene framing, both in actual play and game design.                </div>

                            Have you read the relevant bits of PTA? I'd look at that, and maybe Dogs.<br/><br/>Think of it this way: Start where the action is, not way before.<br/><br/>"You're a teen-age princess, riding away from the burning ruins of your family castle. You have a map and a name. Go!"<br/><br/>is *waaay* more interesting than<br/><br/>"You're a teen-age princess locked in your bedroom because you won't marry who your father wants. Go!"<br/><br/>The first is full of motion and action and stuff to do, the second is....flat. Ending a scene is similar. I find it very handy to think of soap operas or sit-coms or cheesey late-night horror movies for this. Don't just let the scene drag and die and ooze weirdly into the next scene, cut the darn thing off!<br/><br/>"You skewer the traitor to the wall, cursing him in the name of your dead father. Cool! Ok, next scene - it's morning and you're at the graveside of your father, knowing you've avenged him. Go!"<br/><br/>instead of<br/><br/>"You skewer the traitor to the wall, cursing him in the name of your dead father. After cleaning your sword, you need to find your horse. You're also a little hungry after that fight, so maybe find a rabbit or something to eat......"                        </div>

                            What Meg says is good.  I don't know where it comes from, but it seems to me that we gamers like to s t r e t c h  e v e r y t h i n g  o u t to ridiculous degrees.  It may come from poorly-executed simmy sensibilities (well, it's the rational and in-world justified thing to make your epic hero hunt rabbits next) or (to be utterly cynical about it) from prolonging the build-up because we expect the climax to suck.<br/><br/>The thing to keep in mind is deceptively simple.  Consider at the beginning of each scene what you want to accomplish or see happen.  Then do that.  Don't lead up to that.  Frame the thing that you want to see directly.  When you're done doing the thing you wanted to see, cut to the next scene.<br/><br/>This is harder than it seems, because as audience members to our own stories, we automatically think about what the character is going to do next or what the character would do in order to get to the thing that we want to see.  The key is that you don't have to <em>play</em> that part out unless the denouement or build-up is specifically interesting in and of itself.  That stuff -- the walking up to the front door, the rabbit-hunting afterwards -- will still "be there" but it can be implied rather than explicitly narrated.  Picture a scene that starts as the heroes walk into the office of some underworld contact and they're eating popsicles.  Obviously they got some popsicles on the way in, right?  Maybe there's an ice cream truck outside, or maybe they roughed up some kids or something, or whatever, but it doesn't really matter (and it lets players have their character pipe up and comment about those whiney kids or whatever, retroactively creating the build-up to the current scene, which can be <em>awesome</em>).<br/><br/>(Caveat: different players will have different tolerances for how much player character decisions can be implied by scene framing.  I <em>love</em> to start scenes like "So you have Boss Natan up against the wall, your fingers around his throat, his face purpling and sputtering" and then let the players figure out how they got to that point.  Other folks might see that as crossing the line and making decisions for them.  So start easy and slowly elaborate to find the sweet spot for your players.)<br/><br/>In order to get good scene framing going, I find it's useful to have a formal procedure.  This can be as simple as each player getting a turn and declaring what they want to see happen.  Then that player and/or the others frame the scene with situation and little details to make that happen.  That's all you really need.  The complicated bits are (a) deciding who gets to be that first player for each scene and (b) figuring out who says what in the ensuing scene framing.                        </div>

                            Josh and Meg steal all the good answers. <br/><br/>This excercise helped me way back in the day. Tonight take one or two of your favorite movies, especially movies in a genre like the game you are going to play, and watch them. Every time a scene starts or ends, pause the movie for a moment and think "If I were running this movie as a game, would I have started or ended the scene there? Why or why not?" <br/><br/>Doing a similar thing with graphic novels is often a good excercise. The first Artesia graphic novel is particularly good for this, as are the Lone Wolf and Cub books. Check those out, give them a read through, and watch how the action skips from important point to important point.<br/><br/>The thing about scene framing is that you see it all the time outside of game. There isn't a TV show or movie made that doesn't frame its scenes, and even the longest winded novel has scenes with some sort of frame. So just watch how those mediums do it, and it'll help you start paying attention to pacing and buildup in game as well.                        </div>

                            Everyone has the right idea, but there's still an air of skepticism about it. The fear is that by "skipping" something to get to the meaty part, that you might be taking away a player's ability to make choices for the character. <br/><br/>There are two ways to be sure this won't be a problem. First, be sure that whatever you frame to, the player has some interesting thing to do in the scene. Generally what players really resent is being put into situations where they don't really have a choice of what to do. That is, they'll complain that it's a lack of control of the character as if they wanted to control getting to the scene. But what they're missing is that what they're really complaining about is that the current scene doesn't have anything for them to do. <br/><br/>This is the age-old GM-player conflict and how it tends to come to a head. The GM wanting to protect his plot, gives the players few real choices if any. So the player assumes that any GM control of his character is bad, that it can only lead to a lack of decisions. If you actually set up situations where the player has choices, and let those choices direct where play goes next, then the player will not even notice that you've controlled his character's actions.<br/><br/>Now, again, this assumes a player who is not so conditioned by previous GMs that he will make kneejerk reactions. If you have a player with Abused Player Syndrome (APS), then you're going to have a trial getting them to trust you. But it usually doesn't take too long. Simply use more traditional framing, and make sure that the scenes are open-ended. <br/><br/>The second thing to do in terms of getting players to trust your scene framing is to let them do it. If you let them frame the scenes, then they can hardly complain about control, can they? What happens, then, is that they come to understand that, as they are allowed to have such control, that the GM can't be abusing that control when it's in his hands. Rather, if they see you framing past something that they find interesting - this happens quite a lot, actually - if they feel comfortable saying, "hey, wait, let's do this scene first!" then the problem never arises. <br/><br/>So that's the two things you have to do with scene framing:<br/>1. Allow players to frame<br/>2. When you do frame, frame to a place where the player can then take control with his character. <br/><br/>It's pretty simple, use your power to frame to enable players to be creative, including sharing them. If you do this, then you can get pretty darn radical with your scene framing, and everybody will enjoy it. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            Holy crap, this hits right where I was making mistakes last night with The Mountain Witch! The rules worked better, conflicts worked better, players Aided and adjusted Trust appropriately, but I was way too simmy with things. I think this was partly because of old habits of mine and partly because I have newbies and old-school players, so expectations are probably a bit different from most "indie-think." So I wasted a lot of time getting to the good stuff rather than starting there. I have a few personal solutions to this, but the advice above is equally invaluable.                        </div>

                            I'm probably going to say what other people said but in my own words.<br/><br/>1. There's some situation that the GM or players created. This situation nudges the story forward and pushes the characters into action.<br/><br/>Example: A new plasma rifle is found to be faulty and dangerous. Several of the player characters are involved somehow.<br/><br/>2. The GM collects the goals and drives of the players (which includes the fictional goals and drives of the characters). <br/><br/>Example: Bob the engineer wants to expose the new product as faulty and dangerous. Sam the movie star wants to make scads of money off the product endorsements since his name is on the thing. Alice the CEO wants to avoid being blamed for anything, including cancelling the project or releasing a dangerous product.<br/><br/>3. In his head, the GM advances time quickly, imagining a place where things naturally converge. This is an "arena" where all parties involved in a conflict get to showcase their characters' motivations and fight for their goals.<br/><br/>Example: Adam the GM imagines the engineer discovering the faults, but there's not much conflict there. He consults with Bob quickly to verify Bob wants to take this public. He checks in with the other players, too. Sam wants to keep the product live. Alice wants to monitor the situation closely and maneuver to stay on the safe side. The GM imagines Bob taking things up the corporate ladder. That's when the conflicts will start.<br/><br/>3. The GM presses pause at the point that outcomes aren't very clear -- the first point of conflict, usually. This is the first "frame" of the scene. <br/><br/>Example: The GM imagines a high profile board meeting where all the characters involved can interact and pursue their goals. This is the first time these characters get to interact in a conflicting manner.<br/><br/>4. The GM shares his vision of the scene with the other players. Right now, it's a still frame, but it suggests a situation and suggests how things might be in motion.<br/><br/>Example: The GM suggests the board room to the other players. They like it. The GM describes a lush board room full of important C-level company officers, the corporate board, important stockholders, and various VPs and managers involved in the plasma gun project. Also, the marketing sponsor, Sam's movie star character, is here with his lawyers, too. It starts with tension -- everyone know that there's this question about pulling the plug on the product. Sam and other invested corporate officers want it to go to market. Bob and other well-meaning project managers are concerned for the public's safety. Alice wants someone else to take the fall for the failure, either way. Lots of other GM-controlled characters want to avoid taking the fall. Whatever happens, it'll be interesting.<br/><br/><br/>Some games give the GM all authority over scene framing. Other games give it all to the players. A lot of games are silent on the matter. I agree with Mike that letting players frame scenes can be a good idea but sometimes the GM has to be more aggressive to keep the pace of the game going.                        </div>

                            I agree, I love that procedure! I've been doing a lot of it (with an added step for genre emulation) for EVER in superhero games.<br/>
<br/>
The danger of scene framing has nothing whatever to do with Abused Player Syndrome, though, it has to do with the fact that sometimes not doing anything is absolutely crucial. If you (as a GM) say "the next scene important to advancing the plot is getting some information from some goons that you've found", anything the players suggest, even if brilliant ("Let's have a training montage where I express doubts about your commitment to fighting crime!") seem to everyone to be essentially worthless.  After all, the scene that comes after was going to happen after anyway.  You might as well not have even bothered to show up.  For some players, engagement with their characters and (more important) with other people's characters and contributions only comes during times when nothing much is happening, during the "hm, gotta stop and have lunch" bits of your overland trek to throw the One Ring in the volcano.                        </div>

                            Hey, <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Neko, everyon'e already given you great advice, but I just wanted to raise a small point. You may be talking about <i>agressive</i> scene framing, rather than simple scene framing, or traditional framing, as Mike called it above.<br/><br/>I submit to you that you've already used scene framing in your gaming, even if you didn't realise it.<br/><br/>Every time the GM says something like "ok, does anybody have anything they'd like to do? no? ok, then, it's three days later, in mid morning, when suddenly a strager walks up to you...", that's scene framing right there. Also, if instead of replying "no" to the above question, a player says, "yes, i'd like to find out who the best swordsmith in the city is" and the GM segues with "ok, you make a couple of inquiries iin the marketplace, and a trader finally points you towards a blacksmith shop in a nearby side street, what do you do?", that too is scene framing.<br/><br/>So, really, there's nothing mysterious about this particular technique. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> However, PTA does call for a bit more agressiveness in framing.<br/><br/>For our group, our difficulties didn't lie with starting the scene, as any of the examples in the above paragraph would have been par for the course for our PTA game. We did have a problem figuring out where to cut scenes. Initially, as producer, I had a radical tendency to abrutly terminate a scene whenever I felt the onset of fluff. At least one player in the group got upset a couple of times, wanting to finish out some in-character dialog. Eventually, we found a good balance between my need to move along and his need to be his character.<br/><br/>You'll need to find that balance for your group as well, but in practice, it's a lot easier than it sounds. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Hope to have been of help.<br/><br/>Cheers,<br/>J.                        </div>

                            Like J, I have found that (in some cases) I can frame into a scene well (and fairly aggressively, I would go further but I think my players wouldn't care for it), but knowing when to (&amp; performing) the cut 'out' is the problem.<br/><br/>With Dogs where each conflict pretty much has a clear begining and end (and this coincides with a full scene 90% of the time), this isn't an issue. But with something like Sorcerer (which I haven't played yet) or traditional games (Vampire, et. al) where rolls resolve 'actions', rather than 'scenes', my players always want to "keep on going" in a scene after the primary conflict has played out.<br/><br/>I do my best to cut things off by jumping in and saying something like "OK, what goal do you want to achieve <i>now</i>?" (that phrase has become my GMing trademark) but I am wary about cutting out too soon (and thus my players not feeling like they have had time to portray their characters' reactions) or too late (and the game losing pace and focus because people are still saying their goodbyes or whatever). Any suggestions on how to find the correct moment to shout "cut!"? Any other help is always welcome too <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Warren: What's an example of "aggressive" framing, something your players wouldn't care for? I wonder if certain games lend themselves to overly aggressive framing..?                        </div>

                            OK, this is assuming the scene request was something like "We want to confront Brinarsky and find out what he knows about this." (Edit: This is a low/moderate-powered, somwhat political, Camarilla, oWoD Vampire game, if it matters)<br/><br/>What used to happen: "OK, I call up my contact and find out where Brinarsky will be tonight." "Wait! Do we want to call your contact? Shouldn't we ask that woman -- you know, the one we saw him with before?" (insert 10 minute argument) "OK, I call up my contact" (insert 5 minute phone call that has to be 'roleplayed' out, even though no character is really revealed during the conversation) "OK, now how do we get there?" "We should use the metro train", "I'll steal a car" (insert 10 minute argument) before finally arriving at the destination, which is where I now frame to ('cos that's the interesting bit, dammit!) <br/><br/>This is as 'aggressive' as I can get away with: <i>"OK, you make a couple of phone calls and get told to meet him at his family's resturant downtown at midnight. When you arrive, Brinarsky is inside, eating, flanked by a couple of his goons."</i><br/><br/>This is as aggressive as I would like: <i>"OK, you make a couple of phone calls and get told to meet him at his family's resturant downtown at midnight. When you arrive, Brinarsky is there with a plateful of meatballs, flanked by a couple of his goons. "What the fuck is all this about?""</i> I can do this sometimes, but there are still a few cries of "But we wanted to prepare more!" even though if I let them, they don't do anything meaningful before getting to this point anyway.<br/><br/>I'm sure you could go more aggressive; <i>"You have your hands around Brinarsky's throat, pinning him to the wall of his family's resturant. He glances at his two goons. You took them out easily enough and they are now sprawled unconscious across the table, face down in a plateful of meatballs. He looks back at you, 'What? What do you want?'"</i>, but I think that's taking too much from the players.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: warren</cite>...but there are still a few cries of "But we wanted to prepare more!" even though if I let them, they don't do anything meaningful before getting to this point anyway.</blockquote>
Just as a short note, don't mistake "prepare" for "do anything that significantly enhances our chances of success" or "express something significant about my character."  They may mean (whether they know it or not) that <em>the players</em> want to prepare by getting into character beforehand -- which may not generate anything perceptible to the other players, but still get them in their groove.<br/><br/>Mode of entry, to take one example, can really get people into character.  In a WoD setting, there are many, many options (walk/bus/drive/steal car/plumb sewers/teleport/front door/back door) and each character will have a different sort of idiom for how they do things.  Three ways to avoid the "but but but... prepare!" protest: (a) get to know the character and/or group idiom and narrate that in -- usually this is only possible after you've got to know them well, and have let them narrate their mode of entry beforehand; (b) play a game in which mode of entry is relatively constrained -- if, say, the characters were members of a band (great cover) and drove around in a van with the band's logo on it; (c) frame as aggressively as you like with the patent and explicit understanding that the players can retroactively narrate how they got there -- when you say, "hands around his throat, dead guards," they can say, "I stand up from the guards on whom I jumped on after bursting through the ceiling tiles."                        </div>

                            Awesome distinction, JBR, and one I have not drawn in scene framing discussions. I think this may be a big piece of the picture in my group, bigger than I have previously scene, and why they are resistant to regular scene framing, as well as player-driven scene framing.                        </div>
