<p>Related to the discussion of <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=1392" rel="nofollow">Scenes without Goals &amp; Conflicts</a>, I was playing HB last night and realized there were some scenes that were aggressively framed for conflict, and then a conflict was resolved, but <em>without</em> an opportunity or need for dice rolling. Paraphrased:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Uncle: I insist that you reign in your Conscience attribute in service of your Blood attribute.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&gt;</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Player: You are presenting some hard choices.... but I will agree to this.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>(Some liberties taken with the above.)</p>
<p>This scene was fantastic and resolved a dramatic conflict that was occurring, but the HB rules by default suggest that this scene so far does not effect any of a player's ratings, and that a scene cannot end without a conflict of interest being resolved. What happened in play was that the scene continued, I found something else to push on, and we used the normal resolution mechanics to good effect.</p>
<p>However, here's what I think I'd like to do instead: in a scene that a player strongly addresses his passions, the GM may choose to end the scene even if the "conflict-of-interest" part has not yet occurred. Instead, the GM can offer the player a low passion check: roll 2d10, add the <em>lowest</em> number to your passion and rearrange your ratings to fit.</p>
<p>Any thoughts?</p>

                            I can't believe I missed this post. Sorry 'bout that.<br/><br/>In an earlier draft of HB, a player could call for a passion check even without entering into a conflict. Basically, whenever the player felt that his passion had been invoked, conflict or not, he could make it so. Your suggestion isn't too far off from that original rule. My only concern, though, would be that you could theoretically move through an entire episode without actually rolling any conflicts. At the very least it would certainly divorce passion from conflict to a certain extent.<br/><br/>I do sort of like how your variation gives the GM and player an out if a scene isn't strong enough for conflict, but maybe strong enough for meaningful development. I just wonder if players in that sort of situation shouldn't hold off until the scene really erupts.<br/><br/>I'm sort of left wondering, moreover... if there really wasn't a conflict, then why do you think it would be appropriate to roll a passion check? Put another way, if the character is really getting passionate about something, doesn't that mean that he's being forced to make a decision amongst his influences? And if so, then isn't there a conflict hiding in there somewhere, if only internally?<br/><br/>As a point of clarification, you don't necessarily *have* to have a conflict before ending a scene. I didn't mean to imply that in the rules. On the other hand, it's certainly preferable to have a conflict before taking away the spotlight from a particular character.                        </div>

<p>Hey Tim. So I did in fact work quite well when I tried it out. Here's an example of what happened: one player was trying to achieve a goal (secure some land) and I presented various obstacles to this situation. In each case, I was present a new complication and thus a new opportunity for direct conflict. "Oh no, the landlord is denying you... Now the merchant is outbidding you... Now your brother has struck a bad deal..." In each case, I offered the conflict, but the player's choice was to accept this situation and work around it in a political sense. She basically decided in each case to make a meaningful retreat and find a different tactic for pushing the situation.</p>
<p>Finally she found an angle to push: blackmailing the merchant. What happened is we came near the point of a "conflict", and then she narrated something (speaking in-character) powerful enough that it would have been extraneous to push for a roll after that point: I wanted a way to "give", in Dogs terms. So we closed the scene per normal, and I let her take an extra passion check "if she felt that she had pushed her passions further". Given the power of her narration, this was obviously true, so she took the roll. This worked just right.</p>
<p>Now, I see that I could have started the roll just a little bit before this: roll for the conflict, and then use that to determine how well her conflict goes and whether she should make that powerful statement. One part of the problem is that we frequently felt the stakes weren't clearly enough defined (in terms of what would happen when she won/lost) until we had already committed some things into the fiction. In this case, she made her powerful statement, and I felt that put an end to meaningful development of the conflict. In any case: this kind of negotiation didn't dominate the play, but just fit our style better.</p>
