The rules say they get to choose from 3options generated by the other players (difficult, dangerous or both) but doesn't this involve inventing a lot of content that gets left on the cutting room floor? (as the player will only trigger one of the options)<br/>Am I playing this right or did anyone else find this?<br/><br/>As a fix I've adopted the aw-style 2d6 roll with 6- being the "both" result ie failure, 7-9 being "dangerous" ie sucess with complications and 10+ being "difficult". A modifier of +1 for dangerous and +2 for dificut tasks.<br/>This is somthing like the sundered land but not as sophisticated.<br/>Anyway it provides a little less predictability and no need to generate ideas that don't end up in the fiction.                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_418272">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol" title="Epidiah_Ravachol"><img alt="Epidiah_Ravachol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Epidiah_Ravachol">Epidiah_Ravachol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418272/#Comment_418272" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T11:14:55+00:00" title="July 13, 2013 11:14AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've manage to re-reverse engineer it back to <i>Apocalypse World</i>!<br/><br/>I'd be interested in hearing what your experiences with this method are, but I have couple words of caution here:<br/><br/>The first is that Difficult is not necessarily the most desired result. Part of the fun of resolving a focused crewmember's scene is finding ways to make the non-obvious choice the better result. If what you need in order to get the ship's hyperdrive working is to feed it the heart of a loved one, you might super excited about taking the dangerous result instead.<br/><br/>The second is that it's the choice between these options that sets the focused crewmembers apart. A focus crewmember can choose to make a Dangerous task merely a Difficult one, and vice versa as the situation requires. This is a big leg up on the non-focus crewmembers who must immediately suffer the unmitigated consequences of their actions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_418277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/robb" title="robb"><img alt="robb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/robb">robb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/418277/#Comment_418277" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-13T13:08:47+00:00" title="July 13, 2013  1:08PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It works fine in my experience. The main advantage is that you only have to invent 1 thing to keep the story rolling, just like when a non-focus character acts. <br/>To be honest we didn't really use dice modifiers most of the time, having a 3-way possible branch in the story was sufficient. <br/><br/>Kids are loving the game BTW - well done!<br/><br/>I saw some AP on Judd K's page that suggested playing some flash-back scenes first to pin down issues identified in char gen, sounds good. <br/>Maybe you should put together a players guide that is longer than the rules? :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
