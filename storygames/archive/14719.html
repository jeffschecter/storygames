We had one new person (whose name I caught but apparently dropped somewhere along the way).  <br/><br/>I played Angela Kinsey (or maybe Angela Martin) as <b>Rachel Harper</b>, Self-Appointed Morality Enforcer and Complete Hypocrite (and thorn in Donald's side; Community: Social Adversaries) as well as HR director.  Nicknamed the "ice queen" (double meaning there) by NPC Steve (me).  <br/><br/>Tracey (Roddy Manic) played Jolene Blalock as <b>Randy Harper</b>, Rachel's ex-wife (Romance: former spouses), and Mac Station's newest (bad) cook.  We decided that Randy and Rachel had been together happily for nine years, gotten married in Iowa as soon as it was legal, and promptly divorced three months later.  <br/><br/>Our new guy played <b>Tom Petly</b>, the Commisar of the Commisary, and Randy's boss (Work: supervisor/worker)).  <br/><br/>Mike (stupidgremlin) played <b>Donald Mali-Mali</b>, the New Zealander postmaster of Mac Station (Location: post office in building 140), Tom's (mostly literal) partner-in-crime (Work: clandestine collaborations).  Rachel liked to poke her nose in on Donald's lucrative smuggling operation.  She never actually tried to close it down, just liked to poke her nose in and shake things up a bit.  <br/><br/>Rachel and Randy shared Need: To Get Laid, in exchange for something you need (which turned out to be a flask of some kind of licorice flavored liqueur that Randy was trying to retrieve for Donald).  <br/><br/>There was also an Object: Untoward: A secret shrine, which turned out to be Rachel's (who never actually got over Randy).  <br/><br/>We start with Rachel having to break up a squabble in the dining hall, which turned out to be between Tom the commissary manager and her ex-wife!  "What are you doing here?"  "...cooking sushi?"  "No, I mean here, in Antarctica!"  "...cooking sushi."  This was the last person she'd expected to see and the last place she'd expected to see her.  <br/><br/>At some point, Donald brought in the station commander, Vic (as played by R. Lee Ermey, apparently) to try to put the kibosh on Rachel.  Vic was under the impression that Rachel Harper and Randy Harper were sisters, and we're not sure we ever managed to disabuse him of the notion.  <br/><br/>Randy received the standard issue hazing (involving getting drunk and doing a 50 yard dash naked around the compound), which she took with good grace, making a friend (Steve, another assistant cook, from Brooklyn, NPC brought in by me).  "No kiddin', eh?  You was married to da ice queen?"  Steve later supplied her with the Vicodin she would use to bring Rachel down....<br/><br/>Donald tried to frame Rachel with a package from her mother, containing a flask.  Tracey was reading my mind (not the only incidence of this; see the secret shrine, above) when, upon seeing the package, Randy exclaimed "But her mother's been dead for ten years!"  Upon picking up her mail, promptly at 1300 ("Did you know your clock is five minutes fast?"), and reiterating the fact that her sainted mother had been dead for a long time, she opened the package, and "I'm confiscating this as evidence of smuggling."  <br/><br/>While plotting to retrieve the flask, Randy hinted that she might like to see Rachel that evening, alone.  Rachel immediately was on cloud nine, and planned a nice time together in her private quarters.  She wore a nice kimono and was taking nips off of the flask all evening.  Randy did show up, five minutes late as usual, but they had their date (Rachel: "This is really good! I love this flavor! It's licorice, I think... Here, have a sip! Hey, let's drink a toast.  To us!" etc.)<br/><br/>'Long about here came the Tilt, which I think came out rather anemic as Tilts go but effective nonetheless: Mayhem: misdirected passion, and Innocence: a neighbor wanders into the situation.  <br/><br/>After the love scene between Randy and Rachel (which we faded away from, end scene), Rachel had the munchies, so she wandered down to the commissary, all smiles.  Tom gave her the pie (fish and pumpkin plus Vicodin) Randy had prepared especially for her.  ("Vicodin always gives her a stomachache!" Randy had earlier noted).  Between the numerous nips off the flask Rachel had been taking all evening and the Vicodin in the pie, and her general light-weightedness due to inexperience and being 5'4" and all of 110 pounds soaking wet, it was barely a minute and a half before she was down.  <br/><br/>To cover everything up, Tom got the bright idea to set a fire in the commissary.  Realizing that he couldn't just leave Rachel to burn, he dragged her outside.  Unfortunately, most of the fire suppression equipment was either out of date (fire extinguishers) or completely useless (an old fire engine, the engine long stripped to sell to the Chinese station, which they had stripped down to use to make moonshine), so most of the compound ended up burning to the ground.  <br/><br/>Donald got on the horn to his Chinese contact to try to arrange an extraction for himself, Tom, and Randy, but his Chinese apparently wasn't that great because he gave them the wrong place for the rendezvous (the motor pool building, the only intact structure left at Mac Station).  When the Chinese delegation didn't show, Donald and Tom decided to eliminate the other witness, throwing Randy into the water (which she survived apparently due to special forces exposure training).  <br/><br/>The Aftermath:  We all ended up with 3 of one color and 1 of the other.  Donald and Tom ended up with black-7 and white-7 respectively, and Rachel and Randy ended up with black-10 and white-10 respectively.  We were a little short on time and getting shooed out, so we didn't play out the aftermath one die at a time, but we decided that the Chinese took Rachel (who apparently speaks Chinese quite flawlessly) and headed out, crossing paths with Randy and picking her up as well, and extracting them to civilization and a happily-ever-after (or at least for a while, I think).  I don't quite remember what happened to Donald and Tom, but they were apparently left behind at the burned out compound with only the motor pool building for shelter.  <br/><br/>This was the first Fiasco I played in where half the group didn't end up dead, maimed, imprisoned, institutionalized, etc.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334759/#Comment_334759" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-16T00:26:31+00:00" title="July 16, 2011 12:26AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This was pretty fun, though we probably would've gotten further if we didn't have to reroll everything when Tracey showed up late.<br/>I think the new guy (Keaton, maybe? I'm terrible with names) did pretty well, for his first real foray into indie gaming.<br/><br/>And just before anyone starts thinking that Tom Petly's behavior was somewhat erratic (burning down the commissary one minute, and saving Rachel from certain death the next), it was entirely because Randy's terrible cooking and culinary heresy drove him to drink rather heavily.<br/>Playing Donald was enjoyable, even though he didn't succeed in his plans. Darn those tonal languages! ...next time, I need to play a different kind of personality.

The only person to make it out alive, only did so infected. <br/><br/>Nothing beats my experience with Lucky Strike. <br/>It ended with half of the group (9 players) forming their own cannibalistic warlord state in ruins of a city destroyed during the war, where the elite got to eat their subjects. <br/><br/>Or All the Damn Time. <br/>Were played Sams life as a rock star, while simultaneously playing through scenes in biographical movie, and him trying to remember the subtle changes between the two. In the end we found that the love of his life that made is life so horrible and complicated, was actually himself after the sex change he went through for a part that he played in an earlier movie, who lost her/himself in the role. All of this, of course, was not revealed until after everyone worked together to try and kill her for all the horrible stuff that she did.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_334962">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin" title="Chris_Goodwin"><img alt="Chris_Goodwin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/104/nWRZN6AU4P4W8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Chris_Goodwin">Chris_Goodwin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334962/#Comment_334962" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-17T18:43:29+00:00" title="July 17, 2011  6:43PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 17, 2011 6:43PM by Chris_Goodwin.">edited July 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Ice reminds me in a lot of ways of M*A*S*H, and has given me the idea for a M*A*S*H themed playset.

Most tabletop gamers are used to slaying dragons or being vampires or being superheroes or flying spaceships or whatnot so they pick the thing that looks the most like the kind of escape they usually seek.  Then, of course, once they've played and they "get it," it's much easier to go to playsets with what they'd usually view as more "mundane" settings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
