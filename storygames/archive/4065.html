I've come up with my first game of real worth, and I just need to tweak it here and there.  My questions are in <b>bold.</b><br/><br/>The game is of the shoujo manga genre - and of the Magical Girl subgenre.  Well, sort of.  <br/><br/>The player's characters are all ordinary teenage schoolgirls or, rarely, schoolboys from Anytown, Japan, and all of you have just met a beautiful teenage girl - looks to be Chinese, from the hairstyle, the features of her face and her clothing - who works as a delivery girl at the cheapest and yet the best dim sum place in town.  Her name is Kwan Yin.<br/><br/>Otherwise known as the godess, Compassion Herself.<br/><br/>Yeah.  <i>That</i> Kwan Yin.<br/><br/>So you all become good friends - your PC, Kwan Yin, and through Kwan Yin, your PC and the other PC's.   <br/><br/>Kwan Yin then recruits you and empowers you all to destroy Hungry Ghosts.  My Hungry Ghosts are malevolent beings that cannot accept that they are dead.  They destroy good things by making people who love them obsess over them until the Ghost can eat everything good about it.<br/><br/>Your job is two-fold: help the people any Hungry Ghost is hurting and help all Hungry Ghosts move on.<br/><br/><b>Anything I can do to punch up this setup?</b><br/><br/>In the grand tradition of all Magical Girl stories, it has an over the top, symbolically charged name.  My game is called <i>Magical Psychopomp Lotus Guardians.</i>  Some name, eh?  <b>Is it too over the top or just right?</b><br/><br/>Rules to follow.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90757">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90757/#Comment_90757" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T14:08:20+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  2:08PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Do I get to play Kwan Yin?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_90759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser" title="Elliott Belser"><img alt="Elliott Belser" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elliott%20Belser">Elliott Belser</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90759/#Comment_90759" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T14:11:27+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  2:11PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You couldn't play <i>that particular</i> Kwan Yin.<br/><br/>You could play as <i>another incarnation</i> of Kwan Yin.<br/><br/>...I'm not entirely sure that I was joking.<br/><br/>In hindsight, I think <i>that's good.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_90781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/90781/#Comment_90781" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-08-27T15:07:14+00:00" title="August 27, 2007  3:07PM">August 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, so ...

She would be male and Indian if this was set in China.  (And would probably be the Buddha if this were set in India.  I digress.)<br/><br/>She appears to be a Chinese dim-sum delivery girl to give her relative social invisibility for a Chinese girl living and working in any-town, Japan.<br/><br/>She appears to be a beautiful, intelligent teenager to better be the best friend of her magical girls.  She really does care for them and want to be her friend, and "have not lost all thier innocence, but beginning to become wise" is part of the Psychopomp Guardian job description, so most of them are teenagers.<br/><br/>These are my reasons.

Has this kinda ring to it, I think.<br/><br/>Guan Yin generally wants the MPG's to deal with a problem <i>before</i> or <i>just as</i> it's starting to make the Magical Psychopomp Guardians lives a living hell.  If they don't deal with it, it will spill over onto their lives, and Guan Yin will wince and ask them if they're all right and totally not say "I told you so" (and that's not sarcasm, in fact) when reminding them to please deal with it, because in the long run, she wouldn't be Compassion Herself if she didn't let the Magical Psychopomp Guardians, who unlike most people can SEE when it's a Hungry Ghost, deal with it themselves.<br/><br/>If they ask Guan Yin for help, she will offer as much advice and moral support as she can.  (In fact, someone can call for the help of Guan Yin in game in order to take a break from - as the saying goes on Story Games - "So, does your brother or your boyfriend get kicked in the nuts?")<br/><br/>I was considering giving her this stat block (which would make her considered a Magical Psychopomp Guardian, btw) so she could offer more material aid.<br/><br/>Guan Yin, the goddess Compassion Herself<br/>Passions: 4<br/>- I want to be Compassion Herself.<br/>- I want to help those who can see Hungry Ghosts learn to give them rest.<br/>- I want to experience everything and travel to every shore.<br/>- I love my Prince and want to be his girl forever.<br/>Suffering: 001/108                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
