Our post-apocalyptic community inhabited a damaged airship in some demolished Final Fantasy esque world.  They had to contend with gyro-raiders, octosharks, toxic waters and other such threats from the world.  To further complicate things the population of mostly women (and few young people) was at odds with the all male "crew" (especially as the men started hoarding the technical manuals, damn you Chief Hard!) but the socialist/marxist/feminist reading group that arose to counter that influence created a lot of fun drama.  Next time we play we plan to keep a closer eye on the "dispassionate" portion of the rules but we really had a blast (and a few of our group are a hard sell on "these" types games).  <br/><br/>Our Map: <img alt="image" src="http://i51.tinypic.com/2cdalo2.jpg"/><br/><br/>Share &amp; Enjoy.                  </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_407508">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phronesis" title="phronesis"><img alt="phronesis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phronesis">phronesis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407508/#Comment_407508" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-02-27T14:31:18+00:00" title="February 27, 2013  2:31PM">February 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, new to the forum, hope this is the right place to post, please correct me if not.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_407813">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Larry" title="Larry"><img alt="Larry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Larry">Larry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/407813/#Comment_407813" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-02T15:18:43+00:00" title="March  2, 2013  3:18PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You used d10s?

We could have gone a little more balls to the wall and I think it would have been more exciting.  This is not to say we didn\u2019t have a blast but when we discussed the game afterwards we came away with the general conclusion we would be a little more vigilant in our distance when appropriate the next time we play.  I largely chock it up  to the fact we were learning a new game though (Note: There is a strong \u201ctraditionalist\u201d strain to our group and we\u2019ve been gaming together since elementary school so certain understandable habits are set in- I\u2019ll tell you about my disastrous Poison\u2019d game I ran at some point Joe over a beer or something at the next con we bump into each other at.) <br/><br/>On the project dice front, we stuck to 1-6 projects basically (though I think for one we started to wrangle and just made it a 7 weeker but it was at towards the end of the game so kind of moot anyway).  My main reason I brought the 10's is that my swanky little jade dwarvenstones normally only get broken out when we play L5R.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_408182">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phronesis" title="phronesis"><img alt="phronesis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phronesis">phronesis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/408182/#Comment_408182" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-03-05T15:45:25+00:00" title="March  5, 2013  3:45PM">March 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, on the point of what I felt we got right, the obstacles felt real and were at times both surprising and fun (at one point some industrious members of the reading group  smuggled a few octosharks on board the ship to breed/control as part of a planned coup- that was a fun project but alas it was not meant to be.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
