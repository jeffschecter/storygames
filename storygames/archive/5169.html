He brings up some really interesting points about the game design.  Stuff that's almost certainly going to affect the next iteration of the RBH rules.  So I wanted to share this with everyone who's interested in the game.\n<blockquote>Hi<br/><br/>I played a game of this last night with a pick up group at a house con. <br/>Overall, we had a blast.<br/><br/>Character generation was a highlight, with everyone enjoying the classes <br/>and talent picks. We then had a small changeover as a pre-planned game <br/>began, and two players left, passing their characters to other people. <br/>Both characters appealed to the new players, luckily, so that was fine.<br/><br/>We had time to go through about half the dungeon I had planned - this <br/>involved the 'find out stuff in town' scenes, getting there, fighting a <br/>monster that was hunting from the dungeon, and then taking out a goblin <br/>tribe in the old temple.<br/><br/>The first fight was with a tough wolf-beast, and the four characters <br/>only just survived (two were taken out). This was partly that I made it <br/>too tough (four powers, I think, and high stats), and partly that one <br/>particular power seemed overpowered. That was 'Frenzied', which I would <br/>suggest ought to be just a single token gain each hit. However, a burst <br/>of cunning tactics by the remaining two players had them defeat it okay. <br/>Note that I also broke the rules on this guy, giving it heavy weapons <br/>when it's size was 0 - however, I could have simply allocated size up <br/>and had the same issue, although it would have been worth a few more XP.<br/><br/>Then they scouted out the old temple, got spotted by goblin guards. The <br/>scouting pcs took out the (mook) guards, then there was a big battle <br/>versus the goblin warlord (monster) with 12 mook goblins. He had the <br/>minions and free showoff on a hit powers, that worked well. Everyone <br/>thought the minions one was very cool. This guy also had the first <br/>treasure they were after.<br/><br/>Then the sneaky snake character got into the goblin area and scouted it <br/>out inside, and another battle began to take out the goblin shaman <br/>(monster). The shaman had the stun power, and this was another close <br/>fought battle, with people still down hp after the first one. They won, <br/>and everyone levelled up.<br/><br/>That brought us to the end of our time, so we finished up there (leaving <br/>the dragon priest cult untouched in the lower levels, maybe they'll get <br/>theirs another time).<br/><br/>We discussed what worked, and everyone liked the simple system and <br/>combat, and the fact there were a few tactical options in there. I feel <br/>that Daring might be too central a stat, and that show off rolls might <br/>be better being based on something else (eloquence or a new stat <br/>maybe?). One character rolled very low daring (0 or -1) and he found <br/>this a bit of a problem (although his effectiveness wasn't hugely affected).<br/><br/>Balancing encounters info: for 4 level 1 characters, one or two powers <br/>per monster seemed about right. The monster with more was too much for <br/>them (although that was their first fight, so rules knowledge may have <br/>helped). I used 12 and then 10 minions with the other monsters, which <br/>was on the tough side of balanced.<br/><br/>I also think there should be rules for getting magic items for your <br/>characters, too. Maybe allocated to an adventure in the same way <br/>treasures are?<br/><br/>The injury rules need to be loosened, I think. Because of the limited <br/>number of hp, it means that a lot of fights are going to require the <br/>party to withdraw and heal. Maybe the long term healing should be just <br/>for 1 or 0 hp results? You might also want to add more healing talents, <br/>maybe to the Mystic, or a first aid roll that can try and skip the days <br/>of healing options.<br/><br/>Seems like the system is basically solid, though. I think it really just <br/>needs the GM planning section sorted out. Some random tables would <br/>probably be a really nice addition, to allow adventures and monsters to <br/>be quickly thrown together.<br/><br/>For me, it had a lot of the cool tactical feel of Agon, but with the <br/>emphasis on teamwork instead of individual glory, and a more <br/>light-hearted attitude. Great stuff.<br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Mike </blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116726">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116726/#Comment_116726" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T21:58:11+00:00" title="December 27, 2007  9:58PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Mike, first I want to thank you for a really excellent actual play report.  I'm extra-smiley that you and everyone who played it enjoyed it.  That means a lot to me.</p>\n<p>Now on to your concerns.</p>\n<p><strong>The Wolf-Beast Fight and monster-balancing</strong><br/>\nI think the real issue here is that you and I have somewhat different expectations about how an average fight should turn out.  See, two characters down and two characters up is exactly what I expected to come out of a balanced fight.  And you say that it took some cunning tactics on the part of the players that finished off the beast?  Perfect!  I honestly couldn't ask for more.  That is really <em>exactly</em> how I'd hoped the system would work.</p>\n<p>Although I am sorry that you didn't care for how it worked.  Perhaps in the next iteration of the rules I should spend some more space talking about what the players and the GM can expect from the system.  I'll keep it in mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Monster power scaling</strong><br/>\nJust how badly did Frenzy seem out of whack?  I ask because I'm cool with the monsters powers not all being on the same power level.  At the same time, I don't want any of the powers to be so weak as to be useless or so powerful as to be, you know, <em>UBER</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Daring is too central</strong><br/>\nYou're not the first one to say that.  In fact, I think Andy K said something to that effect after the last time we played.  Problem is, I'm just not seeing it.  I think I need to have someone run the game for me so I can run a character with a -1 Daring and see what I can do with it.</p>\n<p>In fact, if there are any other potential RBH playtesters out there, I'd like to ask you to try on the low-Daring characters for size and see what happens.</p>\n<p>Honestly I thought <em>Size</em> was going to be the over-emphasized attribute.  I'm really surprised.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Items</strong><br/>\nI'm wary of magic items.  I've had more than one D&amp;D game turn to poo on account of escallating magic items.  The first iteration of the RBH rules talked briefly about including them.  I'll probably include them again.  Right after I figure out how to regulate them in a way that makes me happy.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing</strong><br/>\nLike with the monster balancing thing, I think what we're looking at here is just a matter of differing expectations.  I mean, why can't the PCs take a couple days off from fighting and chill in the dungeon a bit?  Have a scene or two where the time passes, the character share food and wine, and Sir KillMuchlee recovers from being chewed on.  It's not very D&amp;Dish to let the adventurers have a couple day's worth of peace and quiet in a dungeon without some wandering monster showing up to screw with them, but that's the kind of thing I was looking for.</p>\n<p><strong>The GM Section</strong><br/>\nYeah.  No doubt.  This section is completely weak.  It's <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> on my list for things to improve in the next version of the rules.  I just need to run the thing a few more times before I'll really be able to write up anything reliable.</p>\n<p>I know that none of that was probably what you were looking for.  You say "flaw" and I scream back "FEATURE!!!"  But I promise you that your concerns will be in my head when I'm playing this thing next time.  I'll be paying particular attention to the uses of Daring compared to all the other attributes and how badly I beat up the PCs with Frenzied monsters.  The stuff that I disagree with my playtesters on is the stuff that sticks with me the most.  Either I'll prove it to myself that I was right, or I'll find a way to fix it.</p>\n<p>Again, thank you for your AP report.  I love it that folks are playing this thing.</p>\n<p>Eric</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_116727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder" title="Matt Snyder"><img alt="Matt Snyder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matt%20Snyder">Matt Snyder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116727/#Comment_116727" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-27T22:05:28+00:00" title="December 27, 2007 10:05PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What the heck is the Redbox Hack?

I still think that the downtime should be reduced, afterwards (but the suggestion of just doing it with a 'time passes' montage is good enough, really).<br/><br/>Frenzied was way overpowered - the beast had maybe 8 tokens at the end - basically enough that if it got a hit at someone they'd be out. If the gain was a single token, it would still be a good power but not quite so all or nothing. So, in our case it did come out uber-tough. The only thing that saved the others was that I said it couldn't climb trees so they just stayed up there and shot at it (I gave it a chance to knock them down as a push move, but they got lucky).<br/><br/>Re: Magic items<br/><br/>Yeah, they'd have to be controlled to prevent escalation getting out of hand... how about limiting magic item bonuses to character level or something? So if they pick up the new +2 widget of dancing they need to throw away their old +1 pants of doom or whatever? Alternatively, allow one magic item per dungeon per character, but have all magic items give a flat +1 bonus (so that the character retires before they get uber-powerful).<br/><br/>And, like I said, everyone had a good time even though everyone was basically thrown into it (in the house-con "well who has something to play" kind of way). It seems 90% solid to me (with 2% rules tweaks and 8% more gm advice required to finish it up).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116770/#Comment_116770" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-28T06:43:06+00:00" title="December 28, 2007  6:43AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>Cool, man.
