This leads to a nice diversity in the <a href="http://www.odyssee-con.de/Spielrunden" rel="nofollow">program</a>. And I want to contribute to that program.<br/><br/>So, looking to my book shelf, all these great independent, unconventional, or seldomly played games, I find myself in a strange situation. I love these games and how they changed the way of role-playing. I love to play them as a player. I'd love to have more people playing them. However, I cannot get myself up and read them again to prepare myself for the convention.<br/><br/>However, I see the covers and get stories in my head for each of these wonderful settings. My lazyness is about the game mechanics - I'm just not keen to figure them out.<br/><br/>I'm afraid that I'm spoiled by the year-long experience of playing with inspiration cards. It started with Engel and its Arkana system. We were young and innocent and enjoyed this easy way of having fun, so we built a Arkana deck for Mage, for Werewolf, even for Shadowrun. Lately I'm just using the Everway tarot for almost everything (though it works best on fantasy influenced settings).<br/><br/>It's so easy: it does everything I need to run a thrilling story. I use it for campaign and adventure planning, for character creation, for group concept development, for conflict resolution, to add surprise and thrill, and to end <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7069" rel="nofollow">boring situations</a>.<br/>Having this tool, I somehow lost the energy to dig in any other systems, at least as a GM. If I can play our story with this, why study new game mechanics?<br/><br/>So, what I really would like to do: play Dogs in the Vineyard, Breaking The Ice, Covenant, Sorcerer, Blue Planet, Nobilis, Blue Rose (just to name a few) -- without the system. Just the setting and the way the story goes.<br/><br/>And of course be honest to the players ("this is just a setting demo -- the game has wonderful game mechanics, with these nice ideas in it, and if you like the setting and want to know more about the system: buy it!")<br/><br/>But: isn't that lame? Cheating? Of any help to the community?<br/><br/><br/>\tDaniela                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158313/#Comment_158313" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T06:39:37+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  6:39AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If you've found a method of play that works really well for you, stealing settings is a time-honored tradition.

In my experience, Arkana/Everway/Tarot based systems work best with people you've played more than a few games with before.  That kind of familiarity and comfort can be harder to come by with the random slew of people who sign up for convention games.<br/><br/>But, yeah, certainly not "lame" or "cheating."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniela" title="Daniela"><img alt="Daniela" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniela">Daniela</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158339/#Comment_158339" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T07:41:01+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  7:41AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all your comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason: definitely, it's another experience, and being honest would - of course! - cover the announcement sheet. So people should know before going to that group that they will not experience the game system.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham: speaking of numbers, I think that Dogs has three major contributions: the setting (and the way it is explained to the busy GM - brilliant!), the system (which I played and GMed before), and the adventure building recipe (building towns) based on sin progression. So by not using the system, I'd say I loose one third of the experience, not the majority :-) -- which is maybe the most innovative part.<br/>\nBy the way, the building town strategy is perfectly transferrable to other settings (I've run some workshops on that).<br/>\n<br/>\nJonathan: that is my least concern, and not part of my experience. I've run multiple beginner rounds with Engel. Also, I tend to do hybrid sessions if I know the game system well enough. So it's up to the player whether to take a card or to roll the dice. The majority of players skips the dice quickly.<br/>\nAlso, I get tend to get the curious folk who want to try out something they don't know, not the worst bunch of players you could get at a convention.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nRe-thinking the issue, I agree that some games deserve more then just stealing the setting. Others deserve to revive the setting, without their crumpy systems going in the way. Maybe I just should focus on the last bunch and leave the Indie demos to someone with more time and love for systems.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shreyas" title="shreyas"><img alt="shreyas" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://twoscooters.wordpress.com/files/2008/02/rj.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shreyas">shreyas</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158362/#Comment_158362" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T08:35:08+00:00" title="July 24, 2008  8:35AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>If your intention is to expose new games to the community, and the setting isn't <em>integral</em> to those games, then I think that running them without their mechanics fails at your stated goal.

There are lots of games which I could demo that would work for all three intentions.<br/>\nMaybe I'll compromise. Find the time for one 'real' demo (setting and system) and do the easy-fun way with some others.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham: yes, extracting the setting building stuff out of the games is a good idea. I also love the character creation process of Reign. So I could demo this, and then have a fun story with the created PCs (and no dice). And yes, numbers on a sheet help in playing diceless, even if you don't use them directly in your conflict resolution system.<br/>\n<br/>\nJust a remark: we do a regular "this is the role-playing hobby" booth at a board-game fair (which is combined with a computer and eletronics fair, a model trains and model ships fair, and a handcraft fair). When we persuade people who never did a rpg before to try a demo, setting comes first. If they don't like the setting, they are typically not interested to learn about the game mechanics. Of course, the game mechanics we want to demo are much more basic ("Look. This is a character sheet. ..."). <br/>\n<br/>\nSo, there could be players who are consider setting more important than system, and would by a game only on a setting demo.<br/>\n<br/>\nHa, and the last group of buyers could be those who didn't like the diceless system at all and want to know the "real thing".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158384/#Comment_158384" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-24T10:25:25+00:00" title="July 24, 2008 10:25AM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Daniela,<br/><br/>Your "using Dogs town creation in other settings" sounds really interesting.

So should any of the people you play with, decide to pick up the game itself.. they might be a little confused as to why their gaming experience back home doesn't remotely match up to the "awesome game" at the convention. They might look to the game to make them come up with the fiction, that they've come up with on their own before. And get frustrated that it's not really helping them as much as they thought it would. I'd suggest, instead of swapping the entirety of the rules with a set of rules you're comfortable with, why not just run a stripped-down, simplified version of the original game? (After all, it's not like you'd present the entirety of the game's setting in a single session, either.)<br/><br/>If you like the escalation-mechanics in DitV pick those and drop the raise-see mechanic, if that's giving you trouble. Maybe you really enjoy the Kicker-Bang-techniques but cannot figure out how to deal with dice-rolls in Sorcerer (especially since <i>Play Sorcerer</i> isn't out yet <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> ). Pick the bits and pieces you like and let the fiction lead your gaming otherwise. <br/><br/>This way your players will get a taste of the game itself, without worrying about rules minutiae or design constructs. But really, it's your game after all. Just have fun playing the game. Don't worry about presentations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_158703">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158703/#Comment_158703" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-25T18:08:14+00:00" title="July 25, 2008  6:08PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Daniela</cite>Callan, yes -- I'd consider it unfair to take parts of a game and not telling people where I got it from (YMMV).<br/>*snip*<br/>But, if the setting is somehow unique, and I want to emphasize this uniqueness (e.g., Blue Planet), people should know where they could read more, if they liked the game.</blockquote>\nIn terms of your question about what is cheating/lame and what I consider cheating/lame, couldn't you just tell them what game you grabbed it from, after the session has ended? I see a certain dishonesty in bringing up blue planet at the start or during the game, when really it's just your own concoction. But here's a disclaimer: Some groups use creative denial, where they run star trek or blue planet in a way no other group does, but they deny that and tell themselves they are playing it exactly as it should be. I think that's fine when at a certain level they all understand they are making stuff up. I can pull out some Ron Edwards quotes on it, if more details are needed.<br/><br/>If your going for creative denial, are you going to make sure everyone understands that? If not, I think it's just lying to bring up blue planet before the game - you can't be sure everyone knows their just pretending to play it. Some people might actually think they are playing it, and that'd be a flat out lie. Not a big moral outrage lie, but if you don't check everyones on board with the denial, then your essentially don't care if some people are being completely fooled into thinking their playing the actual game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_158881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniela" title="Daniela"><img alt="Daniela" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniela">Daniela</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/158881/#Comment_158881" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-07-27T13:48:46+00:00" title="July 27, 2008  1:48PM">July 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan: I'd love to read those quotes!<br/><br/>I'm just wondering - do we ever play a game exactly like another group?

I've played chess the same way millions of others have. But then you might say "But roleplay isn't like board games" which is shifting the goalposts of the word 'game' in your question. Then I make a post that calls you on that but it seems like I'm saying your being shifty and it is harsh on your playstyle. And we go on like that for several posts and it gets ugly and trails off into bitterness. Or atleast that's how it usually goes on the interwebs.<br/><br/>Just hypothetically, lets say there is no reason for the board games known as RPG's to be about creativity and there is nothing to stop them being played uniformly between groups, like chess is played uniformly between groups. There's no physical reason at all for creativity, except that one might decide to change the rules simply out of choosing to do so.<br/><br/>Would that kill roleplay for you? That there's no reason for creativity in roleplay, except for whimsy?<br/><br/>IF it would kill play for you, and if the hypothetical were the actual truth of the matter, how can I have a discussion with you without killing roleplay for you? Or without seeming like the bad guy for saying all your hard reasons for creativity are merely perpetuated misstruths/lies*?<br/><br/>I present this to show how it'd be more complicated than it looks. If the hypothetical were true, that is.<br/><br/>And now some Ron quotes,\n<blockquote>A great deal of the aesthetic power of Simulationist play, as I see it (and I mean that literally), lies in (a) adding to or developing that package, and (b) enjoying its resiliency against potential violation.</blockquote>\nHere's an important quote\n<blockquote>An easy example: if my role-playing group wants to "play Star Trek," it is very likely not to be consistent with or even compatible with your role-playing group's "play of Star Trek." Yet for historical Simulationist play, both of our groups are using our interpretations as "Bibles" for play. That's the denial, right there, and as I said, it's constructive - it serves an aesthetic purpose.</blockquote>\nHere's a direct link to Ron's post<br/><a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17334.msg188019#msg188019" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=17334.msg188019#msg188019</a><br/><br/>* I'm rereading my post and I know the word 'lie' is harsh, but I'm using it as a reality check. Let me put it this way - a fancy dress party is a 'lie', in that people aren't what they are dressed as. It's a fun lie. However, if the reality check starts to degrade and people were to think they are what they are dressed as...then it's not a fun lie anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_160430">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniela" title="Daniela"><img alt="Daniela" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniela">Daniela</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160430/#Comment_160430" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T06:52:24+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  6:52AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Callan, thanks for your comments and the link to Ron posts (I found now the time to read it). Interesting discussion. However, I think it is more about setting than about the game mechanics, but YMMV.<br/><br/>Just to clarify my terms:<br/> - "game mechanics / system" is the rule system<br/> - "setting" is the universe in which the story happens<br/> - "role play" is creative act that happens at the table when applying the rules (a little bit vague, since it includes a lot of different experiences like the story that is created, the experience of the characters for themselfes or the interaction between them, but for this discussion, it should work to sum them up).<br/> - "game experience" is what the player gets when all comes together<br/><br/>And yes, game mechanics and setting have a huge influence on the role play and the overall game experience. But other factors come from the social, temporal, spatial or media context in which we play. This is why we cannot repeat game experiences. We might get pretty similar experiences by using the same system in the same setting with the same number of players of similar player types over the same medium.<br/><br/>Chess has the same game mechanics all over the world. For the game experience, setting and roleplay are typically not relevant (minor exceptions: there are themed chess boards, and some players might imaging themselves to be warlords while playing it). And the number of players is fixed to two, which leads to only 1:1 interaction. For Chess lovers, the social context might also be not relevant, because the game can be reduced to moving your chessmen and still is fun (however, there might be Casual Gamers in Chess also who consider the social factor most importantt). So, the game experience of Chess is easier to reproduce. <br/><br/>To answer your question: I don't think that using the same game mechanics uniformly in all groups would kill roleplay (assuming that the rule system itself does not do it). By the way, having so many different rule systems around is annoying quite annoying if you are more interested in the role play part - learn new rules at every second table. <br/><br/>I also agree that things are more complicated than they look.  (They typically are :-))<br/><br/>OK, next attempt for clarification:<br/><br/>The overall game experience at the table is composed by many factors. Some are written in the rpg books, some are not. And for the buying decision (except for factors like 'nice cover' and 'starts with a letter with which I don't have a rpg book yet'), it could be a relevant factor, how much of the written things I need to recreate an enjoyable game experience.<br/><br/>So, back to the original questions: offering demo plays at conventions. The offer typically includes a combination of a game and a setting. Thinking about the "clients" of these offerings, what do players want?<br/><br/>If I think of myself, I have several questions in mind:<br/><br/>If I do not know the setting before:<br/> - Do I like the setting? <br/> - Would I / my group come up with interesting stories in this setting?<br/> - Could I use this setting in my campaign? (e.g., by time travel / planet hopping / ...)<br/><br/>I do not know the game mechanics / system before:<br/> - Does the system work for me? <br/> - Would the system work for my regular group? <br/> - Could I convert my current campaign to that system?<br/><br/>If I know both (typically not the case in demo plays, but as GM of a demo, you get those players), questions are different:<br/> - before play: great, I get the chance to play game X again! Can I re-use my beloved old X character?<br/> - in play: how does the GM handle this game? Can I learn something for my regular group? <br/> - If playing an existing character: do I like the way this game changes her?<br/> <br/>So, by offering a demo setting, players could find answers for the first three questions.<br/>Of course they could also judge the system I use, but by telling them that it is not the system which is bundled with the setting in this book, they should know that they don't get answers to the second three questions.<br/><br/>And for the players who know the game and want to play their existing character, it depends - if the changes on the character are just on the roleplay side, it should work by converting the characters description to the new system. If they are direct influences by the system on the character description (like in Dogs), it is more tricky and maybe not possible.<br/><br/><br/>So, after the discussion so far, I'd answer my original questions like this: yes, just setting demos are lame for people who want to learn about the whole game experience. However, it still might be useful for people that are interested in the setting, but not the system, because they convert everything worth playing to their favorite general system anyway.<br/><br/>Since this group might be not to large, I decided for that given convention, to offer Polaris (original rules), Engel (original rules) and Pendragon (with Everway/Arkana rules). The first two have both an innovative setting /and/ a system that influences the game experience a lot. <br/><br/>And the Pendragon play is not meant to be a demo at all. It neither uses the rule system from the Chaosium game, nor a typical Arthurian story (a criminal story in Aquae Sulis (Bath), a city that tries to keep their Roman culture even if the Empire on the continent is shattered). However, I called it Pendragon, because I want to invite players with existing Pendragon characters for that play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_160512">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S" title="Callan_S"><img alt="Callan_S" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Callan_S">Callan_S</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/160512/#Comment_160512" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-03T18:47:30+00:00" title="August  3, 2008  6:47PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Daniela,<br/><br/>It's shifted from <i>asking </i>if roleplay is a creative act, to <i>defining </i>it as a creative act. In terms of the posts subject, you can't ask someone if it's a creative act and then when they say it isn't, define it as creative - that means the question was just a sham and really you just wanted one answer (that answer being: It is creative).<br/><br/>It's a difficult subject. Constructive denial, as I undestand it, wants creativity, but also wants to pretend it didn't create anything - as if the group is playing the game as its meant to be played. How do you A: communicate you want it to be creative, but then B: everyone lets themselves forget that they are being creative in play, and C: all in the short space of time you have at a con, I do not know. It's hard, but I think that just because its hard doesn't mean any short cuts should be taken in terms of accurate information. I wont go on, because I haven't added much except to say all those goals together are hard to achieve <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
