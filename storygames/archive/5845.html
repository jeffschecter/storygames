He sent me the text that he had boiled up a couple of weeks back and I was finally able to clear some time in the busy Tuesday Night Gaming queue and fit in two to three sessions of MY.  Tonight was our first session of gameplay, with me as the Authority, and I figured I'd put up some notes on the game.  <br/><br/>For those that haven't heard much about Misspent Youth, the situation is that the PCs are all young rebels in a sci-fi future ruled by some figure of Authority.  The rebels gather together, friends to the end, and fight for what they believe in.  All in all, a kick-ass situation to be dropped in to.  <br/><br/>I'm not exactly the best at writing Actual Play.  I tend to describe how the play went down at the table because it helps me gather my thoughts and puts things into a context.  After that, that's when I'll discuss what I liked and didn't about the system, what I thought needs a little attention, that sort of stuff.  Enough about my modus operandi, let's get down to the play-by-play.<br/><br/>My play group, consisting of Zoe, Kevin, Camden, and myself sat down at around 8.30 pm for our regular Tuesday night happening.  I'd hit them all with the pitch a couple of weeks ago and everyone seemed excited to play.  After a couple of minutes of chatting about the type of game MY is, the influences on it, that sort of stuff, we went right in to the game setup.  <br/><br/>The first part of creating the game setup was designing the Authority.  Basically, the Players design the kind of world that they're going to have their characters in, as well as the sorts of bad guys that I'll be portraying.  I described it as "You guys are making up my character for me" and that got a big grin of coolness out of Zoe.  <br/><br/>I started off with the three "V"s of the Authority; Vice, Visage, and Victim.  Camden was in a bit of a violent mood and had originally requested that the Vice be "Fear" because he wanted something to fight against that was black-and-white in nature.  We wound up talking for a couple of minutes and he said that he imagined the Authority something that created a docile public through fear.  That's when I perked up and said "Well, what the Authority really, really wants is control, isn't it?  Why not make the Vice "Stability"?"  People dug on that quickly and we moved along at a good pace, settling on a religious organization that wanted Stability and destroyed History.  We reasoned that the Authority wanted to destroy parts of history that lead people to believe they could exist without the help of the Authority.  The phrase "History is written by the winners" was used at the table.   <br/><br/>Next up we went in to creating the Motifs of the game.  These are the sci-fi tropes that add colour and coolness to our created setting.  Think of something half way between Minutae and Shocks in Shock: and you've got it right.  I told the players, "Alright, you've got to pick three right now.  We can make more as we play more, so jeach of you just pick one that you think will have the most impact on the game."  They each through in some pretty cool ones, leaving us with a game world that used brainwashing to keep people from becoming too rebellious, "reincarnation tubes" to rebirth people after their deaths, and a religious state that had control of most of the technology in the world.  <br/><br/>We went into rating the game next.  Just like the MPAA does, you rate your game depending on the amount of cursing, sex, and violence you imagined the game having.  I was actually hoping for something PG-13, but the players all settled on a hard-R rating and that was that.  We then followed that up with choosing the themes for the game.  Themes are just what you'd expect; thematic elements that will be recurring in the game.  It took a couple of minutes to describe these to the players so that they got it.  They thought that they were not just selecting Themes, but also choosing exactly how they were to be implemented in the game.  After clarifying a little bit that they were just picking some themes that they wanted to see in game, basically just saying "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if (this) were in the game alot?" they caught on.  We got to select three, and the play group went with "Sex", "Violence", and "Uniformity".  A good selection I believe.  <br/><br/>All in all I was impressed with this part of the setup.  As the Authority it is integral that you keep the Players on point.  My play group really likes to meander here and there, running around with an idea until it is buried well deep into the earth.  Misspent Youth suffers for that kind of play, it seems.  You really need to just keep people focused on the question at hand, get a consensus, then move on to the next item.  <br/><br/>The "Description" section of Authority creation is one of the first presented, but it really feels like it should be the last thing you do.  You see, you can't really define any one part of the Authority until you've selected all of its parts.  I couldn't see our play group having a grasp for what the Authority was truly like until all of the pieces had fallen into place.  Once that's done, then you can get into some more details, and those details just flowed out.  What we wound up with was The Penitent.\n<blockquote><b>The Penitent</b><br/>A religious order that is currently attempting to exert total control of the inhabitants of the City, an expansive futuristic/throwback city that is home to millions and millions of people.  No one knows if there are any people alive outside of the city.  The Penitent control all of the high technology in the City, calling it their "Blessings" and gifting those blessings on to the loyal.  Through the use of extensive and subtle brainwashing, the Penitent have been able to remove most knowledge of the world outside and the time before the Penitent existed from the populace.  <br/>Vice - Stability, Visage - Religious, Victim - History<br/>Need: for the populace to fall into line and support the Penitent.  <br/>Motifs: <br/>  1. Brainwashing to destroy memory of historical events.<br/>  2. "Resurrection Tubes" create clones that further the human race, a population dying off due to an increase in sterility.  <br/>  3. All advanced technology is owned and controlled by the Penitent.  <br/>Themes: Sex, Violence, Uniformity</blockquote>\nNext up...

You work out a common goal for the group, the kinds of characters that would be a part of it, that sort of stuff.  We rolled right into this part of the setup and, since the players knew what the Authority was like, it was pretty easy for them to figure out who they wanted to be.  <br/><br/>The first thing we did was come up with inspiration for the Clique.  What were they after?  Someone, it might have been me I must confess, uttered the phrase "Action Historians".  That's all we needed.  These were kids that were trying to rediscover and share the history that has been lost because of the actions of the Penitent.  That's a whole gallon of cool, right there.  I asked for some more details; specifically if they were just looking for knowledge, or if they were also looking for artifacts of the lost ages.  A quick discussion revealed that the players wanted to get the antiquities because they might be able to used them as further proof of what has gone before.  <br/><br/>Next up, I asked the players to come up with five or six ideas of the kinds of characters they would like to see in their Clique.  I've got to tell you, I love this step.  There's always at least that one player in every group that I play in that just freezes up a little bit when it comes to coming up with character concepts.  This takes the pressure off of them and just lets them talk about cool ideas.  Love it.  <br/><br/>I asked the players to try and include just a tiny little glimmer of personality with each concept the presented.  Something that gave them a little "grab".  These are the five character ideas that the group came up with.    <br/><br/>  - A traitor to the Penitent.  <br/>  - A "fighter-type" character with Blessed cybernetic implants.  <br/>  - A hacker too curious for their own good.  <br/>  - A person reborn from a Resurrection Tube that gets the occasional flashback from their previous lives.  <br/>  - The brilliant child of a powerful merchant.  <br/><br/>Once the ideas were laid down, I told the players to each hop on their favourite idea and that would be their character.  Camden went with the Merchant's Child, Kevin took the Flashback Case, and Zoe grabbed up the Curious Hacker.  <br/><br/>With concepts firmly bolted down, we went into individual character creation.  Here we all talked about the characters, how old they were, stuff like that.  I told the players it was important to talk about each decision they make, including the name they give their character, because that can help inform the world they're playing in.  Rob also uses the "Rule of Three" when it comes to character descriptions, asking the player to describe three details of their character.  <br/><br/>I'll present the complete characters a little later on.  I feel like I should move on through each step and talk about the questions that came up at each.  <br/><br/>The next step was choosing the characters' Traits.  Each character gets three "closed" traits and two "open" ones.  The closed traits each define the way in which your character was raised and have to be selected from a list.  Each of the closed traits has a regular and "sold out" version.  Your character starts with the regular version of his trait but can elect to "sell out" that part of himself in order to keep fighting on in a conflict.  <br/><br/>The players listened to the lists of traits and asked a couple of questions, mostly about what some of the Traits meant individually.  What was "Fostered" about?  What was the difference between "Smart" and "Cool"?  (Man, leave it to a gamer to ask that question.)<br/><br/>With the closed Traits selected we moved on to the open Traits.  These are Traits that are created by the player and define their role within the Clique, as well as a personal flaw thy have.  While they can be sold out, they don't have an inherent "opposite".  <br/><br/>When creating the Open Traits, I found that I had to have a steady hand in helping the players along.  I encouraged them to make their role-defining Trait, or Schtick, a Trait that was flexible and could be used in multiple ways.  I helped the players out with phrasing their Schticks just right.  I had to do the same with their Glitches, the PCs heroic fault.  I also had to point out a couple of times that the Glitch was something that was "heroic" in nature and wouldn't just cripple them; it made them act in interesting and heroic ways.  It was also important to tell the players that the Glitches were meant to be innocent or child-like.  <br/><br/>By the time we were done, we had come up with the following three characters...\n<blockquote> Yasov, the child of privilege (17 years old, male, played by Camden)<br/>  Tall, bald, and Dapper<br/>  Mistreatment: Sheltered (Dependent)<br/>  Motivation: Altruism (Manipulative)<br/>  Means: Cool (Trendy)<br/>  Schtick: Unflinching<br/>  Glitch: Self-sacrificing</blockquote>\n<blockquote> Uhry, the one that remembers (15 year old male, played by Kevin)<br/>  Short Brown Hair, Well-built, and the Paragon of Uniformity<br/>  Mistreatment: Neglected (Misanthropic)<br/>  Motivation: Pride (Arrogance)<br/>  Means: Bad (Perverse)<br/>  Schtick: 1000 Years of Dreams! (note: apparently a quote from the video game Lost Odyssey)  <br/>  Glitch: Adores Uniqueness  </blockquote>\n<blockquote> Jenny, the curious blasphemer (14 year old female, played by Zoe)<br/>  Mousy, Short, and Wears Glasses<br/>  Mistreatment: Fostered (Cold)<br/>  Motivation: Optimism (Cynic)<br/>  Means: Smart (Pedantic)<br/>  Schtick: Sixth Sense<br/>  Glitch: Hope Beyond Reason  </blockquote>\nI really enjoy this part of setup.  Character creation is made very simple by front-loading the concept stuff and sharing the burden over the whole play group.  Also, decisions made about the characters Traits wind up further defining the setting you've created.  For instance, Zoe decided that in this world being "Fostered" meant that you were not given to a set of parents by the Penitent.  I believe she decided that the "Fostered" child was instead moved around from home to home and cared for by families as a way of making up for their sins.  In spite of this, I would say that it's important that each Trait selectable is loosely defined.  That way people aren't puzzling over the differences between Traits like "Bad" and "Tough".  <br/><br/>I felt it was also important to note that a character's Schtick and Glitch should be <i>as dynamic as possible</i>.  They should describe the way a character acts, what they do.  What it really comes down to is a simple matter of phrasing.  Just ask your players to make their Open Traits as pro-active and adventurous-sounding as possible.  Looking at some of the Traits that the players turned in right now, I do wish that they had some more punch to them.  That's something I'll talk over with the play group before next session.<br/><br/>And in the next post... the Friendship Questions!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_130792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/130792/#Comment_130792" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-27T07:13:32+00:00" title="February 27, 2008  7:13AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Michael, this is the first beta playtest of this game ever. I'm so glad things went well for you guys. Have you played yet (and just not written about that part so far)?<br/><br/>I appreciate your suggestion about Description. Name should probably come last too. Also, on open traits, you're right they should be quite dynamic. Like Yasov's could probably include a bit of fleshing out; instead of Unflinching, maybe Unflinching in the face of danger or Unflinching Badass.<br/><br/>I can't wait to hear more!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
