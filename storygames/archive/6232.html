For this scenario, I've decided to take an approach that I've never tried before: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashomon_%28film%29" rel="nofollow">Rashomon</a> story. I plan on having the scenes of the game flash back and forth in time, with present-day scenes involving a current hunting case, and flashback scenes involving personal recounts of a specific event. See, there's a "questionable event" that happened before the game's scenario begins, and each of the characters at some point will have to recount their version of the actual events, playing heavily upon their own agendas, biases, and levels of Trust.<br/><br/>Anyway, my intention is to have each player take a turn at running a scene in the game. This scene will essentially be the same scene told several times over, with each player getting a turn to GM their character's story of what happened. I want the other players to participate as their characters in this scene, but I'm not 100% sure how to go about it.<br/><br/>Some factors to consider:<br/><br/>* How to handle moments in which the told facts contradict?<br/>* How to express the "author's" prejudices and opinions of the other characters in their actions during those scenes?<br/><br/>Any advice? Any suggestions? Anything I'm missing?  I seek your advice!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_138298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138298/#Comment_138298" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T06:49:14+00:00" title="April  5, 2008  6:49AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 5, 2008 6:50AM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds really fun.  I think if you're clear about the Roshomon metaphor - that everybody is supporting the guy currently telling the story, and that if he thinks their character is a dick, they need to be the biggest dick possible, it'll be fine.  It'd be fun to ask everybody to play their national stereotype as hard as possible.  Depending on your players, you might want to let them prep a little - if you want to get really fancy, you could give each a page of information to work with about the setting, location, characters, events, and have them all be slightly different, introducing unique stuff if the players wanted to.<br/><br/>Again with the clear communication, because everybody needs to be on board with a relatively fixed outcome - none of the player's characters die, for example (unless one does, which would be really cool).  But Roshomon is your guiding star.  let the facts contradict and just see what happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_138322">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/138322/#Comment_138322" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-05T11:32:45+00:00" title="April  5, 2008 11:32AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the idea, one thing that I've done is had players instruct each other on "how to play their characters" to fit the perception of the other characters. It has mixed results, some people have such a clear idea of their character by the time they've played them a few sessions that rattling them out of that position is extremely difficult.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_139385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/raedwald" title="raedwald"><img alt="raedwald" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/raedwald">raedwald</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/139385/#Comment_139385" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-12T05:48:56+00:00" title="April 12, 2008  5:48AM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One possibility might be to do the flashbacks in reverse chronological order, so each flashback explains why previously descrived events happened, rather than elaborating their consequences. This shake-up of the ordering worked for a <a href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com/snowball.php" rel="nofollow">Snowball</a> scenario created by Guy Jobbins, <a href="http://www.twistedconfessions.com/files/Roundstone.pdf" rel="nofollow">A Rough Night in Roundstone</a>, in which none of the players knew what was really happening until the final scene.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
