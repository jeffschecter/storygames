A pick-up game to make up for a pick-up game (SotC), if you like. I was the GM, and the players were Wishsong and Asdee, both experienced roleplayers in both trad and indie games. We all had a blast, and I'll put down my impressions on the game in two parts.<br/><br/><b>Part 1: Setting up the game</b><br/><br/>We chose the God-Kings of War oracle, and came up with:<br/><br/>A demon of rage and avarice, secret power behind a great tyrant's rule.<br/>A tender of war-bulls, shaved-headed and fearless.<br/>The guardian spirit of a foolhardy, naive, reckless and impressionable young person.<br/>A warrior overcome with the weight of his weapons and the smell of gore.<br/><br/>We only had about three and a half hours to set up and play, over IRC at that, so we kept the cast at a minimum and went through chargen quickly. Asdee chose the young person guarded by the guardian spirit, a young warrior of prophesy named Kassan on a quest to overthrow the tyrant. Wishsong chose the tyrant (he has a disturbing fondness for zealots and despots), called Ugranash. I took the demon, the guardian spirit, and the tender of war-bulls, and left off the overcome warrior, partly to save time and partly because Asdee thought the young and idealistic Kassan might grow into that warrior.<br/><br/>Assigning dice to the action types were done in a snap, a testament to how well IAWA works as a pick-up game. When players are given traits or skills to assign dice or points to, they often become bogged down in weighing their options. Simply assigning a die to each pre-set action type was much more intuitive. Similarly the NPCs were very easy to stat up. I left the particular strength rule alone in the interest of time.<br/><br/>Naming the best interests was another great part of the set-up that was quick yet added a lot of depth to play. By having the interests be named in turn, the players and I could build in a lot of conflicts right from the outset. For instance, I started off with Ailkidar the demon's best interest, which was to overthrow Ugranash and install Kassan in his place. Asdee's Kassan, true to form, wanted to kill the tyrant. The tyrant Ugranash, of course, wanted to find and kill Kassan. Then I had Kassan's guardian spirit, Aisha, work against him by having her best interest be to keep Kassan from tasting blood. Ugranash's other best interest was to build a huge statue that would commemorate his reign, which I answered with Kurosh the bull-tender's best interest to free his herd of war-bulls from the demeaning work of building the statue and back to the field of war. We ended up with:<br/><br/>Ailkidar - Depose of Ugranash and install Kassan in his stead; Spread the pain and misery around as much as possible<br/>Kassan - Depose of Ugranash; Limit the sacrifice to himself<br/>Ugranash - Find and kill Kassan; Build huge statue to commemorate his reign<br/>Kurosh - Set the war-bulls back on the path of war; Defend Ugranash<br/>Aisha - Keep Kassan from tasting blood; Defend Kassan<br/><br/>In this way, we built the backbone of the drama fairly quickly and smoothly as we named the characters' best interests. As long as we remembered to have the characters working a at cross-purposes to each other we created a lot of spark and drama in the set-up that we only needed to release through play. The best interests kept the pace of the play tight and exciting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin" title="ElectricPaladin"><img alt="ElectricPaladin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayStressed.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ElectricPaladin">ElectricPaladin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183352/#Comment_183352" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T21:58:13+00:00" title="December 14, 2008  9:58PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            AND!?

Dice weren't often needed, but when they hit the (metaphorical) table the stakes were high. I simply explained the mechanics as we played our first conflict, and the players caught on quickly. It was by and large fun and exciting, but we did hit a couple of snags with two-on-one conflicts.<br/><br/>The first bit of difficulty we had was when Kassan was in a battle with Kurosh, who had been sent with his war-bulls to kill him. Aisha was in the conflict as well, and tried to bear Kassan away from the battle both to protect him and to keep him from killing Kurosh. She beat both Kassan, who was struggling against her, and Kurosh, who tried to stop her. However, what would have happened if she beat one but not the other? That was the players' question, and I didn't have a very good answer other than that it depended on what the answering character's controller narrated.<br/><br/>This hypothetical came to pass in the final showdown with Ugranash, when Ugranash challenged both Kassan and Aisha, who was trying to protect Kassan. He beat Kassan decisively by doubling his roll, but gained only an advantage over Aisha. Kassan was out but Aisha wasn't, and since her involvement was to protect Kassan, I didn't know what to do with her. In the end I negotiated, offering to have Aisha take the blow and be destroyed, and Kassan's player Asdee also negotiated to have Kassan fall into battle-madness and become the tyrant's berserker fighting slave.<br/><br/>And so Kassan the hero was overcome by blood-lust and violence to become the tyrant's slave. It appears the don't-kill clause that Aisha worked so hard to keep was one of those fine prints in prophecies and sales contracts that always screw you over in the end. Thus ended the attempted overthrow of the tyrant, in this wicked age. The players and I agreed we had an awesome time, despite some confusion with the conflict rules as described above. IAWA worked well as a pick-up game, and we would try it again should the opportunity arise. This time with the full complement of rules, preferably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_183355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eldir" title="Eldir"><img alt="Eldir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i182.photobucket.com/albums/x208/loki_laufeysson/goplay_dotted_32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eldir">Eldir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/183355/#Comment_183355" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-14T22:26:00+00:00" title="December 14, 2008 10:26PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, and also: Due to the two protagonists being apart from each other until the end, it helped to have the players pick up NPCs when their PC wasn't on the scene. For instance Asdee played the minor role of a sculptor being threatened by Ugranash, while Wishsong, Ugranash's player, played Kurosh in his stand-off with Kassan. In that battle Kassan ended up killing Kurosh dead after he struggled away from Aisha, neatly scrapping her best interest. It was great!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
