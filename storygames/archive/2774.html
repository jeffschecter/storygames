I don't like the word so much - it's also used in writing to denote a momentary conversational pause - but the ideas pretty neat. It's the smallest unit of something meaningful happening in a story. In a lot of situations, it's interchangeable with a scene, but not always. A scene may have multiple beats, such as a large party which might have a seduction and a confrontation, each involving different characters. Similarly, a given beat, like a chase, may take place over several scenes.<br/><br/>This is a pretty fine difference, I know, and 90% of the time it probably isn't even worth making, but this was an oddly liberating distinction for me. See, I've been dwelling on adventure design in terms of scenes because, quite frankly, it's probably the most effective model I've seen for the simple reason that it is the easiest way to tie a game directly into your players. Given that, the concept of the beat fits my needs a little more precisely than a scene does. It invites a little more flex in planning, allowing be to isolate the beats, then turn them into scenes. Since gaming invites the occasional disproportionately involved scene (notably, fight scenes) then it gives me an opportunity to look at a scene I'm going to run and ask myself how many beats we're going to have in the scene, and maybe throw a red flag if the scene's not hooked in enough.<br/><br/>This is also a more useful yardstick for pacing than scenes. The number of scenes in a given session is not always going to be indicative - a lot of scenes can still have nothing happen, and a lot can happen in a few scenes. The number of beats in a session is a much more effective measure of how much has actually happened in a game.<br/><br/>I'm excited about this tweak in perspective, but I admit, I'm hung up on the word itself. I either need to come to terms with it or come up with a decent alternate term."<br/>(Rob Donoghue)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63231/#Comment_63231" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-08T18:41:39+00:00" title="April  8, 2007  6:41PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Question:  I'm confused with how a Beat can carry over multiple scenes.  Anyone have an idea of an example of this?  Is this just having some sort of background/personal conflict which carries itself through several scenes or the entirety of the episode?<br/><br/>Aside from that, at a glance Beat seems equivalent with "Conflict", but I'm wondering how we can distinguish Beat from Conflict (and why we would want to).<br/><br/>And far be it from introducing more jargon in a vacuum, I'm thinking how the above can relate to a gaming session.<br/><br/>Would a Beat be a bit of exposition, in other words just the spotlight shining on that character for a bit?  Do they have to have a meaningful choice or do something meaningful for it to be a "beat"?  Or do they just have to be featured there?<br/><br/>This term is, like Rob, tickling something in my brain.  Not sure if it's the Next Big Thing, but I'd like to see what we might be able to do to :<br/><br/>1) Explain beats a little better, and <br/><br/>2) Relate it to gaming.

To put it in terms of a simple conflict (in the form of a chase scene), say that the stakes are something on the order of 'The cop catches the villain' versus 'the villain gets away'. That is the central conflict of that 'beat'. Now, we could extend that basic 'beat' across a numer of scenes (possibly intercutting them with something else happening) and the essential 'something meaninful' (or, the stakes) have not changed... it is just that the beat has not been resolved yet.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr something like that.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn game terms, a beat stretching across multiple scenes implies that there are multiple 'small resolutions' (or bits of color) before you are actually allowed to decide the 'big resolution' and end the beat. There is, of course, no reason that you NEED to take multiple scenes to resolve a beat...since in the example given, a single scene may have multiple beats.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems like a fairly good pacing mechanism... not altogether unlike 'Bringing down the Pain' in TSOY. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo my understaning, trying to translate the term, the most clear 'game' revelation that comes from using beats is an implication that whenever a 'meaningful conflict' occurs (a beat), there is a brief moment to let the prescence of the dillema sink in... before we swich to another scene or another element in that scene (to create tension).<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example:<br/>\nDinner Scene -<br/>\n(Two women are talking.) One offhandedly remarks that she slept with the other's boyfriend. There is a shocked expression on girl 1's face and...<br/>\n *beat*<br/>\n(Swift cut to a group of well to do men, talking about sports). There is a swift knock at the door but it flies open before anyone can answer it. Standing in the door is a man, torn and bloodied, clutching his side. One of the other gentlemen looks surpised and says "Louis... but you are supposed to be dead!"<br/>\n*beat*<br/>\nCut to somewhere else...<br/>\n<br/>\nNow that is pretty soap-operatic but it seems like an interesting way to keep tension high.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_63246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jasper%20Polane" title="Jasper Polane"><img alt="Jasper Polane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jasper%20Polane">Jasper Polane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63246/#Comment_63246" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T02:08:09+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  2:08AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Beat" is a confusing term, because it's used for two things:<br/><br/>1. It's most often used to describe contained moments within a scene. In this case, it's a smaller measurement of screentime, used to plan the pacing of the scene. For example "He walks to the table. He sits down." is a beat. In a screenplay, you often see this written down as a direction for the actor, as in "wait a beat". This is the momentary conversational pause Rob is talking about, although it's not just used for conversation. In an animation script you'll read "he hangs in the air for a beat", for example.<br/><br/>2. "Story beats" describe the pacing and rhythm of the story, obviously. It's like Brian says, if you had to describe what the episode is about in five sentences or less, each sentence would be a beat. It's just a jargon term for "sentence", really :-)<br/><br/>It's a planning device for building your story structure before you have divided it into scenes. "Beating out a story" is just writing down your story in the structure you're going to use. After the screenplay is written, you hardly talk about beats anymore, except for as described in 1. You talk scenes, or sequences.<br/><br/>(There doesn't have to be a conflict in every story beat, by the way. You often need exposition as well.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_63249">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass" title="BigJackBrass"><img alt="BigJackBrass" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/576/nNQFOT4MURTFT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BigJackBrass">BigJackBrass</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/63249/#Comment_63249" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-09T04:03:46+00:00" title="April  9, 2007  4:03AM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I first encountered this in an RPG context in Mike Pondsmith's <i>Dream Park</i> game (from 1992, I believe), which had a pretty decent chapter on constructing adventures using the Beat Chart method.

Later, he finds that she works for the enemy minister Marobei.<br/>Heavy Blade, an assassin who kills to raise money for the expensive medicine to cure his daughter, is hired by the enemy to kill the PCs.<br/><br/>As it stands, it's much as Rob says: It's a way to make sure that all characters (and thus players) have *something special* to do in the game.
