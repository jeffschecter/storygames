It's a great resource for GMs. In fact, it's powered by reader submissions, so really it's "By GMs for GMs". :-D RPT.com has been around for a long time. 500 issues is not a trivial accomplishment! Johnn has been providing and facilitating this great exchange of ideas since 1999!<br/>\n<br/>\nIssue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23500&amp;Mode=like">#500</a> is coming up around the corner and Johnn has a contest for this special issue! You can win prizes just for submitting your ideas!<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Johnn%20Four">Johnn Four</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText"><b>New Contest to Celebrate 500 Issues</b><br/>\n<br/>\nTo celebrate upcoming Issue <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23500&amp;Mode=like">#500</a> for Roleplaying Tips we're holding a contest.<br/>\n<br/>\nRPT reader Daniel at www.steamcrow.com said we should do 500 of something, such as 500 random city encounters. That's pretty ambitious, but it sounds like a great idea. Let's do it.<br/>\n<br/>\nI've got some prizes lined up, as well, to further celebrate.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>How We'll Get to 500</b><br/>\n<br/>\nSend in city encounters 1-3 sentences long. Any genre is welcome, no game rules required. Each encounter should contain some conflict to make it interesting to play. For example:<br/>\n<br/>\n\u2022 A poisonous animal has slipped into a potter's store and the owner hires the PCs to kill or capture it without breaking any of his wares that line walls and shelves.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\n<a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.roleplayingtips.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">Read More...</a>.<br/>\n<br/>\nI believe the community-at-large can help RPT.com and Johnn easily get to 500 city encounters. I hope you will jump in and submit your entry today!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
