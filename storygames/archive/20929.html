Here's Paul saying it well:\n<blockquote>I think your expectations for a game which delivers on the whole "plotting and intrigue" dimension haven't been met yet, by existing game design*.

And then the next step would be finding how to transmit those abilities to other people (whether through design or something else), which may be an equally daunting task.</blockquote>\nSo yeah, I agree with Paul on this: it is interesting how there is a glaring hole on intrigue games. The best games in the field are <i>Paranoia, Amber, Diplomacy, Conspiracy of Shadows, Houses of the Blooded, Covenant</i> and <i>Spione</i> (I'm sure there are others, that's just my list off the top of my head), and that's just a mix of old classics and games that only brush the topic instead of tackling it head-on. I think this is pretty interesting, as it's clearly a topic and an idea of gaming that has clarity: many people think of it, it's obviously appealing, and we can sort of see how it goes. There are many boardgames about it, too. Many of us have played highly successful campaigns around the idea of intrigue (myself included, with Paranoia), yet here we still are, without an obvious go-to rpg.<br/><br/>Compare this to some other clear, definite creative concepts, like "I want to play a tv show game" - the obvious answer is <i>Primetime Adventures</i>, an excellent and well-rounded classic text on the subject. If that doesn't satisfy, go for <i>InSpectres</i> or <i>Cartoon Action Hour</i> or - well, there are options.<br/><br/>Furthermore, intrigue is not the only big creative concept that has such a conspicuous lack of games. As we remarked here last month, slice of life games are also strangely absent, all in all; just like intrigue games, some do exist, but apparently none are comprehensive enough to rise to a prominent position as the obvious answer in the field. (I do not speak authoritatively on this, as I haven't read the recent field of entrants - for all I know that Ryuutama-whatsitsname is exactly this, for example, and I just don't know about it yet.) This, despite the fact that people regularly ask for games like that, it's a genre obviously entrenched in other artistic mediums, and it <i>can</i> be done in roleplaying.<br/><br/>So, this brings me to my question for the board: are there other similar interesting gaps in the game text selection? Things for which people routinely ask for, yet you can only suggest a generic title in good conscience, or some weird little game that takes 50 hours to hack into shape? Note that what we're looking for is not just a lack of tools, but a lack of tools combined with prominent desire for such. What is it that we, as a scene, are not providing for as of yet?<br/><br/>In case you're wondering why I'm curious, it's pretty straightforward: I love roleplaying, and am naturally interested in any challenges. The above two topics (intrigue games and slice-of-life) are obviously on my desk as challenges to be considered at some point in the future for the simple reason that we seem to be lacking in tools. If there are other similar blind spots out there, I'm interested in hearing more about them, too.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459235">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459235/#Comment_459235" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-13T14:04:53+00:00" title="January 13, 2017  2:04PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting topic.<br/>About the <b>Intrigue</b> genre, if I could mention 2 titles that address specifically that (and might be interesting as reference for your personal challenge) would I be OT in doing so here?<br/><br/>About other voids in the rpg-space ... do you think that <b>Scary</b> games would qualify?<br/><br/>There are a thousand and one "horror" games that actually boil down to either a simple investigation or an action adventure, dressed up with some tropes and cliches from this or that horror saga.

It's a big topic that is worthy of much discussion, to be sure.\n<blockquote>About other voids in the rpg-space ... do you think that <b>Scary</b> games would qualify?</blockquote>\nPerhaps. I agree with your analysis of horror fantasy adventure games; that's what many horror games boil down to.<br/><br/>On the one hand, there are some pretty good titles in this space, but on the other, there could be a more definitive one, too. But then again, how many people actually want super-intense horror games? Maybe it's a relatively minor niche, with actually some pretty passable service to it, in final analysis?\n<blockquote>Another niche might be competitive rpgs, as in <b>Player-vs-Player</b> rather than PvE (where "E" could be the GM or the game mechanics themselves).</blockquote>\nIs this something that people develop a desire for spontaneously? Maybe it is, I can certainly see the appeal. And you are right, it's an underdeveloped game type, all in all. Sort of a close cousin to the intrigue thing, in that one of the big appeals of the idea of the intrigue game would be in matching wits with the other players.\n<blockquote>What do you mean by "slice of life"?<br/>Could FIASCO somehow qualify?</blockquote>\n<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slice_of_life" rel="nofollow">Slice of life</a> is a literary genre/format typified by a focus on the mood and a lack of plot and dramatic events.

World Wide Wrestling is the only one that immediately springs to mind, and even that is, I think, more about wrestling as entertainment and drama, not that that diminishes from it at all. I've been letting the idea for a competitive kendo/naginata game roll around in my head for a while, and I know someone started a thread on S-G sometime in the last year or two about sports in storygames that I don't believe gained much traction. It seems that on most traditional RPG forums whenever someone broaches the topic, they are inundated with a bunch of unhelpful responses telling them to go outside and play sports instead.<br/><br/>Re: <b>Slice of Life</b>, I've long been an outspoken supporter of the idea that the Kancolle RPG (based on the Japanese browser game/media franchise Kantai Collection, about anthropomorphized WWII warships) comes really close; the core of the game takes place in light improv roleplay scenes that are randomly rolled off of a bunch of charts, which include results like "bringing snacks to someone on watch," "being stuck inside on a rainy day," "a fight erupts during exercises," etc... Of course these are also mated to a lot of board-gamey currency-juggling and occasional GM-inserted setpiece battles, usually with a simple objective that the slice of life scenes are just assumed to take part during the completion of, but to which they don't actually need to relate in any story-related way (if that makes sense).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459242">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459242/#Comment_459242" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-13T16:18:39+00:00" title="January 13, 2017  4:18PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, here's the thing about comedy in RPGs: it's the failure state of so much gaming that's supposed to be relatively serious that I think a lot of people are allergic to it. I mean, think of the "stop quoting 'Holy Grail' at the gaming table!" meme.<br/><br/>That being said, I've played a number of games that were supposed to be relatively comedic, and even facilitated one or two, like my version of Polaris where the demons are replaced with Angry Birds and all the knights are hapless stuffed pigs. I feel like the key is to run the premise completely straight-faced, and let the comedy emerge from the inherently hilarious juxtapositions.<br/><br/>A game that comes to mind that is actually geared for comedic play, or at least drifts that way super-easily, is Lasers and Feelings and all its hacks. I actually drifted it in a more serious direction the one time I ran the core game, creating a morally compelling Star Trek-y dilemma based on my rolls on the table, but that was just to show it can be done.<br/><br/>Actually, now that I think about it, Slice of Life is also a failure state pretty often. For instance, last night I played the new Adventures in Middle Earth 5E adaptation. It was pretty good overall, but the first scene of the game was just awful (it wasn't the GM's fault; he was running from a prepared module). We were plonked down in the middle of this market square with no motivation to go shopping, nor to talk to the NPCs, nor each other. Super awkward. Eventually he was just like, okay, you're leaving on your quest tomorrow. I also feel like, even here in the US of A, my friends who are into that sort of thing just go to jeepforms to scratch that itch, and have no need of tabletops.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459244">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459244/#Comment_459244" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-13T16:31:43+00:00" title="January 13, 2017  4:31PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 13, 2017 4:33PM by Upstart.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Most games don't emphasize aesthetics mechanically, which typically pushes them to be either about plot, resource management or both.

Any kind of competitive medium, really: martial arts, painting, music competitions, sports, etc. I've seen very few (any? perhaps Contenders?) games which handle this kind of thing well.<br/><br/>I also know that lots of people love <i>procedural court dramas</i>. I've never played an RPG which handled that kind of thing well.

For me, personally, court drama slots into this whole complex of related mainstream genres that might as well be called <b>professional drama</b> (the detective thing can also go in this box, depending on whether the story is really a professional drama about cops, or an old-school murder mystery). You know the list, particularly Americans have loved (and created an immense amount of) professional drama about doctors, lawyers, cops and other professions since the mid-century. I feel like there <i>should</i> be a game that basically just does this, it's such a no-brainer - so definitely counts for me!<br/><br/>Romance is also a very obvious, very challenging field. It is not as under-serviced as some (really, Emily's games are very legit, and others have contributed to the field as well, including my spirit animal Ron Edwards), but a certain under-presentation probably still exists - I phrase myself uncertainty for the simple reason that I am not certain of how the Romance genre interacts with the intimacy issues of the rpg medium in wider cultural terms - we know that games about this topic, when properly designed, appeal to people like e.g. myself, and are feasible as a non-pretentious part of a gaming oeuvre, but it's possible that there just isn't that much of a real demand for it in demographic terms. If it's just me and 20 other drama junkies with intimacy issues who like the idea of romance games, then one might as well say that we're amply served by the existing base.<br/><br/>I like updating my list concretely, so let's reiterate:<br/><br/><b>Intrigue<br/>Slice of Life<br/>Comedy<br/>Sports/Competition<br/>Murder Mystery<br/>Professional Drama</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459308">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459308/#Comment_459308" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-16T00:19:33+00:00" title="January 16, 2017 12:19AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 16, 2017 12:20AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited January 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems quite strange to me to point to the source of 'professional drama' as American TV and then say it is underserviced when -- in the same thread! -- you also pointed out that Prime Time Adventures exists and is a satisfactory 'go-to' for TV drama. Is there some version of this genre out there that is actually somehow specific enough to the profession in question that it would somehow not work as a PTA game, or would work better with some specific rules? The very fact that it is so easy to abstract the genre (whether it be cop, lawyer, doctor, whatever) suggests that these are in fact primarily television shows, and PTA as perfect a fit as one might reasonably hope for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459311/#Comment_459311" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-16T06:50:03+00:00" title="January 16, 2017  6:50AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps that is the case.

If you go by those examples, you have to conclude PTA can handle slice of life shows and mystery shows as well. IMO it can, but is at its best when those genres meet and clash, such as in cops shows.\n<blockquote>What is more relevant, though, is that I personally feel like there is more power to be achieved in the gaming tools for this particular genre.

The 1st edition game text all but presumes an adventure series focus in the GMing instructions, examples and such. The game was powerfully reimagined and reapplied as more of a drama vehicle by its early player base around the Forge. It's a case of the game text being more traditional than how it ended up being used.<br/><br/>This is not to say that PTA is not well suited for the other genres of tv mentioned here; it is, and I haven't in fact ever played a pure adventure show with it myself.

It's totally an example of the concept of underserviced thing that totally has more potential than we're currently actualizing.<br/><br/>Magical realism is an interesting suggestion, I like it as an inspiration. Ultimately I agree with Paul that it's actually pretty well in hand (partially because it's maybe not that substantial a thing, really, in terms of differentiating from other fantasy, but that's a different topic), so not really that under-serviced, but still a fine inspiration for stuff. It's sort of like how I don't feel that games emulating French movies are being conspicuously ignored - there aren't any (that I can think of right now), but French movies aren't that different from other people's movies, not so much that you couldn't just use the available tools to do that thing if you want to.<br/><br/>Suspense - or thriller, more generally - is also an interesting suggestion. I want to say that it's sort of like the step-brother of drama in terms of how you go about doing it in a rpg, but then in reality I don't think that we quite have a canonical recipe for this yet. But then again, trad style GM railroads do a <i>lot</i> of thriller (essentially jumping off from the adventure party model, with railroad pacing carrying the ball home), so it's sort of a genre that's done a lot, but rarely in a particularly clarified form. I want it on my list, though, because I can 100% get behind the idea that I'd need to make a real game for this stuff instead of the usual bullshit. I've already got all sorts of James Bond, Frederick Forsythe thinking in the desk drawer, and it's all basically because there is a dearth of games in the genre.<br/><br/>So let's update the list a bit.

Can't remember the name of the game or even if the album cover part was actually a major part of the game or not, but you just reminded me that it's a thing, somewhere.<br/><br/>Fall of Magic is another neat game built around a strong visual prop. And while I tend to balk at the practice personally, it seems that visual aids have become a huge part of a lot of online roleplaying groups even for more traditional games, with character art and setting locales lifted from the vast fantastical, pictorial depths of the internet being key to a creating atmosphere. Not only is there a lack of games built around this sort of thing, but there's probably a not-insignificant market for them too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459407">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459407/#Comment_459407" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-19T04:52:31+00:00" title="January 19, 2017  4:52AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, now I'm thinking of some sort of play by post charades thing where all or part of some of your posts has be in the form of something you got from Google Image Search.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459411/#Comment_459411" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-19T09:33:13+00:00" title="January 19, 2017  9:33AM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh man, now I'm thinking of some sort of play by post charades thing where all or part of some of your posts has be in the form of something you got from Google Image Search.</blockquote>\nI believe Anna Anthropy has actually been working on a game like that.

Generally a single detective with some supporting characters ( so really maybe getting into a 1 on 1 play design as opposed to party play, but possibly with some 'troupe" play options for the detective player).<br/><br/>By very game-y, I mean, we're going to keep score, and it is Step On Up at the player level.<br/><br/>If the <b>player</b> figures something out or gains info ( a particular clue) it's worth 3 points.<br/>If the clue is gained through character abilities/rolls it's worth 1 point.<br/>If the GM has to "give" the clue eventually in some form, it's worth zero points.<br/><br/>As with Clue/Cluedo, there comes a point where the player has to make the big, detective reveal, positing their explanation of the whole thing, again worth a certain number of points depending on how accurate they were. Positive points only, no negative points.<br/><br/>( Or they could drop the whole investigation, too stumped to continue, I suppose. The only real loss condition).<br/><br/>As for the game as a whole, I imagine it a bit like Robin Laws' <i>Rune</i>, with tools for scenario designers/GMs to rotate through the role. Whether the group of players each have their own detective(or small team) or the whole group creates one detective team they switch up playing is really a matter of minor variation, since the points/bragging rights are for the <b>players</b> rather than the characters.<br/><br/>[I also guess that inherently there is a bit of designer/GM scoring here too. If the player score for the adventure is too low at the end of it, it's a pretty good bet that the GM has made a too tough adventure/mystery for the capabilities of the other player(s)]<br/><br/>Now, I also suppose this would still be a bit railroady, but I don't know that this is a problem exactly. I'm guessing that players who volunteer for this sort of thing aren't really looking for a big sandbox style of play anyway.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459448">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459448/#Comment_459448" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-20T15:31:23+00:00" title="January 20, 2017  3:31PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do think detective duos could be a good idea, so 2 players and 1 GM, or perhaps 2 players, 1 GM and 1 NPC portrayer.

That scoring method right there already forms the basis of an elegant game.<br/><br/>The dramatic approach is legit, too. The best game along those lines that I know of is the Finnish "Subdivision 23", sadly stuck in development hell for the last few years. It's an expansive detective drama set in an ersatz Bladerunner milieu with slice of life overtones. Technically Forgite, with elegant crime-creation and pacing of crime-solving. The player characters are independent crime detectives working the night beat in a futuristic city that never sleeps, trying to solve cases and not be too horrible as human beings while at it. My favourite part of the game is the way it paces the introduction and resolution of crimes: the GM preps a bunch of different crimes for every session, throws them at the players according to an in-game clock (so this crime would happen at 1 am, this one at 2 am, etc.), and lets them choose themselves who takes what crimes, and which are left to the incompetent uniform squad to muddle through best they can. The outcome is a wonderfully rich mosaic of slice-of-life setting stuff all flowing by, with the players privileged to choose what to focus on in more detail. Solving crimes and other accomplishments have their consequences, so there are all sorts of hooks and triggers for personal dramatic arcs in between the "barf forth cyberpunk" approach to milieu depiction that the game encourages.<br/><br/>(Anybody knowing anything about my tastes in gaming will not be surprised to learn that I have sworn to finish Subdivision 23 with my own two hands if it isn't done by the time I clear my on-going projects. It's a much too excellent game to get stuck in the designer's desk drawer. Sort of like a Finnish <i>Acts of Evil</i> in that regard.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459459">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jeph" title="Jeph"><img alt="Jeph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/396/nMA3E0EWQEIUQ.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jeph">Jeph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459459/#Comment_459459" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-20T19:52:19+00:00" title="January 20, 2017  7:52PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">@Deliverator</a>, I love the idea of a "buddy game"!

Each could be responsible for a particular enemy/NPC, or they could have different rights and roles in terms of presenting clues, or whatever.<br/><br/>It would be extra fun if each "opposing" player's role mandated a certain outcome.<br/><br/>For instance, the crime mystery is about Dr. Diabolo, who is planning to blow up the Big Ben. However, there are multiple parts to his plan. Perhaps one thing that has happened is that the nefarious Dr. has kidnapped the a Royal (a young princess). There is one player in charge of this "subplot"; if the detective (or detective team) scores well enough against them, the princess can be found before she dies.<br/><br/>In similar fashion, every "subplot" or opposition player is tied to some element of the story at stake. Perhaps Eero and I are playing, and Eero is "responsible" for the princess's rescue, whereas I am responsible for the huge amount of money the Dr. has stolen. If he scores well enough, the princess dies. If I score well enough, the money is not found or recovered.<br/><br/>In this fashion, we have a mystery with multiple possible outcomes. The nefarious plot to blow the Big Ben is unlikely to succeed (perhaps), but the end we play to find out whether the princess survives, whether the money is recovered, and so on. Nuanced endings with real stakes exist, depending on the scoring at the end of the game, including possible loose ends for the "next chapter" in the story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459495">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459495/#Comment_459495" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-22T13:52:03+00:00" title="January 22, 2017  1:52PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, in a point scoring mystery game, the mechanics for the player end would be vastly easier to write than the mystery designer/presenter end methods/mechanics.<br/><br/>As for number of players, I was mostly suggesting designing for 1:1 or 2PC: 1GM simply from the practicality of getting together with people to organize a game.

And when it works, THOSE are the moments they remember and tell stories about. Not the clue-gathering legwork, not the straight combat/action scenes. They remember and praise the creepy stuff, the <i><b>horror</b></i> stuff.<br/><br/>Monsterhearts is not in this genre, nor Monster of the Week, not Buffy the Vamp Slayer or even Dead of Night for that matters. Not even the slashers gorefests like Geiger Counter or The Final Girl ... for those you sit in what you expect to be an over the top game, almost comedic.<br/><br/>Problem is, in scary-horror sessions when you do manage to get the memorable kind of moments... using the usual suspect games (CoC, Kult, Dread, whatever) most of the times it's not because of how the game mechanics work, but because the gm and players were "good" and used thespian tricks.<br/><br/>So I see both a desire for this kind of experience, and a lack of tools that <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>effectively</b></span> facilitate it.<br/>I created <b>Touched by Evil</b> exactly because I failed to find a game doing scary-horror properly :P<br/>Even Lovecraftesque and ToC are more about running an investigation that "looks Lovecraftesque" (eh eh eh) than touching on the emotional side of horror that summons dread and unease in the players.\n<blockquote>Sure, I don't mind. [Intrigue] is a big topic that is worthy of much discussion, to be sure.</blockquote>\nNow I'm not sure anymore what you mean by "intrigue".<br/>There has been a lot of talk about Player Level secrets and competitive PvP behaviours, but the best intrigue games I have ever had, the ones where the fiction ends up looking like a season from Game of Thrones or House of Cards, in my experience are those where there are no secrets among Players (except the natural "what will they do next?").<br/><br/>Kind of like the difference mentioned somewhere else between a true PvP game and a cooperative "blood opera" where the PCs backstab to no end but the Players are all in together.<br/><br/>So if you accept intrigue even without real table secrets, then I've had a lot of success with <b>King of the City</b>. It works without secrets, but it ALSO pits the Players one against each other in a truly competitive way, producing intrigue-looking fiction.<br/>I mean, you use an actual chessboard and chess pieces to perform maneuvers and betrayals against your opponents <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/><br/><br/><b>FateLess</b> is not specifically focused on this goal, but apparently it gets it accomplished spontaneously as a byproduct of how the social rules work: you can play your PC to the hilt, pursuing its personal goals, without disrupting everyone else's game and actually such "egoist/competitive" behaviour fuels a bunch mechanics that make the whole game spin better for everyone.<br/><br/>So far the only comparable results came from my old days as a Vampire Masquerade player, where exactly ZERO of the intrigue came from the game mechanics and 100% was thanks to the (un)natural selection of gm and players over the course of years, which polarised our unique will to "play political" ... so our game sessions would look like this:<br/>- gm recaps the public events of the last session<br/>- gm spends ~15 minutes alone with player-A doing his PC's private stuff<br/>- in the meantime the other players were doing nothing<br/>- rinse and repeat for all 5 players until the end of game night<br/><br/>So, all secret. For real. True player skill vs player skill, with the PCs being more of an avatar adding randomness to our otherwise chess-like maneuvers.<br/>Incredibly fatiguing for the GM.<br/>Incredibly demanding in terms of dedication and discipline for the Players.<br/>It eventually led to a lot of gaming burnouts and real life arguments and broken friendships.<br/>So, fond memories and stuff, but maybe not really worth the cost, after all :P<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/empowermint" title="empowermint"><img alt="empowermint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/empowermint">empowermint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459518/#Comment_459518" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T14:56:43+00:00" title="January 23, 2017  2:56PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In Edinburgh, the most popular request is intrigue games (by which I mean, games that tell stories like Game of Thrones or House of Cards).<br/><br/>Comedy is an interesting one, because it's both a genre and a tone. There are plenty of games which lend themselves to being played with a comedic tone, and loads of games which are meant to be serious but which can be played hilariously with the application of player wit, but the only one I can think of that actually tries to emulates the genre itself is The Play's The Thing, and that's Shakespearean comedy specifically.<br/><br/>I think the sitcom setup in particular lends itself to a gaming table vibe - a bunch of characters with complementing flaws who are trapped together. A sitcom story game would probably borrow more from improv than rpgs though? E.g. rewarding being funny with canned-laughter points or similar seems a bit empty, as being funny is its own reward anyway, and access/failure in actions isn't really a factor in a sitcom.<br/><br/>Perhaps such a game would mostly take the form of roll tables that you use to generate characters, their relationships, and a situation?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_459519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459519/#Comment_459519" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T15:50:34+00:00" title="January 23, 2017  3:50PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Perhaps such a game would mostly take the form of roll tables that you use to generate characters, their relationships, and a situation?</blockquote>\nYeah, that's basically what <i>Maid</i> does.<br/><br/>More generally, though, there are many things that rpg rules can do aside from conflict resolution. I imagine that a sitcom system would help the players to set up situations (by directing character generation and situation generation to latch together in natural ways), realize character roles (that is, figure out who does what for the comic routines) and pace the story (that is, tell them when it's not yet time to resolve, and what it <i>is</i> time).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_459523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/empowermint" title="empowermint"><img alt="empowermint" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/empowermint">empowermint</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/459523/#Comment_459523" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-01-23T17:05:35+00:00" title="January 23, 2017  5:05PM">January 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I will check out Maid! :-)<br/><br/>Traditional sitcoms tend to be quite formulaic.
