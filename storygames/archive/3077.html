As it is,  I'll try to keep it more practical, less introspective.)</small><br/><br/>I get real nervous about putting my creative work out there in a proactive way, especially in-person. It might be a kind of stage fright, or social phobia, or just plain insecurity, but the net effect is that face-to-face rejection, and the idea of falling flat on my face, is quite scary. Online, it's much easier.<br/><br/>One key way that this is a problem is that it makes it very hard to playtest my games. I've been nervous even about trying to convince my regular D&amp;D campaign that we shouldn't play our usual game but instead try this wacky, experimental thing I've cooked up, <b>Bone White, Blood Red</b>, with beads and cords and stuff.<br/><br/>So, today is <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2689" rel="nofollow">Ides of Gaming</a> locally in Tucson, with at least two people (JDCorley and Thomas D) from Story Games planning to attend, and possibly others who I could try to rope into testing it for me. And that would be fun and informative, and most of all valuable for developing the game.<br/><br/>And I'm scared shitless that I'll go there, and come off as a dork, with an embarrassing little home-made piece of crap that I won't be able to explain and I won't be able to get people excited about, and the whole thing won't be valuable at all, but rather just a big, depressing mess.<br/><br/>I can't even imagine how some of you designers get through full gaming cons and the like. But you do, somehow.<br/><br/>So what advice can you offer me for getting over my stage fright, for getting prepared (mentally and practically) for this kind of event, for making it productive and fun?<br/><br/>Thanks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70429">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70429/#Comment_70429" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T06:57:12+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  6:57AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe lower your expectations a bit?  A game in playtest <i>should </i>be busted.  If it breaks that's a good thing.  Nobody anticipates otherwise.  Come prepared to run it complete, as well as to run through the portions that you think are most problematic, in case you only have an hour or something.  Know what you want to find out in a playtest and make sure you try to answer those questions.  Make sure you note the names of playtesters so you can thank them later.<br/><br/>Also, people are nice.  And your game is already pretty good.  Have a little faith in both.  <br/><br/>So go and make some new friends, play your game if you get a chance, have a good time.  Try to communicate your enthusiasm for your game, but also communicate your enthusiasm for games in general.  That's my advice!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70432">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70432/#Comment_70432" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T07:23:48+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  7:23AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 19, 2007 7:24AM by Graham.">edited May 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Kynn, I know where you're coming from. I did the first playtest of Gay Recruitment Squad earlier this year, my first ever playtest, and it scared the shit out of me.<br/><br/>My advice, and feel free to ignore it, would be:<br/><br/>1. Testing your own game is bloody scary, because you care about your game. I don't think the nerves will go away, but it'll be exhilarating rather than terrifying. <br/><br/>2. Bone White, Blood Red is a good game and they'll probably enjoy playtesting it.<br/><br/>3. Tell one or two people, privately, that you'd like to playtest your game later. Then they might do some of the work for you - "Hey, shall we playtest Kynn's game now?" - or, at least, it'll be less of a surprise later. This saves the situation where there's a group sitting there, and you slam your game on the table and go "Hey gang! Let's play MY GAME!".<br/><br/>4. Playtest it with friendly people.<br/><br/>5. Be honest. Tell them that:<br/>a. It's a playtest<br/>b. You know there's things wrong with the game<br/>c. But you think it's pretty cool<br/>d. And you're nervous about it, so they should be nice, but if there's something wrong, they should say so<br/><br/>6. Despite being honest, bring energy to the table. Don't undersell your game.<br/><br/>7. When you come to a part of the game you're unsure about, be honest: "Yeah, I'm not sure about this bit, but let's try it".<br/><br/>8. Oh, and don't <i>force</i> anyone to play the game, because that's likely to go bad. And that means that you should be prepared for your game <i>not</i> to be playtested.<br/><br/>Hope it goes well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70443/#Comment_70443" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-19T08:17:11+00:00" title="May 19, 2007  8:17AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Never force people into it.<br/><br/>Never make it sound like you're forcing people into it.<br/><br/>I have a friend who asks "Can I rope you into a playtest of " and "Can I make you sit through some " in seriously those words. I get really offended/offput and say no. He can sure as hell invite me to play, he can sign me up to play, but the moment he makes it SOUND like he's twisting my arm...
