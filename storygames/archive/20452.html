I'll probably start playtesting this after the <i>Great Minds</i> demo version comes out, probably around late Summer.  The eagle-eyed among you will have spotted that there's a watermark. Don't worry, I'll pay for, download and paste in the unmarked version when I start printing it off.<br/><br/><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/44973653/aGiM.pdf" rel="nofollow">Cover</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
