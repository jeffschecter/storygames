I can think of a few examples of this happening. D&amp;D classes are very restrictive, so either house rules came up to make them less restrictive, add ons such as multiclassing or kits, or when a new system was designed no restrictions of any sort. If you come from AD&amp;D, character point systems like GURPS are a godsend. Realism in death and combat comes in the same way - ignoring that character death is very common at level 1, it becomes rather easy to survive things at higher levels, and that's a bit unsatisfying to some people, so again it's much easier to die in other systems (or at least seems this way - IIRC a GURPS character with 10HT was much harder to kill than any level 1 character in AD&amp;D, but the perception of the system wasn't like that). Round based combat also didn't make a whole lot of sense, nor the AC system, so everything went to second by second based combat where you controlled each action with a fair bit of detail. <br/><br/>This also shows up in the development of the Gumshoe system and Trail of Cthulhu. I haven't played much CoC, but HarnMaster is a fairly similar mechanic (d% roll under can't be that different) and what I noticed with investigative games is it was much too easy to fail when looking for clues even if as a player you knew they must be there. If you miss the clue, the adventure grinds to a halt so the system that's designed in response to that explicitly goes in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>I haven't had too much experience with systems that really bog down combat (beyond HarnMaster) and I get the impression that systems designed in the past decade seem to try and streamline it as much as possible so there isn't any looking up of tables and rolling several times to just get a single result. <br/><br/>I'd suspect that each 10-15 years of game design you could look at and see that the bulk of the systems designed in one decade solve what the systems in the previous decade did quite poorly.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267598">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tavis" title="Tavis"><img alt="Tavis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tavis">Tavis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267598/#Comment_267598" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T13:06:20+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  1:06PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 17, 2010 1:07PM by Tavis.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes.

It doesn't do detailed combat, novel-like narrative development, etc.<br/>\nb) People right away started designing RPGs to do the things OD&amp;D; didn't, e.g. the Perrin conventions evolve into Runequest's critical hit, strike rank, etc.<br/>\nc) These second- and third-generation games aren't designed to focus on the things OD&amp;D; does well, because the writers didn't need to spend wordcount describing how to do a game focused on exploration; they and their playtesters already knew how to do that because they've internalized the procedures they learned from playing OD&amp;D.;<br/>\nd) People who grow up with those next-generation games (including AD&amp;D;, in which the guidelines for wilderness encounters etc. are there but buried in amongst a lot of other text you're trained to ignore because it's all wonky pummeling rules) get their sense of what a RPG is from the new stuff the rulebooks do focus on, and lose sight of the original stuff the previous designers took for granted.<br/>\n<br/>\nand:<br/>\n<br/>\na) The designers of OD&amp;D; are 24 and 33 years old, skilled at adjucating abstract, complex, and badly-translated-from-German rules in the service of a competitive simulation game and still managing to make sure everyone gets along well enough to maintain a growing and productive wargaming club.<br/>\nb) Within less than a decade, maybe the single largest group of D&amp;D; players are kids age 10-14. The lacunae in the rules that are an opportunity for flexible and creative group arbitration to its original designers are, to these players, an opportunity to argue bitterly and exercise adolescent peer-group dynamics.<br/>\nc) Said kids grow up to write rules that remove gray areas and thus fix something that was a real problem for them, but a feature for the original designers.<br/>\n<br/>\nNote that I'm not claiming this is the whole story, just one narrative that I think is useful for talking about one aspect of what goes on in RPGs over time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267603">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267603/#Comment_267603" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T13:38:55+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  1:38PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm just going to talk about doing investigations here, but how to do it within a system like D&amp;D or CoC.

Once you figure out what they're there to do - e.g. "wow, if I roll randomly for the reaction of every creature the PCs encounter, I'll have to make sense of results like the gnomes attacking on sight and the orcs welcoming the party with open arms, and that'll mean that as GM I get to have the fun of thinking on my feet and being surprised by what happens just like if I were a player" - I agree that you can often do that with technique.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne great innovation I associate with indie games is for the designer to explain to the reader why the rules are written they are &amp; what they're trying to do. This is not at all true of old games (perhaps due to the same technology-related constraints that caused them to eschew margins and jam as much content into each page as possible) and makes it harder to figure out how you could achieve that in a different way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267615/#Comment_267615" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T16:12:50+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  4:12PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>(perhaps due to the same technology-related constraints that caused them to eschew margins and jam as much content into each page as possible) and makes it harder to figure out how you could achieve that in a different way.</blockquote>\nThis is an interesting point to me from a couple angles. One, the difference in interpretation of the rules could be because they were as short as possible, and the designers weren't technical writers. Two, complementary to the technical constraints in publishing is the lack of availability of systems - you're more likely to seriously internalise and understand a system if there aren't 50 to choose from, leading to the development of systems like GURPS - in all likelihood you would have just one system to play with and not many books, so you'd design a system that lets you get the most out of it. That of course confounds the hypothesis a bit, but it's some extra stuff to look at.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267620">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267620/#Comment_267620" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T19:32:26+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  7:32PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tavis</cite>d) People who grow up with those next-generation games (including AD&amp;D, in which the guidelines for wilderness encounters etc. are there but buried in amongst a lot of other text you're trained to ignore because it's all wonky pummeling rules) get their sense of what a RPG is from the new stuff the rulebooks do focus on, and lose sight of the original stuff the previous designers took for granted.</blockquote>\nThe more I look into AD&amp;D 2e, the system I started on, the more I find this to be the case. Stuff just got left out or glossed over, and it seems to me the people who like 2e are the guys who started on OD&amp;D or AD&amp;D 1e, and possibly B/X, BECMI or Rules Cyclopedia. If you get one of those old grognards to answer a question, everything starts making sense, but just by reading the rulebook that's not obvious. Of course, before the internet the only way to find out how to play a game is by reading instructions.<br><br>A segue from there is that it's quite possible to start playing without fully having all the rules. I remember we actually started out with the BD&amp;D player's guide and AD&amp;D DMG. Eventually the PHB factored in. I also remember reading a supplement for Palladium Fantasy 1e, and finding it made a lot of sense in an AD&amp;D context. So in the end a lot of the play was just making shit up and figuring out what worked, so the more similar games of any era were, the more likely they'd be to be played exactly the same way.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_267622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267622/#Comment_267622" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-17T19:38:14+00:00" title="April 17, 2010  7:38PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely remember from my early D&amp;D days that it took us a long time to realize that there even were separate editions.

You can't plan an adventure because a bad roll will grind it to a halt, and if you're doing that, you're wandering aimlessly. There's a reason Final Fantasy doesn't let you control the characters in cut scenes - the important stuff to move the plot forward just happens. In FF you put up with it because you don't have great control in a video game, and the graphics are awesome. In an RPG, chances are the GM isn't a master storyteller, and there's no good reason for you not to be in control anyway.<br><br/>That would also be why you have systems that specifically facilitate telling stories. Systems with universal resolution mechanics can screw up investigations, so Robin Laws designs Gumshoe which just has you get all the clues - direct opposite of what previous systems did.                        </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_267639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/267639/#Comment_267639" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-18T06:34:53+00:00" title="April 18, 2010  6:34AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Krippler</cite><cite>Posted By: wburdick</cite>ow to do it within a system like D&amp;D or CoC.

After I while these sorts of tricks were easy peasy to spot and really did ruin the fun. If "ambush the ambushers" is an important part of a scenario just make it happen.<br/><br/>I don't think it's actually a function of mechanics at all -- indie or traditional.  I just realized that these techniques were system independent when I decided to post about them.  A friend of mine had a similar distasteful response, so I thought I'd reality check with my group after running a year and a half campaign.  I asked each of my players if they could tell I was using any of these techniques and they said they couldn't.  They also mentioned that they really enjoyed the campaign and they still talk about some of the scenes.  I continued to use those techniques in the next campaign and they still couldn't tell.  To me, the whole point of GMing is to serve as an entertainer.  Maybe your GM was just not very good at it.  Using these techniques effectively takes practice, but I don't consider myself a master story teller at all and I certainly don't think I'm as good at GMing as some other people I know.<br/><br/>By the way, the first campaign used SotC and the second used a blend of FATE, PDQ, and Universalis, neither of which was a "traditional" game and the players are good at creative gaming with Universalis, so maybe their focus is different from Joe gamer.  I think it's really just about how much control of the story the players <b>think</b> they have -- it's frustrating to feel railroaded.  In games I run, control passes back and forth between me and the players, just like in normal RPG play, it's just that sometimes the players think they're in control when they're really not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
