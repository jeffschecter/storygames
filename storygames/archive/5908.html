At the end of the day, there did not seem to be a truly cohesive system in there. It was like somebody took little, collected, cool bits and pieces of crunch designed to cater to a wide variety of playstyles and then thrust them into a blender to create a what ended up tasting like a poo smoothie.

I have a box set and all the world books when WEG was having the bankruptcy sale years ago.  I even have a burning urge to set the starting point as December 31st, 1999, 11:59pm. Times Square, the ball is dropping.  Then, all the lights go out. There's panic as everyone thinks Y2K has hit. Then a mist rolls in, and there's a stampede of dinosaurs down broadway.<br/><br/>There's also the fond memories of playing when it first came out. First I played a contract ninja for a campaign that only lasted a couple of sessions. Then in the next campaign, it was my kung-fu style Luke Skywalker character, a reporter, a werewolf, and a soldier of fortune.<br/><br/>I love TORG so much, but want a different system.  I do enjoy the core TORG rolling mechanism, in principle. But in play, I'd rather not consult a chart.<br/><br/>I can see a new game where it has something like Mortal Coil's set up, or even In A Wicked Age, where the invading dimensions are determined at the start of play, and there's virutally no limit to the Possibilities. And then, perhaps BW's beliefs are tacked on, but they aren't just beliefs for your character, they are what is possible to do in your character's reality.<br/><br/>I wait with baited breath for the release of Generic HeroQuest and OtherWorlds as I think these two systems would be great for TORG, at least as starting points to drift.  I'm just not yet sure which one is better, so I'll need to play with them more.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_132119">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/132119/#Comment_132119" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-03T13:25:32+00:00" title="March  3, 2008  1:25PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love Torg.

Aside from having every cool genre you can think of <i>fighting each other</i>, you also had the nifty Drama Deck which provided awesome content for dramatic scenes, like Complications, Approved Actions (which never quite did what they were supposed to), and my favorite, breaking dramatic actions up into multiple parts which had to be resolved separately and only on certain turns.  Better advice and examples would have been useful for a lot of that stuff.<br/><br/>Good stuff.<br/><br/>If I were to play Torg - or the setting, at least - today, it would be quite different.

I haven't even shared my Real Thoughts on the game yet. Yeah, if anyone else had "mini-reviews" of the product line, toss them here!<br><br>* At one time or another I owned almost every single TORG book. Yeah, even the shitty novels. <br><br>* Space Gods was the first supplement where it awakened feelings of "Metaplot is Dumb/Jumping the Shark" in me, but I didn't know it at the time. I loved the idea of a biotech entity in the Southern Americas, but I thought it was handled poorly. Everything was Too Rifts-Awesome: More Guns, More Damage, More Psychic Powers, etc. I wished they juggled the Cosm laws and stats to not be so awesome in all ways. Althoguh in my games I, probably like many others, simply ignored that supplement entirely.<br><br>* My favorite supplement rules-wise was The Nile Empire. Gadgeteering plus Egyptian Feng-Shui architecture magic was hot. Hot!<br><br>* I was most disappointed in the Cyberpapacy supplement. I loved the idea of the realm, but for some reason I didn't like the supplement as much. It was all maps and shit, and not enough exciting situations or potential.<br><br>* Orrorsh was cool, too. Lots of juicy ideas to take. Curse magic was cool, too.<br><br>* When I sold my TORG stuff (when I returned to America from Japan, and needed to get rid of lots of baggage) I copied a bunch of sheets from the game for inspiration. One of the ones I copied was the Aysle "dozens of circles and numbers" spell creation sheet. I loved that sheet, though I never once used it.<br><br>* I really loved the axioms of The Land Below. That shit was hot. <br><br>* Probably the most useful book that came out in that five-year range, RPGwise, was the Players Guide to the Possibility Wars: It was a true player's guide, a 15-page book that allowed you to quickly generate characters and play, with some extra rules and shit. It was really well thought-out: A useful player reference, not just another splatbook (guns, cars, etc). Delphi rocked too, for the 100 some adventure seeds it gave to the GM.<br><br>* No one ever used the Sacrifice Drama Deck card. That made me sad.<br/><br/>* I too lost my Eternity Shard Die. It was one of my faves. I think I lost it camping. <br/><br/>* I never sent my own Infiniverse Updates, nor did I ever purchase them.<br/><br/>* The first internet email mailing list I ever joined was Kansas Jim's TORG Majordomo list. That was also my first brush with Japanese TORG freelancers.<br/><br/>* My own characters included a Ninja and a Cyberpapacy Sniper.<br/><br/>Damn, this is making me want to find some old books on eBay and give a campaign a go.

So the Whimsy Cards were a good inspiration.<br/><br/>Greg, being Greg (and, as stated above, being a genius), insisted we make sure the cards tied in some how mechanically.  I stil remembering him coming into a conference room with a box of business cards from the shoe import company WEG was tied to and all three of us brainstorming and writing down ideas on cards and building out the first deck.  (Wow, I haven't thought of that for years.)<br/><br/><br/>Funny story:  So, Torg is out, and I'm living in Chicago, and I'm part of a socially active group of guys who also game.  And we start talking about games.  And the brother of one of them hates -- HATES -- the Dram Deck.  Because, he says, "If I'm the GM and one of the Players wants a Romantic Interest, he'll get it <i>when I say so</i>."  And I thought, "Jesus, no wonder I hate playing these games so often."<br/><br/>You can see what we were up against in terms of Player empowerment back then.  It's not that some groups didn't function that way.  But when even offering up romantic interest by a Players cause they want it for their PC is considered radical by a GM, that's some weird stuff.

I think that the only thing we ended up really using out of that whole adventure was some ridiculously powerful handgun that our square-jawed Nile myster man insisted on using after slapping down one of those space knight guys.<br/><br/>And I remember one of our characters played the Martyr card to save the party from that nutbar with the moustache on top of the Aztec Empire pyramid in Belize or Uruguay or wherever the hell it was. A terrifically large amount of lightning damage was involved, if I recall correctly.<br/><br/>Matt - I had Shatterzone and Bloodshadows, but I never really played either of them because the settings didn't really work for me.

First, like Jerry, I was (and still am) a fan of all of Greg Gorden's RPG work (I started in RPGs with DC Heroes, got my first professional (i.e. paying) writing gig writing for TORG, and worked as the Earthdawn Product Line Developer at FASA).<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond, my group and I were lucky enough to be playtesters on several of the world books, including The Nile Empire, The Cyberpapacy, Nippon Tech, Aysle, Orrorsh, and Space Gods.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy group loved the Drama Deck. They developed an "open hand" style of playing, where they all laid their cards out face up, so everyone knew what everyone had, thus allowing the team to strategize on how best to use their resources. This led to lots situations like "If I play my XXXX card, and you play your XXXX card to help me, then he can play the XXXX card on top of that." It was a little odd when we'd play at conventions, since it seems that few other players used this same approach.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, as I mentioned above, my first real writing experience was writing short adventures for TORG, including "Full Moon Draw" and "Breaking New Ground" in the Full Moon Draw adventure collection, and "Bad Business" in the Cylent Scream adventure collection. I also contributed to "Pixaud's Practical Grimoire" and I wrote "The Storm Knights' Guide to the Possibility Wars" (about which someone upthread had some very nice things to say, which is always gratifying, even 16 years later). <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't have time to play RPGs much at all these days, but every now and again when I get the urge to drag out some games, TORG is near the top of the list.<br/>\n<br/>\nTake Care,<br/>\n<br/>\nLou Prosperi                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134201">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134201/#Comment_134201" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T17:10:36+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  5:10PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The "open hand" was not as explicitly used by my group, but people would brag about the cool cards they got.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134217">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134217/#Comment_134217" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-11T17:56:48+00:00" title="March 11, 2008  5:56PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Which flavor?

(We just assumed that the invasion had somehow cut off the city.)<br/>\n<br/>\n(For example, if you re-did the drama deck, subplot cards like Monologue might have the same effect in all realities, but you might have Technobabble cards that work best in Nippon or the Cyberpapacy, but not so well at all in the Living World.
