In middle school it was Red Box - we played a little bit of AD&amp;D with it, not really grasping that they were different games, so mostly Red Box. One of our first campaigns was very much as Eero described: we wanted to level up as fast as we could. And that was fine but it didn't really feel right.  The Dragonlance modules (and high school) were where we stopped doing this. We would level up, explore around, push back on our problems, have adventures doing so, and our goal was that at the exact moment we had done all we could with our current character effectiveness, we wanted to level up then. In other words, each experience level was a new set of character capabilities, giving us (incrementally) new trouble we could get into that we couldn't before, new goals we could pursue that were (again, incrementally) out of our reach before, and nemeses that were too powerful might now be within our reach.  If we levelled up too early, we were disappointed in the same way you might be disappointed in Nethack if you're exploring an interesting level and a pit trap drops you down to the next one.  This was the reason we implemented training times for levelling up. I think this was a rule in an AD&amp;D book.  Basically we would say, "bah, I don't have time to train right now, I have to obtain this legendary piece of jewelry for my hot elf girlfriend" and artificially string out the levelling up process if we played, say, a module, and got more XP than we expected.<br/><br/>White Wolf's XP system was almost entirely pacing. Eero thinks:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>the purpose of XP is not to be a token bone thrown to keep the players happy (Whitewolf)</blockquote>\nbut that seems way off base. White Wolf XP was virtually entirely about two things: 1) showing up to the session, and 2) interacting with the other players (including the GM). The XP rules were there to encourage a lively table, but the XP themselves existed for the same reason as in D&amp;D - to give characters the capability to get themselves into more serious trouble, and to dig their way out of less serious trouble. The high degree of player freedom given in spending XP helped with this.  "I need to go punch a dude, I want more Punching skill." You decided where you were going before you spent XP, you decided your goals for the character with the XP you had.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286434/#Comment_286434" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T10:47:28+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 10:47AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 10:59AM by masqueradeball.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would say that White Wolf XP is all about participation.... its there to reward and encourage people to show up regularly and to encourage people to "role play," plus 2e Vampire (at least) had an in fiction consideration with the "did your character learn anything." The difference seems to be that the way a White Wolf character grows is not directly fed into/feeding into the fiction. You could play a session, or a whole chronicle, where you sat in a bar and talked to people, and then walk away with a dot in Celerity, and choosing Celerity for most characters wouldn't really change the way people in the fiction treated or thought about them. Some exceptions exist (in Vampire, gaining certain disciplines was a big taboo in the fiction, other disciplines required a teacher, increasing your Humanity or Virtues should have an effect on how you play your character, etc...). So, in short, the game allows you to ignore fictional constraints/in game events to your hearts desire, and like I said in an early post regarding White Wolf, I think this is because, though the designer would probably like you to have your character grow organically (I remember there being advice to that affect), they left it along because they didn't want to "rock people's boat."<br/>\n<br/>\nI would comment that the important reward cycles to watch in a WW game are rarely XP... Humanity in Vampire, Renown/Rage/Gnosis in Werewolf, Pathos and Angst in Wraith, etc... those were the things that if you addressed them in play differentiated that play from say, Dungeons and Dragons or even other horror games like Chill or Call of Cthulu.<br/>\n<br/>\nOr as another example. D&amp;D 4. (Some) people hate it, but I honestly think its the first example of coherent-tending design in D&amp;D history, but it fails to close the circle because there's this big fear of "telling people how to play." (I could go into detail but don't want to derail the conversation).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286435/#Comment_286435" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T10:51:04+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 10:51AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, I don't know.

The only "reward" in xp is if you're into power fantasies, but need the game to make you earn it so it feels more real. Actually, not quite right - the other way for xp to be directly a reward is if it's used to keep score, as it is in some D&amp;D versions. All other purposes for it are more complex and only rewarding insofar as the XP system actually drives the game's engines towards greater heights.<br><br>Anyway, my experience with D&amp;D mirrors Jason's. I'm especially enamoured of the notion that the reason for having character advancement in that game is variety and a growth towards new challenges as the old ones go stale, all stapled into an appealing fictional story about growth into herodom/dukedom. D&amp;D is of course such a wide game that there are plenty of different attitudes towards this thing in its different play cultures. Another attitude I rather like is the one where XP is just a score-keeping device, and the system is fine-tuned to make its benefits nominal, enabling fresh characters and veterans side by side. I'm seeing these tones in that new <i>Lamentations of the Flame Princess</i> D&amp;D-spinoff, for example, as it seems pretty diligent about never making the player characters into invulnerable superheroes.<br><br>My experience playing WW games is really quite nominal, but I've played other games with essentially that same xp system - it became very common in its day, I still encounter new designers strutting out those same moves today. My own read of it is that it's vestigial: the system is intentionally made equalizing between different players to reduce competition and it's intentionally made so slow that it has no discernible impact on moment-to-moment play. It's also completely point-based and player-controlled when it does do something so as to not cause any upsets. In a word I find it hopelessly dull, like the glorious D&amp;D system viewed through a stained glass. My pet theory of how this sort of xp system came about is that the game designers during the late '80s when we started seeing this sort of thing really wanted to get rid of the D&amp;D leveling activity altogether, but they were so mired in the traditional game design structures that they were unable to provide players with real alternative play activities. That's where you get a game like Vampire that tries hard to be dramatic and moody and whatnot, but really spends most of its wordcount speccing up character crunch to keep players happy and hungry for more; the xp system is then there simply as something to keep the players coming back and keep the players committed to their characters. Just come back for three more sessions and your character will get another dot!<br><br>So yeah, I don't have a very high opinion of the static xp set-up where you give the same small number of points to each character after each session. It has all the signs of vestigial ritual activity that could be done away with altogether were the designer not committed to making a compromise with his every act of design. Alternatively, it's good for limp-wristed groups that don't want any competition but want to feel like their characters are growing stronger in their hamster wheels. In either case it's only a reward mechanism by the virtue of incoherency: I fail to see why the players should actually care about the xp, and as it comes to them completely automatically, the game wouldn't really change if they just dropped the whole thing.<br><br>The above contains no hate for any real people, I'm just telling you what I see when I look at a static xp-dole system.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286447">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286447/#Comment_286447" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T11:48:40+00:00" title="August 15, 2010 11:48AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 11:49AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, but the game would change.

Or the new one for that matter. I couldn't tell how many sessions of play you actually needed to get that dot of Celerity.<br><br>I have to say that my own viewpoint on this xp rate thing is coloured by a play history wherein XP in traditional games <i>never</i> made any difference. My first decade of roleplaying was mostly using late '80s systems that often had that same xp philosophy Vampire has, and at least the way we read and implemented those games experience points were a purely theoretical feature that never had any major impact on play. A big reason for this was that our campaigns rarely went over six sessions or so, while the xp systems of games like BRP, Cyberpunk 2020, MERP and such routinely assumed insanely long campaigns. I don't remember that this would have bothered me at the time, but neither did I ever get anything out of experience subsystems except the abstract promise that if we hypothetically played long enough, any particular flaw of my character's could be remedied by experience. Perhaps this was different for others at the time.<br><br>The point being, I'm totally the wrong person to evaluate whether some xp system that takes three sessions to do anything matters. I'm experientally inclined to think that if a given subsystem does not activate during the second session at the latest, it's not really there for practical purposes. Might have psychological impact, and probably will: I can totally believe that the idea of building your character up into a master of his discipline would have been a motivating factor for Vampire players despite the boring xp system.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286477">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286477/#Comment_286477" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T13:37:24+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  1:37PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 15, 2010 1:39PM by JDCorley.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, sure, a short amount of play time kills the advantage of a forward-looking XP system. A forward-looking XP system that says "buy what you think you will need next, or what you want to do next, or what your character wants to do next" completely fails if there is no "next" or if you might as well not worry about it because the group will fall apart anyway, due to brain damage or whatever.<br><br>Getting a bump in Celerity was easy in 1st edition (because there were so many easy ways to get bonus XP), I'd say in 2-3 sessions or so, reDONKulously easy in LARP (if you didn't get it in 2 sessions you were probably doing it wrong), harder in 2nd and Revised Edition, maybe 3-5 sessions or so, and back to easy in NWoD, I'd say 3 sessions.  Also note that a dot of Celerity now isn't the same as a dot of Celerity then, and depending on the edition, the 3rd dot is harder to get than the 2nd.  And anyway, the Celerity-Potence-Fortitude (speed, strength, toughness) end of Disciplines were really not very flavorful, they fit more into the incremental competency area than the "new area of interest" that other XP spends could open up.

Most of the games with similar xp mechanics that I've played didn't really have such discrete powers as Vampire did (it was a very colorful game powers-wise for the early '90s), so there wasn't really that much opportunity for waiting with baited breath - most players can stand the over-bearing excitement of increasing "Shooting" from "7" to "8" quite well, I imagine. Does waiting for the next level of Discipline power work as a mechanism that generates excitement? I always saw the future-orientation in roleplaying games a bit sad as people spent time dreaming about the characters they'd like to have instead of enjoying the ones they had at the moment, but maybe that's just a part of my overall experience of short campaigns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286502">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus" title="nikodemus"><img alt="nikodemus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nikodemus">nikodemus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286502/#Comment_286502" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T14:32:47+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  2:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Does waiting for the next level of Discipline power work as a mechanism that generates excitement</blockquote>\nSometimes it did, yeah.<br/><br/>Vampire also lent (lends) itself to episodic play where you play a few sessions, and then flash forward a couple of centuries (and add a ton of XP), but that's a diffent thing obviously.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I always saw the future-orientation in roleplaying games a bit sad as people spent time dreaming about the characters they'd like to have instead of enjoying the ones they had at the moment</blockquote>\n...while I have nostalgic tingles from "just one more XP and...", I very much agree with this too.<br/><br/>OTE was serious kick in the head for me in showing how people can play the character they wanted from the outset, instead of trying to grow the "starting character" into that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286504/#Comment_286504" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T14:40:52+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  2:40PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>Does waiting for the next level of Discipline power work as a mechanism that generates excitement?</blockquote>\nIf you really, really want that next level of power, then yes, it can.  It's the same kind of excitement you get when you sock away money every week to buy something: when you know that you'll finally be able to afford it this Friday when your paycheck arrives, it's a big deal.  The anticipation leading up to the moment when you finally realize your desires is a big deal.<br/><br/>Now, it's hopefully not the <i>only</i> source of excitement in the game, because that would suck.  Ideally, you'd want to have fun and excitement in every session, with the added bonus of looking forward to finally getting to play around with that awesome new ability.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Eero Tuovinen</cite>I always saw the future-orientation in roleplaying games a bit sad as people spent time dreaming about the characters they'd like to have instead of enjoying the ones they had at the moment, but maybe that's just a part of my overall experience of short campaigns.</blockquote>\nI think it probably is just your experience, as you say: if you know your game has no future (or at least not one which can support slow-burn XP systems), you're better off limiting your view to just the character you have at the moment.  Don't bother looking at anything in the book that can't be done by the character you have right now, because you'll never see it in your game.  And that's fine, for a short game.  It's highly focused, and that can be good.<br/><br/>TylerT's remark about "tutorial levels" holds true for a lot of games intended to support a wider variety of stories, though, and if for some reason you can't just jump right in with a story about characters who can do a lot of crazy things very very well, then building up to that point makes sense.  And being able to look forward to the character you'd like to have in the future is fun in that context, because you know you can get there; it certainly doesn't detract from whatever fun there is in playing the character you have now.  (The two might actually feed into each other: the obstacle that stymies your current character fuels your anticipation for the power that will make that obstacle easy to overcome.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_286514">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286514/#Comment_286514" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T15:01:27+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  3:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The interesting thing, though, is that as I've gotten more opportunities for long-term play this decade, the very thing I've grown to dislike is long-term character planning and ensured character integrity.

Not exactly headline news there, but still, it's always good to figure out what it is exactly that you don't like.  If you don't like being able to plan ahead and be in control of character advancement, that's good to know.  Doesn't mean that those systems are awful, it just means they won't appeal to you.<br/><br/><br/>What irks me about some experience systems goes right to the core of pacing:  if I'm stuck in the "tutorial level" when I don't want to be, then the game drags for me.  I feel like I'm standing around waiting for the good part, marking time and grinding out XP until I can finally play with the toys I wanted to play with.  I think the worst offender in this regard was 7th Sea, which sold me so hard on the idea of rollicking swashbuckling adventure with neat powers and a setting that the characters could dramatically affect...but used character creation rules that kept the Good Stuff firmly outside the reach of a starting character, and had such an excruciatingly slow XP award system that you'd have to play for months and months before you could get to do even one of the dozens of cool things the book promised.  Once we'd gotten the basic mechanics down, I wanted to jump right into all-out chandelier-swinging craziness...but the only way you could do that was to set aside the XP rules and agree that, for no particular reason, everyone was now instantaneously awesome instead of having to slog their way to awesomeness over the course of thirty or so adventures.  <img alt=":(" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/frowning.png" title=":("/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_286536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/286536/#Comment_286536" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-15T16:09:02+00:00" title="August 15, 2010  4:09PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            i really really like how mouse guard handles this stuff.<br/>\n<br/>\ni recently dealt with the problem of character progression, and i'm interested in what you guys think of it<br/>\n<br/>\nthe game has a few things that relate to character progression<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer Tasks<br/>\nSacrifice<br/>\nvictory bonus<br/>\ntrait levels<br/>\n<br/>\nPlayer Tasks are the main resource of progression, they can be used to try and find an item, gain health/spirit, or gain a trait level.

I'm not sure which games we're talking about, but Vampire, Werewolf and Wraith (and to a lesser extent, Mage and Changeling) were ABOUT how uncool you were: in Vampire you were supposed to chaff under the authority of the ancillae and the elders, in Werewolf the big bad's minions were suppose to be scary enough to make those heroic sacrafices meaningful, and in Wraith being a cog in the wheel was one of the major themes if not the major theme of the game. Power creep literally ruins those games. Sorry if thats too off topic, but sometimes the pacement of advancement is meaningful in how power changes the way the players relate to the world.

So, I hope that eliminates any accidental ass-holery on my part.<br>\n<br>\nWhat about the other point though, that perhaps the slow pacing was a desired effect, that it was suppose to make the players feel frustrated at how little their characters could accomplish and how long it would all take? Even if thats not a play style that you (Bret) enjoyed and felt that you had to modify, is that a way in which XP could/should affect pacing... a sort Tantalus' curse. I've never articulated my thoughts about the WW XP system and I would argue that the whole Tantalus analogy could be used to create some cool play, especially in a horror setting. Also, totally aware that I could be reading way too much into the authors intentions (Mark Rein-Hagan and Iam Lemke, as well as some of the late stage Wraith and Changeling developers really rocked my world, so I might be trying really hard to give them more credit than they deserve, just read the introduction to the original Masquerade LARP and then try to find anyone else who manages to be so open and hopeful about how RPGs can save the world, which I know is a little silly, but really heartening to me)<br>\n<br>\nPS: All that, "this is how I feel about these games" is just to put my biases out on the table... what I want to address is how XP affects pacing in games, specifically the Tantalus model, so sorry for all the tangential stuff.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287109/#Comment_287109" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T06:56:28+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  6:56AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, there's nothing wrong with a slow-paced game, it's just a thing, you desire it, or you don't.

This makes no sense to me. Why play Vampire if you don't like the way that it was intended to be played when I'm sure there are games out there designed to support the type of play you want. If I pick up Vampire its because they make a promise that the game will provide a certain play experience and because I want that play experience, the only rules I should be ignoring are none, because it's their game. If I wanted to play a different game, I would buy it or make it. A modified version of Vampire at a certain point stops being Vampire and starts being something else. That something else may be better for you, but it is essentially your own creation. This is one of the problems of talking about RPG design, the tendency for players to ignore the predefined content of the game for home designs, but not recognizing the fact that they are not playing the game that they purchased, just something based on it.<br>\n<br>\nAnd I would like to think that my brain is functioning, and if a group of players and I were playing a game and they/I weren't having fun I wouldn't suggest that they just start ignoring and changing the rules. I would suggest that they keep trying and maybe with increased mastery they'll come understand the game better and see whats enjoyable or that they play something else. If I was reading a novel and I didn't like where it was headed I wouldn't just rewrite parts. If I was playing monopoly and I didn't like paying rent I wouldn't decide my pawn was a squatter. First I would finish the novel or game of monopoly and see if the difficult parts paid off and if not I would probably use that information to make a better choice on my next read or my next board game pick.<br>\n<br/>\nI also think that the basic premise of playing a game which you don't like until you rewrite it to be a different game hurts the RPG market. Look at d20. 100s of publishers committed to maintaining some sense of "its still playing D&amp;D" while shoehorning an often ill fitting design into every game concept and every set of priority of play they can find, and doing it cost many companies (and good games) there existence. BESM springs to mind as a good example, but I'm sure there were plenty of others (Didn't Dead Lands flop as a D20 product before being re-lauched as a Savage Worlds setting?)                        </br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287405">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287405/#Comment_287405" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T21:52:05+00:00" title="August 18, 2010  9:52PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>If I pick up Vampire its because they make a promise that the game will provide a certain play experience and because I want that play experience, the only rules I should be ignoring are none, because its there game.</blockquote>\nThat's...an interesting opinion.<br/><br/><br/>(hang on while I make some popcorn, I don't want to miss a moment of this show)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287406/#Comment_287406" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T22:01:08+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 10:01PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: masqueradeball</cite>If I pick up Vampire its because they make a promise that the game will provide a certain play experience and because I want that play experience, the only rules I should be ignoring are none, because its there game.

WW didn't make a mistake with their XP decision, you just want a different one. It doesn't make Vampire a bad game, indeed, the fact that it still works when you change it up makes it a very, very good game.  Sure, at some point a modified Vampire is no longer Vampire, but really, the moment you say "Let's do a Vampire game in 1978" and change absolutely nothing else, you're still not playing the Vampire that's written, and there's no line that can be drawn to say that changes on this side of the line are good, virtuous, reasonable, and changes that go too far, to the other side of this line are bad, wicked, unreasonable.<br/><br/>I don't even understand the d20 thing? Of course I know nothing about business, so whatever, maybe people like me who like having fun playing RPGs rather than adhering strictly to an ironclad code of conduct laid down by Mark Rein Bjork Hagen, who's never even heard of me or my game are killing the industry.  In that case, what the fuck are <i>you</i> going to do about it, tough guy, do you got a fucking problem with me killing this industry? Because if you're right, I'm going to murder this fucking thing with a knife and none of you assholes are tough enough to stop me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287408/#Comment_287408" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T22:22:07+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 10:22PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Look, I'm not arguing with you that you should change the way that you play, nor am I saying that my observations about the effects of what I would call "shoehorning" hurts the industry is something that you should be concerned about. If I said that I think that people should recycle would you decide that that was a good time to cuss at me and tempt me to stop you from littering? Its just my opinion, and maybe a misplaced one. The point of this thread was about XP and pacing. The question that I asked was if people thought that having a Tantalus model of XP (where the goal always just seemed outside the players reach) might change the way people approach the game in a meaningful way, if the XP structure might affect the play. If you don't think that's something worth discussing that would be fine. I offered my view on how to approach design coherence (as a total package) because I thought it explained why I thought that such an XP system might be meaningful in play and as a counterpoint to the position you presented in the previous post (as I understood it). If I somehow characterized your view as extremist or uncompromising I apologize, but I don't appreciate you characterizing mine in that way, to suggest that I don't like having fun or that anything I do is "iron clad" is silly and totally nonconstructive.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd Vampire is built to accommodate changes in the narrative, and I know that there's that Golden Rule thing, so technically, the book says, do what you want with the rules, but you could do that without the book.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287410">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287410/#Comment_287410" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T22:32:09+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 10:32PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here we go again...  *sigh*<br/><br/>This is such an interesting topic, too.

I even agree with it!<br/><br/>It's just that I think it's an argument for why you need to be <i>thoughtful</i> about changing rules, not an argument for why you <i>should never</i> make changes.<br/><br/><br/>Here's my perspective, at least:  if I don't have a particular thing I want out of a game, I'm happy going along with whatever the game text says.  But at the same time, I'm looking at it closely.  I'm thinking about the experience I'm having with the game, and I'm leaving myself open to the possibility that there might be a particular game experience that I want to have.  I'm paying attention to the rules: how they work, what they seem to be intended to do, and what they actually do.  I'm looking at this game as a general toolkit even when I'm building exactly the thing it shows on the box.<br/><br/>And maybe that's where it stops.<br/><br/>But sometimes I'll think, "Wow, I really want to play a game that does THIS."  Except "THIS" isn't something that anyone's done a game for, or I don't know where that game is, or there's some other reason why I can't get a game for it.  But I realize that I could adjust, let's say Vampire, to do "THIS," because it's already about 90% of the way to being "THIS" anyway.  So now I slip on my "let's think about this game" hat and me and my friends hash out what we need to do to slide Vampire that little distance over to being "THIS."  And we do.  And maybe we fuck it up, and we have to backtrack and rethink our changes and try again.  But who cares, it's just us playing, we can admit when we're wrong and fix our mistakes, and at the end of it all we get to play a rousing game of <i>exactly what we wanted</i>, and no one got hurt doing it.<br/><br/>I don't think this is an unreasonable position.  It might not be all the way towards the "every act of play is customization" end of the spectrum, but it's definitely in the "all games are toolkits" camp.<br/><br/>It honestly baffles me when someone says that this is wrong, that we should either be playing exactly as the designer intended or go buy a different game.  My friends and I aren't changing the rules <i>randomly</i>.  We're not changing shit just because we can.  We're attentive and thoughtful people who know what's fun for us.  We have a goal in mind, and we are using the best products available to us and our very best thinking to get us to that goal.  So why exactly is this a bad thing, again?<br/><br/>And god help me, this is what my very first gaming experience was:  I was brought up in the heyday of AD&amp;D, where every group thought about the rules, adjusted them, tested them, and messed around with how you could produce different play experiences by making changes (large or small) to a single game system.

I didn't mean to imply that the rules changes made by JD or anyone else were thoughtless or made for a worse design. For all I know the XP system in Vampire was poorly implemented and a last minute add on. What I did intend to say was that these kinds of games should be thought of as a variant, what you were playing wasn't Vampire (and I don't mean that come off as "your play was wrong play because it wasn't Vampire as written") but a Vampire variant (maybe a variant thats 1000x better, or even a variant that achieves the original design goals more effectively, or a variant that highlights a way in which the majority of mechanics are better suited for different goals, etc...) and that a variant, any variant could strongly change the way a game, especially its emergent qualities, plays.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, to boil it down my point is that talking about a games design and at the same time including variants of that design can be confusing and make it hard to address design issues, and it would be cool if people who played Vampire except gave out 10 XP per session said they played a Vampire variant and tried to be conscious of this when discussing the game in general. I wish I was clearer about things like this, its like my post from earlier, idk that I've ever played D&amp;D, because I've always just gave out experience how I saw fit, using the rules in the book as just guidelines. It wasn't until the Forge and System Matters that I started to look at why I did this and what effect it had on play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd the type of dynamic re-tooling your talking about has a huge pedigree and is probably responsible for the RPG hobby's existence. Chainmail wouldn't have grown into OD&amp;D wouldn't have grown into AD&amp;D etc... with out the experimentation of a lot a lot of players most of whom had to create rules as they went because there were no coherent systems or rule sets available to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287422">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287422/#Comment_287422" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-18T23:46:44+00:00" title="August 18, 2010 11:46PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I do know how widespread innumeracy is among the populace at large, even among people who should know better, like doctors and teachers.

This analogy makes no sense whatsoever.<br/><br/>Of course I think the XP structure of Vampire affects the play, that was the whole reason I started the thread! There would be no reason to make any changes to the written rules of XP in Vampire if it didn't affect the play. Nobody would ever do it if it didn't affect their play. In fact, the whole benefit of game customization is that you can obtain the result you want, achieve the result you think would be best and not rely on someone else. My whole premise rests on the idea that it matters what the XP setup is.<br/><br/>And really, the industry thing? I am quite serious when I say I have no clue whether treating games as toolkits for play is bad or good for the industry but if it is bad for the industry, then, in all seriousness, that is the industry's problem and not mine, at <i>all</i>, and I have absolutely no obligation nor desire to do anything good for the industry, ever.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Deliverator</cite>Also, JD (and AFT), I just want to point out one thing, something I've wanted to say before when this topic of "what the designer intended" versus "the designer is just some asshole who doesn't know me or my group" comes up:  Many people on here are either designers or regularly have an opportunity to play games with their designers (I think I'm going to start a spinoff thread for this topic).

When this sort of game comes out one guy sees a lot of flexibility while another sees a game built out of 10% careful thinking and 90% of convention. Anything in that 90% can be replaced with something else to little harm because it's just placeholder stuff, something to fill in the place conventionally expected to have some content of the sort. The reason for why you can just do whatever with Vampire's XP mechanics is that those mechanics don't really serve a particularly important or complex role in the game - they're incidental to the core of the game. The same is largely true of many other elements of the game (this sort of design being a traditional benchmark); they're just there because they're supposed to, no big deal if you swap them out or do whatever. Your game, man.<br/><br/>Although the reader no doubt arrives to this paragraph thinking that I'm attacking something here, I should note that I don't actually have anything in particular against loose design elements. They serve toolbox gaming, although I do think that a toolbox is better if it has direction and methodology behind its assortment of tools. So this is mostly an observation and agreement with Tim: some games are constructed in such a looser manner that parts of them are incidental; changing those incidental parts does not indeed change the game in such a fundamental manner that we should be talking of it being a different game. This is caused by the game's original design more than a culture of house ruling, I believe, as it seems to me that some games are house-ruled much more than others exactly because the players recognize when you do incidental placeholder design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287574">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287574/#Comment_287574" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T12:26:59+00:00" title="August 19, 2010 12:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with you to an extent. I don't think "placeholder" is quite right, though. To me that word means that the designer had no real preference for the system.  I don't think that's true, at least I assume that the designer had some goal in mind when they concocted the system, just as I urge that players have a goal in mind when they concoct their campaign. At least the designers freaked out and screamed on Usenet when people posted house rules and "fixes" for the first few years, so I assume that they had their own goals that they valued strongly enough to yell at people who had given them money. <br/><br/>In this case, I assume the designers of the various editions of Vampire had an idea for how long they wanted it to take for character to increase in power level significantly enough to handle situations they weren't able to before.  <br/><br/>I am not sure "incidental" is right either, after all, the whole point of this thread is that the XP system affects the gameplay experience, and by changing it, we change the experience. Is it incidental? Is it a Vampire variant when we give out 6 XP a session instead of 4? <br/><br/>There have been plenty of times where I've changed something that a designer thought (or I thought a designer thought) was central and it turned out not to be, at all.  I've played Vampire with Humanity crossed off.  It worked just great for what I wanted (superpowered Nixonian political backstabbing).  It was a drastic change to Vampire, but the game still worked fine for the goals I had set for it.<br/><br/>I really find it hard to care about drawing that line between essential mechanics and incidental mechanics, when I can think of a hundred examples that ride the line in both directions.  The only thing I can conclude is that the line between essential and incidental mechanics is all in my head, and bullshit.  The designer did what they did, now I do what I do, each of us with goals and ideas in mind, and off we go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287595">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287595/#Comment_287595" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T13:10:09+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  1:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think you can draw a line between essential mechanics and incidental mechanics in the abstract.  But when you start putting things in context, it becomes clear.  In your Nixonian Vampire example, Humanity was an incidental mechanic.  It was not essential for the kind of game you wanted to run.  <br/><br/>So to decide as to whether a particular mechanic is essential or incidental in the game as written, you have to infer the intent of the designer.  This is difficult at best and impossible at worst, barring having the designer actually tell you what he intended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287600/#Comment_287600" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T13:26:07+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  1:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            cwilbur,<br/>\nThe industry cares if people by games, but when people are content to buy one game or one set of games from one publisher or one set of publishers no matter how much they have to modify that content to suit their needs it denies other people the chance of having a marketable product that better addresses those needs without needing modification or at least the same amount of modification. So, if you'd rather play Aberrant than Capes, even though Capes does what you want better, Capes never has a chance of selling to you. It seems at that point you have to ask yourself why you'd rather play Aberrant (not that Aberrant is a bad game or was ever a major seller for anyone, or that universal systems are bad per se, but a stick to what you know attitude (which seems to me why D20 and Storyteller/Storytelling system are so successful) can be hurtful both to potential designers and to the people playing games, in terms of the designers being able to support further design publication and the players getting the most out of what they play).<br/>\n<br/>\nJD,<br/>\nYou can buy Humanity with XP. Humanity is what Vampire play is intended to be all about. If your players used their XP to prevent Humanity loss (even taking into consideration the fact that the ST has to accept that a Humanity gain is valid at a given point within the story) than you've drastically changed the way that Humanity loss affects their character. Suddenly, torture is a less serious affair (in game), it doesn't effect you (the character) as much. Humanity loss is intended to have a significant effect on how a character behaves in the fiction. That game when you crossed of Humanity and retooled Vampire you were no longer playing Vampire. This is not a value judgement.<br/>\n<br/>\nSaying that XP changes allowed the characters to gain power at a different rate does not address what effects it had on play, it is a given that increasing the XP alloted increases the rate of power gain (what you term capability, but that seems questionable), the question is how does that power change effect play, and whether or not the "your changes" I referred to were the only changes you ever made does not change the fact that they were your changes.<br/>\n<br/>\nNot caring about design intent seems obtuse and self defeating. How can you possibly implement a tool most effectively without knowing its intent. I could re-purpose a hammer as a paper weight or a door jam, but I would be hurting myself if I didn't realize that it would be more useful for hammering things in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287609">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287609/#Comment_287609" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T13:45:31+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  1:45PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            masqueradeball:  But if what I really want is Aberrant with faster character growth, then Capes is probably a *worse* fit for me, with the whole GMless thing and all.  You're assuming a know-nothing attitude where people stick with what they know because they're ignorant of other options, not where people find something that is close to what they want and tweak it to get it the rest of the way.<br/><br/>And, for that matter, if you want to get on a sandbox and declaim that if I change a game in the slightest, I AM NOT PLAYING THE OFFICIAL GAME -- well, feel free.

My point with Aberrant (which is a game I heart, btw) was that SOME people played it when it didn't meet their needs because the Storyteller system was something that they were comfortable with. It was a for instance, not an accusation, I thought I made it clear that Aberrant was a bad choice for people who's agenda it didn't support. Sorry if that was said poorly.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I never said that people shouldn't retool games, or I never meant to. What I meant to say that it would be more productive for people to find designs that were a better fit for there goals. I guess I should amend that to SOMETIMES it would be more productive, depending on the amount of customization necessary.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, the official or unofficial play is as meaningless to me as it is to you (I think). What I do think is that people should be more conscious of whether or not they are playing variations on a given system. The reason they should do this is because if a person says "System X is awesome, it totally is great at facilitating Y kind of play", that might be because of the variations they've made (the same could be true for negative appraisals) and that would be important to know if other people would like use that information or add to it from their own experiences.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd it doesn't assume anything about the players, because I never MEANT to say that other people shouldn't modify games. I just said I wouldn't. I don't see the point. There are too many other games out there, some of which have modular rules that can be customized to setting built in to their design. Thats a matter of taste and circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nI really feel that the only suggestion I've made, the only should or should not that I've put out there, is that people should recognize variations as variations so that there comments on a system can take the fact that they were using a variant into account. I then asked specific questions about a specific modification about a specific system in order to address the original purpose of this thread. I got an answer that *I* thought simply restated the facts that the rule was changed instead of exploring the effect that the change had on play, so I rephrased the question.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_287682">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287682/#Comment_287682" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T16:53:07+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  4:53PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 19, 2010 4:54PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>Finally, I do care about design intent, and I try to understand what the design intent of certain aspects is.

At some point, you are a real person sitting down with other real people to play a game, and having a goal in mind for that game is important.  You might decide that you want to experience what the designer tried to lay out for you, or you might have some other agenda that appeals to you more; either way, you're choosing what you want to try to get out of the actual game you're playing with your friends, and doing what you can to get it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE

<br/><br/>And yes, I agree with masqueradeball that it's often better to find a game that matches your intent than it is to heavily modify a game that doesn't match your intent.  But I don't think there's anything wrong with heavily modifying an otherwise familiar system, and there are *always* tradeoffs -- it might be the case that Capes matches exactly what the GM wants to do, for instance, but if the players won't touch anything that isn't Storyteller-derived, Capes isn't going to get that group very far.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_287723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball" title="masqueradeball"><img alt="masqueradeball" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/masqueradeball">masqueradeball</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/287723/#Comment_287723" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-19T21:02:39+00:00" title="August 19, 2010  9:02PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            No, theres nothing wrong with heavily modifying an existing system. I agree with this completely. As a follow up, do you think when discussing a game its important to indicate to people who do not know your play style that you do modify the game, and how, and to let them judge what effect, if any, this has on your feelings about the game? Because honestly that was the only point I was trying to make.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12739/xp-and-pacing" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12739/xp-and-pacing" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/12739/xp-and-pacing/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F12739%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F12739%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
