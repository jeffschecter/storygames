I'll be sharing a table with my wife Danielle's <a href="http://sites.google.com/site/creamaliengames/" rel="nofollow">Cream Alien Games</a> (site under construction). Her game, <i>Kagematsu</i>, is currently soliciting playtesting and feedback as an ashcan.<br/><br/>Come and see us at the show.<br/><br/>Will Terrell, who did <i>My Life with Master</i>'s gorgeous cover illustration is a Texan, and he will have his own table at the show. If you already own <i>My Life with Master</i>, bring your copy for him to sign the cover art.<br/><br/>If you think you can come to the show, send me an email at:<br/><br/>paul (aatt) halfmeme.com<br/><br/>And if you're an indie RPG designer with a published game or an ashcan, consider doing a table. (But decide quickly. Chris Nicholas, one of the show's two coordinators, says there are fewer than a dozen tables left. And email me.)<br/><br/>Though STAPLE! has historically been primarily indie comics, they have also had a horror novelist, zine publishers, and always have a radical co-op bookstore. And Chris Nicholas is serious about his "independent media" tag line and about broadening the focus of the show beyond comics.<br/><br/>So I'm doing STAPLE! because I think the indie RPG community should be developing relationships and synergies with the indie comics guys. Have you seen <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26623.msg254112#msg254112" rel="nofollow">my thoughts</a> about how Gen Con could better support the creative dynamics of the indie community? The indie comics guys already know this. Tables at STAPLE! are an affordable $75 for a full 8' table or $40 for a half table (4'). Indie comics guys maintain their creative vitality by forming up into projects, splintering off into side projects, and doing special event projects. They recognize that a creative identity is about both independence *and* finding shared purposes. And their shows, and their fans support this with enthusiasm. We have a lot more in common with the indie comics guys than we do with the paradigms of freelancer-driven RPG publishing.<br/><br/>Paul                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_185212">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185212/#Comment_185212" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T13:54:12+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  1:54PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul Czege</cite>Have you seen<a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=26623.msg254112#msg254112" rel="nofollow">my thoughts</a>about how Gen Con could better support the creative dynamics of the indie community? The indie comics guys already know this.</blockquote>\nAh, just caught that thread, and I agree with you completely. Unfortunately, there's gonna be no way that GenCon is going to change that dramatically in order to make less buck. Foam Sword Place is going to make more money than 4 Forges or 2 Mongooses/Chaosiums/Others. I think that's going to be a lost cause, personally. It's set up and propogated itself on the selling of goods. Those goods have slowly changed over the years (the GenCons in the early-mid 90s were still mostly game companies, now it's about half game company, half T-Shirts/Vids/Kilts/Video Game/Other), but the sell-focus mindset (over a "Hall of A Representation of Tabletop Gaming!" mindset).<br/><br/>But things like STAPLE! remind me of the origins of huge indie comics expos like the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comiket" rel="nofollow">Comiket in Japan</a>. IIRC, although the lottery is exceedingly hard to pass these days (so many artists, so few tables; even though that's still thousands and thousands of tables), there is no actual fee for running a booth at the event. I find that STAPLE!'s low buy-in totally matches that DIY/creator mindset. I've been really interested in perhaps after this next year, like, rarely ever going to Gen Con again in favor of other events (like GAMA, Dreamation, and more local cons in the area and areas where friends live).<br/><br/>Won't be able to make it this year, but I'll seriously consider next year. Or if something similar happens on the East Coast (from DC to Atlanta) I'd be all over that. If anything, I think the folks of the Forge Diaspora should be aiming their production schedules and print runs to be able to go to and sell at events like STAPLE! rather than GenCon. But half of this mindset is based on a preconceived notion of what STAPLE! and its attendees are like, I don't actually know what it's *really* like until I go.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185214/#Comment_185214" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-29T14:06:20+00:00" title="December 29, 2008  2:06PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd love to go but there's not enough time for me to put something together.

For whatever reason, I've had a much more success selling my wares at Staple than I have at two other big indie conventions, APE and SPX. I sold out of the two runs of mini-comics I had and got rid of some sculptures besides. People seem more willing to take a chance on new things, because they don't know what to expect. They're fans of comics in general rather than fanboys there to seek out big names, because there are few such people there. I've said before that I think game designers should get in on conventions like this, because people going in are going in with open minds and they're enthused to discover stuff. It's the perfect place to reach potential new players.<br/><br/>I'll be there in March, with a table of my own. I'm looking forward to it and hope to see some of you there. I'm a resident of Austin, so If you're not from here and need any information about the town, let me know and I'll be happy to help you out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_185351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/185351/#Comment_185351" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-12-30T15:53:24+00:00" title="December 30, 2008  3:53PM">December 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, this year is out, but, yeah, like Andy, I think it would be really cool if hobby publishers (as opposed to commercial indie publishers that sell at least 500-1000 copies a year) hit shows like STAPLE!, Dreamation, and the indie comics conventions (SPX, etc.) and left GenCon to its own devices.

It's pretty good.</p>\n<p>The interview struck a decent balance between promoting indie-rpgs-as-brand and educating about indie-rpgs-as-movement; it was primarily targeted at an audience unfamiliar with creator-owned RPGs (but very familiar with creator-owned comics.)  Luke talked about the Mouse Guard RPG, and how he came to be the guy who wrote it.  Paul talked about a lot of things, but I was most interested in his thoughts on greater synergies with the indie comics crowd (aside: I wanted more on this topic, and more probing questions on the topic from the interviewer.)  Danielle talked about the history of the indie rpgs presence at GenCon, as well as occasionally geeking out about indie comics.</p>\n<p>Overall, this was a good listen which clocked in at about 17 minutes.  Critique?  Paul, Danielle -- promote your own stuff with more enthusiasm and pride!  You've both got great games, and it sounded like you were apologizing for talking about them.  Luke -- you need to swear more.  There was only one instance of profanity, so I wasn't sure it was you.</p>\n<p>Cheers,<br/>\nDarcy<br/>\n(cross-posted from the <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=27377.msg261350#msg261350" rel="nofollow">Forge</a>)</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_196390">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis" title="Grant Davis"><img alt="Grant Davis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Grant%20Davis">Grant Davis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/196390/#Comment_196390" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-10T07:23:12+00:00" title="March 10, 2009  7:23AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, I COMPLETELY missed this thread.
