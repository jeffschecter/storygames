Long story short: we ended up playing PTA set in the same Star Wars universe from the Gen Con Star Wars PTA game I've played in and has been podcasted by Canon Puncture.<br/>\n<br/>\nI have written up long play reports on both the Pilot and the first regular episode, linked here.

By the second round of scenes, everyone was fully into the technique, even if at times some players had some trouble getting off the DM-narrates-everything paradigm of more traditional RPGs. They all loved the concept of shared narration, and though at first they tested the waters, asking/seeking my permission to affect the narration, by the end of the session they were full partners, checking in with the rest of the players to make changes in true collaborative fashion. Even the guy who was a bit apprehensive at first bought fully into the game and played his character to the hilt, especially once he internalized that we were going for drama and that that pursuit was what would determine the course of the story.<br/>\n<br/>\nTurns out that this is a Star Wars TV show that rewards the uberfans. Two players (the Archivist and the Historian) are very well versed in Star Wars lore, and they drew on that knowledge to shape their characters, especially the Historian, with all the gadgets spanning millenia of Star Wars history. I know a fair bit, but I had to ask at times for the references in order to grasp what they were going for. The cool part is that it sort-of forced me to dig around the Wookieepedia a bit to understand the bits of history they had chosen to call on, and now I look forward to bringing some of this knowledge back into the game, capitalizing on the characters\u2019 flags.<br/>\n<br/>\nOne thing that pleased me tons was when they \u201cpicked up\u201d that the setting, with its noble Houses and Emperor(s)-figure looming in the background was drawing its dynamic on Dune, after which they informed their dealings with the nobility through that lens. I write \u201cpicked up\u201d above because, in truth, this was them layering that idea down on the setting; in our Star Wars PTA game, though we have Lord Han Calrissian as a player character and certainly the noble houses have been used to great effect, we have not gone down the Dune road for modeling those interactions (at least not to my knowledge). That the players layered down this template upon the game setting, all by themselves with no involvement from me whatsoever, was in my eyes the crowning moment of the night in terms of seeing them fully run with the PTA style of play.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn retrospect, there were a few things that need to improve. Some of the conflicts we played through could have been a lot more powerful; very few of them involved the characters in tough dramatic situations the kind that you normally see on TV, and none involved two player characters facing off against each other. It\u2019s not that those are absolutes in every PTA game, but they have been a part of my experience, so I was looking for them all night, but not quite getting them from the players. Given I was the one with the most PTA experience at the table, I know I failed to transmit whatever I have learned as well as I could have (it also didn\u2019t help that it\u2019s been 8 months since I last played PTA and we did not have the book there for me to refresh some concepts).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe way we did scenes was a bit jumbled as well. At points one player would be framing a scene and another player would then run with it, effectively giving that player two scenes in a round.<br/>\n<br/>\nScene-framing, however, they got mostly right, a pleasant surprise considering how normally this is one of the tough concepts to get when playing PTA. Early on, I pulled out a phrase I learned from Judd at Sons of Kryos, \u201cDon\u2019t play before we play,\u201d and it became a mantra repeated a few times during the session, helping us all to set the stage for the play, and not to tell fiction involving the characters.<br/>\n<br/>\ncont.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205825">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205825/#Comment_205825" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T19:05:14+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  7:05PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Debriefing - Episode 01</b><br/>\nEven though we had some bumps and missed opportunities, things certainly improved since the Pilot session and I was incredibly pleased with that. Each of the original three players embodied much better their characters, which in turn made the roleplaying go a lot smoother. The conflicts, for the most part, drove the story forward and there were a few surprises borne out of a particular winning split combination that made for edge-of-your-seat excitement. On my end, I continued to weave bits of scenes we had already played through in the original Star Wars PTA game from Gen Con, even bringing in a second cameo by one of the characters from that group with Chodox Fett. In short, a fulfilling and entertaining session all around.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor this episode, we added a new player. The idea was not mine and I was surprised to be notified of it (Braulio said he mentioned something at the end of the previous game, which may be true and I simply did not catch it). That said, I pondered it for a moment and acceded to the addition of a fourth player, knowing from experience that this is still a good-sized group for PTA. Plus, the addition of a non-Sith brought the potential for different kinds of conflicts, as well as a way to break the \u201cbalance\u201d of the Triumvirate and to show more parts of this particular Star Wars universe.<br/>\n<br/>\nMore significant (and this is no slight whatsoever to the new player) was the addition of the Audience. I had missed that one page at the end when I read the book, and to my recollection, I have never heard/read a PTA Actual Play report that featured an Audience, so I knew this would be, if nothing else, an interesting experiment. I was pleased as punch when it turns out it added a whole new dimension to the game dynamic of the game. We had two people as Audience, and they did what any Star Wars fanboy watching this series would do: they cheered the protagonists, they cheered the antagonists, they whooped and hollered during the fight scenes, talked smack about the characters in the show, armchair-quarterbacked the action, identified with particular characters, and boasted of what they would do if they were the narrators. This, rather than distract the \u201cmain\u201d players, actually pumped them up; as characters they had immediate feedback on their actions, and as players they had a bigger pool of people to discuss where to take things when they were stuck. When it came to conflicts, the free card each Audience member receives actually made a difference at times, pushing the winning side over by a point, or even winning narration from any of the protagonists. The Audience mechanic, we all agreed, was great, because it allowed people to watch the game but yet be a part of it in some way, to share in the investment. I have heard it said that roleplaying is not a spectator sport, but the PTA Audience mechanic takes care of that quite well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe conflicts in this session rocked my socks off with very few exceptions. The players were more willing to get in too deep and we were all rewarded for it. We even had inter-player conflict, which I had been craving from the start, and it did not disappoint, even if resolving the results of that conflict took great effort, as I described above. I was particularly pleased with the very first conflict of the night between the Enforcer and Lady Vader, first because the players understood from the previous session the value of having an early conflict to make some fan mail available as soon as possible (and they used fan mail quite well during the episode), and second because I totally goaded the player into it in the hopes of seeing some character development and he did not disappoint me in the least. Yes, there were some conflicts that, in retrospect, could have been better, but they seemed to have worked during the game so it\u2019s hard to know if they were bad or just lacking.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs I wrote the report, though, I realized that at one point we did have a conflict happen before a previous conflict\u2019s results had resolved. Looking back I see it was bad GM-ing on my part: they won a conflict to learn some critical info, and rather than just giving it to them, subconsciously I guess I felt it was too easy and threw another conflict in their way. I need to be more aware of slip-ups like that in the future, though to our credit, that second conflict-within-the-conflict is what drove the story to the emotional gut-punching episode climax at the end.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere were some things that I feel were just not great. The Bounty Hunter and the Archivist remained marginal characters at most, especially the new character. Actually, the character, with a Screen Presence of 1 for this episode, was fine; it was the player that was left on the margins. I need to be more aware of this so I can bring the player into the collaborative exercise, even if his in-game avatar is not present at any particular scene (though to be fair to the new player, he took to off-the-cuff narration and fact declaration like a fish to water). The Archivist, as a character, suffers from this as well, and I need to keep an eye out and find ways to bring him more into the forefront; he is a full one-third of the Triumvirate, a Sith Lord, and should behave accordingly.<br/>\n<br/>\ncont.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_205826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205826/#Comment_205826" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T19:05:22+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  7:05PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The scene with the Archivist and the Historian at the cloning faciltity was one the hardest one to frame the entire night. The Historian\u2019s player knew what he wanted but we kept floundering with framing that went on and on with exposition and story-telling as opposed to story-doing. As Producer, I tried to help him a couple of times, asking question to help focus the meandering exposition, even getting obnoxious, I admit, in my attempts to actually get to a scene where there would be game, not just more talk. The Historian used his Next Time On and that was the clue to the actual scene to be played. It took a lot out of us to get this scene ready for play, and in retrospect (and only in retrospect), I still don\u2019t think it was the best we could have done, though we were all pleased with where it took us.<br/>\n<br/>\nA few days later I read in a post over at the Dog Eared Designs\u2019 forums that each player is supposed to say what they would want a scene to be about, with whom, what they want to explore, etc. but that it is the Producer\u2019s responsibility to actually frame the scene based on what the player requested for it. Thinking about it, though we did not play the Gen Con Star Wars PTA game like this, it makes sense, if not as a global rule, then certainly as a help that can be invoked if a player is having problems framing a scene. I need to go back and listen to the recordings of the Star Wars PTA game to see how we handled this in practice during those sessions.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_205827">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/205827/#Comment_205827" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-05-06T19:06:36+00:00" title="May  6, 2009  7:06PM">May 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's long, I know.

Since we only played one round, we ended up referring to this session as a webisode, a sort of teaser for the next full episode, thus why there are no Next Time On.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn all honesty, I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t get a chance to play the full episode, because by this point I was tired and running out of ideas. The Enforcer in particular, was giving me trouble; since this was to be his spotlight episode, I wanted to help him bring his issue loud and clear to the forefront, but I, and the other players, kept running into a wall with most of the suggestions we threw out for scenes and scene resolutions. I didn\u2019t see it at the moment, and it wasn\u2019t until I was chatting with my friend Braulio as he drove me home that it all clicked, that we made the realization why I was having trouble. I was trying to bring forward the wrong issue.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Enforcer\u2019s issue, as stated on his character sheet, is about vengeance against the Jedi for the death of his father, but every action, every decision, (most importantly) every conflict the Enforcer has been involved in, they have all been about Lady Vader. Heck, all his Edges are about Lady Vader, to hell with his dead father! It was all staring me right in the face, but I was looking at the wrong part. I got too focused on the Issue at the top of the page, and forgot to see the rest of the parts; when you combine the Edges plus the in-game events, it is clear as day that the problem is that, regardless of what he may have written as his Issue, the *real* Issue for this character is Lady Vader, and his relationship (whatever that may be) with her. The Enforcer wants to kill Lord Vader and end up with Lady Vader - that is his Issue. Perhaps he wants to be the new Lord Vader, one by marriage, not by blood bonds?<br/>\n<br/>\nI have to give heaps of praise upon the other players, because they did their job fantastically in supporting the spotlight character, both in game by framing scenes that were about the Enforcer, and as players by supporting his conflicts in order to help him he awesome. It was truly a perfect example of cooperative and supporting roleplaying.<br/>\n<br/>\nI hope to go back to Puerto Rico in June, and if I do, we\u2019ll try to get together to play the conclusion to this series (even if it means merging episodes - we can say the network wants the series to be shorter and more explosive to truly capture the audience and sponsors).

I narrated that loudly, and leaning in his direction, talking non-stop and cutting him off whenever he tried to speak, driving home the event as best as I could. He was speechless, but out of nowhere he yelled over me a retort and (with the aid of the other players) called for a conflict to assert himself. He got a couple of Fan Mail tokens from that scene, specifically because he acted in character, and true to that character as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's been a coupe of Fan Mails given for Star Wars movie quotes at the right time. The Bounty Hunter got a couple this past week for narrating new things that other players eventually used, and for inserting himself (by paying a Fan Mail) into a scene where he complicated things for the Enforcer. I also had an Audience member who got about 5 Fan Mail during the last episode just from helping people with their dialogue during narrations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248675">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez" title="Daniel_M_Perez"><img alt="Daniel_M_Perez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.dmperez.com/offline/avatars/danny_avatar_03_32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel_M_Perez">Daniel_M_Perez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248675/#Comment_248675" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-26T22:42:03+00:00" title="December 26, 2009 10:42PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2009 10:42PM by Daniel_M_Perez.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After a looong break, the AP report for Episode 02 is now up: <a href="http://www.dmperez.com/2009/12/24/primetime-adventures-star-wars-the-sith-triumvirate-%e2%80%93-episode-02/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.dmperez.com/2009/12/24/primetime-adventures-star-wars-the-sith-triumvirate-%e2%80%93-episode-02/</a><br><br><b>Debriefing</b><br>I indeed had to return to Puerto Rico in June, so my friends and I decided to do our best to finish this game in the time I had. When we got together to play, we decided to wrap up the series in two sessions to be played over the two weeks I had available. That meant condensing four episodes into two action-packed extravaganzas. I merged the Screen Presences for episodes 2-3 and 4-5, giving us two final episodes that looked like this: 2/3/2/2 &amp; 3/2/3/3. If you have played PTA you can see how that second merged episode is totally nuts.<br><br>Merging episodes as I did in this and the next one was the definition of an experiment; it worked ok in this episode because the Screen Presence spread ended up in a normal PTA range of 2/3/2/2. For the next one? Even a week prior to that game I was already dreading what a 3/2/3/3 spread would mean. Check the next episode AP and Debriefing to find out how it went.<br><br>As I listened to the recorded session to write this, I was struck by how much time in a session is spent setting up and resolving a conflict. Easily about a third of our just-under-4-hour session was spent just in this process. I mean, conflicts are at the heart of PTA, so it makes sense they get this kind of attention, but in our case it felt like a bit too much. Granted, part of it was that each conflict presented a learning experience; we were honing the art of conflict presentation and resolution, teaching those who were still a bit unsure, negotiating the true essence of a conflict and the stakes, and then figuring out how to make those happen. At times it felt like pulling teeth with needlenose pliers, but the results were worth it.<br><br>We had an issue with the Order 1-C part (second paragraph above): we\u2019re playing in Spanish with English sprinkled in; when the Rebels attack and the Mandalorian gets word from his army in orbit, he says a word. I hear \u201cuno C\u201d (1-C), so I ask him, \u201c1-C?\u201d The player looks at me with a curious look, but says yes, 1-C. It comes out a couple of sentences later that what he said was \u201cunanse\u201d (join them), in essence telling his Mandalorian troops to join the Rebels in the attack to Coruscant. This almost caused the Enforcer to attack the Bounty Hunter directly, all the while I\u2019m thinking, why is he doing this, he has no idea that that\u2019s what the order meant. We talked it out and that\u2019s when I realized that I had heard incorrectly, but that in doing so, the player had decided to go along with the crypticness of \u201cOrder 1-C\u201d (reminiscent of Order 66), while the Enforcer was acting on having heard the order to join the attack. It stayed that the Mandalorian said \u201c1-C\u201d by choice of the player, but clearing this took almost 30 minutes of our game.<br><br>Scene-framing continued to be the single-most thorny aspect of the game, though I was extremely stoked that for the most part, the players got it, and got even better as the session went along. The Archivist\u2019s player was the one exception; he just kept blocking up when it was his turn to frame a scene, and we lost a lot of time waiting for him. We\u2019d prod him, throw ideas and suggestions, wanting him to do the framing, but we had to jump him or frame for him for the most part. But then, towards the end of the session, he got it! A bit rough, yes, but he framed a couple of scenes successfully, and good scenes too. He also had problems grabbing narration and running with it, but again, he was able to take a few offered flags and turn them into cool bits of story. It was very much like being in a gym and watching someone try to lift a 100 lbs weight over and over until they finally lift that sucker right over their head.<br><br>Lastly, the audience was present for this episode too, but I found one thing to be on the lookout for: when the audience overshadows a main character. One of the audience members, Leo, was very sharp and even though this was his first exposure to PTA, by mid-game he had gotten the basics of calling for scenes and helping people to be awesome. The result, however, was at points he was earning more fan mail than the characters, by offering ideas on things they could do that would be awesome. I didn\u2019t address it during the game, but afterward I reminded the group that the player characters are the protagonists and the audience is there to support, not to steal the spotlight. That was lame on my part, however, because I still didn\u2019t address it during the game. I don\u2019t know what I could\u2019ve done, however, to fix this, or if it even needed fixing. Leo helped some players play key moments in the story (the defeated Lady Vader accepting the Enforcer with a \u201cYes, Lord Vader\u201d was Leo\u2019s idea, for example). Something to keep in mind for future games with audience members.<br><br>Next episode, the conclusion, and what a ride that was\u2026                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
