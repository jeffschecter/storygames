Nothing new actually. But instead of penalizing them or going the way of karmic retribution I'd like to let them roam free in Grand Theft Auto fashion, but including consequences to their actions.<br/><br/>Any setting economy is affected by the degree of trust and sensation of security. If a merchant in a small town is killed by adventurers and the local guards couldn't do anything about it, even if the players never go back to that town, gradually the news and exaggerated rumors will  spread to the closer towns. First, merchants will increase their security measures and maybe travelers will be prohibited from carrying their weapons into the market at least. Guards could increase, be better prepared or carry more/better weaponry and armor. <br/><br/>Merchants could also pay the local guilds for extra protection or aid to recover stolen goods, hiring either warriors, professional guards, assassins, mages, etc. to fight fire with fire. Of course, prices will increase dramatically.<br/><br/>If the local merchants aren't rich enough, then only the desperate will still try to keep their business, Quality and variety will be lower, prices will be unfair and eventually merchants will go bankrupt or move to safer places.<br/><br/>I started by making a reduced list of available goods, duplicate the price, lower the damage dice of the weapons one step and decreasing the AC given by the armors, ruling also that this quality of weapons will break when somebody rolls a fumble in combat.<br/><br/>But now I need some help at figuring out how merchants will protect themselves. Additional guards nearby and high level mercs with class level are good, but I want to keep things varied, just in case players decide to keep hitting on the same vendors or on new ones.<br/><br/>Simplest measures would be the club or crossbow hidden under the counter (maybe three to cover a larger area and hide in a way that they can be fired without having to draw them over the counter. A low level wizard could come each afternoon at closing time to cast alarm and other protection spells (I still have to research which ones and how). But I still feel I'm short of ideas. Care to help me a bit here, anyone?                 </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_448908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P" title="Stephen P"><img alt="Stephen P" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/529/n6YUPMWXC0KWV.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stephen%20P">Stephen P</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448908/#Comment_448908" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T06:06:23+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  6:06AM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bounties. <br/><br/>Basically, the merchants aren't the only interested parties: the local political apparatus will also generally frown on rampant and repeated lawlessness, especially once it begins to affect local economies and innocent citizens. <br/><br/>If the adventurers consistently break local laws without being brought to account, then local political figures may eventually post bounties for their capture, or even execution. <br/><br/>At first the bounties may be relatively cheap and only involve capture and delivery to local law enforcement. But they can easily grow, such that the adventurers face some serious threats (bounty hunter with more class levels than then, for example). <br/><br/>Once outlawed, the adventurers may also face other indirect sanctions, like local businesses refusing to serve them (or to buy loot from them), people ratting out their whereabouts, etc. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448917">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448917/#Comment_448917" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T16:11:59+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  4:11PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The merchant's uncle is a well-known, powerful cleric.

All adventurers. Never know which ones are murderhobos!<br/><br/>As a result:<br/><br/>1. Adventurers have no place to buy stuff anymore, no taverns to get drinks and rumors, and no inns to rest.<br/><br/>2. Only a handful of nefarious fences, thieves, and blackguards will agree to trade with the party. They're worse murderhobos than the party! Go to buy some arrows or iron rations from them and you're more likely to get robbed and murdered. Those who will sell to you have ridiculously inflated prices, ten or twenty times normal, and even then you're likely to get tailed by a pickpocket afterwards or rolled in your tent at night (since you can't find an inn).<br/><br/>3. Other adventuring parties with less sociopathic tendencies pledge to take care of these nefarious murderhobos. One of the other parties are actually murderhobos themselves, but they haven't done anything bad in this town (where the party is). Now the party has three powerful groups of similarly-outfitted adventurer types gunning for them. How many XP is the PC fighter worth anyway (to the other groups)?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448919">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448919/#Comment_448919" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T16:25:04+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  4:25PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The entire village that was a victim of the murderhobos gets together in the square with the local temple cleric and they pray hard. When several hundred people get together and pray fervently together, strange and powerful and magical things can happen.<br/><br/>Depending on their local religious affiliations, this has one of these effects:<br/><br/>1. The party is Cursed until they change their ways and make things Right. The curse is terrible and makes the party sick and weak. Maybe it will eventually kill them.<br/><br/>2. Healing spells stop working for the party. Natural healing, too.<br/><br/>3. The village summons some kind of vengeful spirit, angel, or invisible stalker. Something that can follow the murderhobos to the ends of the earth and mete out justice.<br/><br/>4. The gods answer the villagers' prayers with a mass teleport spell. That is, the divine beings think it's just easier to teleport the murderhobos somewhere far away. Somewhere away from people and civilization. Somewhere with lots of monsters, probably.

Definitely the Bounties. My lord, how could I've forgotten that! But to my defense, the first town they attacked was later demolished by a drunk troll on rampage (they gave an otherwise pacific troll the alcohol and pointed him on the right direction) so there were no witness alive.<br/><br/>If adventurers are identified as the problem, it's logical that laws that threat the adventurer's lifestyle start to appear everywhere and adventurer's themselves will get angry at whoever started it and go looking for them.<br/><br/>Definitely, if the regular market is closed, a black market will develope and become an a certain deathtrap to adventurers. Even local government will avert their eyes from them and citizen will support their actions as long as they mess only with adventurers.<br/><br/>It can be as easy as pickpoketing the party after they just bought supplies or poisoning their supplies and tracking them to finish the work and loot them.<br/><br/>I'm not so keen for the curses, as that's more "karmic" than logical. It looks too much as GM's revenge instead of the setting changing in response to the player's actions (which okey, it may be another more subtle form of GM's revenge but at least it's more excusable). Not that deities will endorse the party actions -unless we're talking of chaotic evil deities- but making the deities act directly against the party kinda defeats the purpose of having faithful adventurers and avatars around to do their bidding. Perhaps some dreams and signals will be sent to these to put things in order and that will be it. <br/><br/>But anyway great ideas, I really appreciate it!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_448923">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/448923/#Comment_448923" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-10-07T20:08:43+00:00" title="October  7, 2015  8:08PM">October 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My curses idea is just that if you piss off an <i>entire village</i>, they have ways of protecting themselves through prayer. You can give the players a warning: "Hey, it looks like the entire village is gathering in the square for some kind of meeting. The head priest of the Temple of Justice is presiding over a ritual. They're all holding hands and chanting... actually, it sounds like they're chanting your names... You're just watching?

The next morning, she's gone - with, for some reason, a lock of hair from the PC.<br/><br/>Everywhere they go, a strange cloud follows them, often blocking out the sun for most of the day.<br/><br/>Ravens start to gather around the group.<br/><br/>The PCs all awaken at night from the same nightmare (which, perhaps, depicts the demon which is being sent after them).<br/><br/>And so forth...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
