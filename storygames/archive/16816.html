The original author is doing a total re-write, and while brainstorming ideas I came up with something cool: a play technique to simulate MSPA's beloved flash animation updates.<br/><br/>Here's what I have. I'd appreciate any thoughts - my main interest is getting the epic feel of a flash right.\n<blockquote><h1>Flash Updates</h1>\nAt some point, things may have progressed to when someone feels it appropriate to use a flash update. Good moments are the climaxes of major plotlines, a Kid entering, a Kid hitting god-tier, or any big fight. A player can call for a flash update by saying something to the effect of \u201cI think it\u2019s <b>Time for a Flash</b>, guys\u201d.<br/><br/><br/>First off, a flash needs music. Pull up Youtube or Soundcloud, start playing something fitting for what the group has in mind. Chiptunes and orchestral music might work well, anything epic and instrumental. Everyone should be able to hear it.<br/><br/>As soon as it starts playing, the Director (whoever called for a flash) points towards someone. They quickly describe a visual. The Director keeps doing this, pointing to people at appropriate times in the music, and they continue the story by describing what\u2019s \u201con screen\u201d at that time.<br/><br/>After a bit you\u2019ll start to get a feel for where the music is headed: follow it. When the music starts escalating, kick things into high gear. When it hits the chorus, revisit what you showed last time it came around. When it hits the bridge, switch to something completely different. You get the idea. This might take practice to get the hang of.<br/><br/><b>Tips:</b><br/><br/><br/>Don\u2019t take thirty seconds to say the perfect thing. Don\u2019t even take ten or five seconds to say a good thing. Take one or two seconds to say a passable thing. Yeah, you might\u2019ve come up with something better if you took an extra ten seconds or so to think, but achieving the full effect means keeping up the unrelenting momentum, grabbing the story by the throat and not letting go until the end.<br/>Don\u2019t describe what\u2019s happening, describe what we <i>see</i>. I used the term \u201cvisual\u201d on purpose. Imagine you\u2019re a screenwriter, choosing what to show the audience at what moment.<br/>Keep the visuals simple. Most visuals are just panning shots of one or two characters doing something flashy. Most visuals in this context won\u2019t even be full sentences (just saying something like \u201cJohn crying\u201d works).<br/>When you\u2019re really stuck, here\u2019s some things you can do:<br/><br/>Revisit something someone else brought up, either showing it from a different angle or refocusing it. \u201cJohn\u2019s tears falling\u201d as a response to the above, for example.<br/>Just blurt out something random. Honestly, even if half of you are only doing this it will still probably make just as much sense as your average Homestuck flash.<br/>If you really have nothing and the clock is ticking, just say \u201cPass.\u201d and the director will move on.<br/><br/><br/></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred" title="Wightbred"><img alt="Wightbred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/349/nEG30XDP3MO0A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wightbred">Wightbred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383723/#Comment_383723" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T09:12:11+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  9:12AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I need to parse this a little more, but I love the concept.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_383731">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK" title="JonatanK"><img alt="JonatanK" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JonatanK">JonatanK</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383731/#Comment_383731" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T10:36:22+00:00" title="June 28, 2012 10:36AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I like it too. It also fits nicely into the feel of the game as it's growing on me: not much ownership but a lot of collaboration, and the rules decide which type of collaboration you're doing for different situations (run around following commands, dialogue, flash etc.)<br/><br/>Maybe relevant: I'm the "original author" JS is talking about. My first try was an AW hack consisting of basic moves, some character moves to pick from pretty freely, inspirational lists for all sorts of stuff and some notes about how the story should progress. We played it, and the only thing that felt like it added to how our session would have gone if we had free-formed completely was the lists. Consequently I dumped all the AW stuff \u2013 even though the basic moves were for things that felt fitting, the whole "when a character does this, decide how it goes for them through this" layout of moves wasn't what the game should be built about.<br/><br/><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o_cbHVmUViaLaMrb9JA5A9ExoKhpicW_eGseEtYqltM/edit" rel="nofollow">Here's</a> the draft document I'm currently working on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_383812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/383812/#Comment_383812" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-28T18:29:41+00:00" title="June 28, 2012  6:29PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jonathan, I think you should seriously consider contacting Hussie to make this thing official.

Don't bother calling it an rpg, just say "these are the rules, this rule is kind of like when this thing happens in Homestuck, ya?"

WALL OF TEXT INCOMING!]<br/><br/>Good morning everyone. Last night we had the opportunity to play the Homestuck RPG The Second Draft over Skype using the Infrno game table to take notes.<br/><br/>Our game is called RoomTrapped.<br/><br/>The Players:<br/><br/>June played the character DORY POTTER, also known as gallopingGunslinger.<br/>Maeve played the character ANDREA STRUMPETTE, also known as drawnChef.<br/>Mike played the character CHARLES FREDRICKTON THE THIRD, also known as fickleCharlatan.<br/>Jack played the character ADMITTING UNIT, also known as unkn\u0268wnU&amp;\xbfiV\xb1 (unknownUser).<br/><br/>Maeve did not know Mike before the game started, but everyone else had played with each other at least once before. <br/><br/>June originally came up with the idea and she organized the game on infrno. Our game page is linked here.<br/><br/>We decided, as a test, to come to the table with varying degrees of preparation. June had her character Dory written down. She\u2019d worked out her INTERESTS and her pesterChum handle and had a description of her room. Maeve and Mike had thought about their characters, but had not written anything down, and Jack went into this without any planning whatsoever.<br/><br/>We had met the previous night for a few minutes to go over the rules, and we immediately found them quite strange. The Command structure, which makes up most of the meat of the game, appeared almost backward to how we anticipated they were going to work.<br/><br/>The conceit of the mspaintadventures comics upon which the game is based is that the updates are structured, primarily, like an old school text adventure game, with the link to the next page being a \u2018Command\u2019 being given to the character, while the text and image of the current update reflects the actions of the character in response to the previous command. <br/><br/>All text is in the second person (\u201cYou go over to your desk and look around\u201d). <br/><br/>A lot of the humour in the comic comes from the interplay between the text of the Commands and the way in which the characters respond to them, as they often misinterpret or ignore commands entirely. <br/><br/>The way the game is written, anyone can give commands to any character, and anyone can say the second-person response text that tells the rest of the players how the character responds to the commands. The only authorial power that the owner of that character has is to veto unacceptable commands. The game text suggests that you give your own Kid commands, at least at first. However, the person giving the Command can\u2019t respond to it. This means that the person who created the character is NOT the one who gets to define how their character responds to the Commands.<br/><br/>This is weird, because the Commands are not diegetic until responded too. A frequent joke command in the comic is \u201cRetrieve Arms from Chest\u201d because the style in which the comic is drawn does not include the characters arms unless they are actually needed. This command is always misinterpreted by the target character in a variety of amusing ways, (one character acquires two large novelty fake arms from a chest, the other characters respond with derision, sarcasm, or confusion as their personality dictates). <br/><br/>However, the rules appear to suggest that the person who states the Command cannot respond to the command, and that the owner of the Kid should state most of the commands to that Kid. Combined, this means that the Owner of a Kid actually gets to ACT as that Kid less then everyone else.<br/><br/>We started out using this style with DORY POTTER, June\u2019s character, and it was incredibly awkward. There were tons of long pauses as people tried to think up how to make this character we didn\u2019t know respond logically. As is usual in these kind of situations we covered up our awkwardness with increasing amounts of silliness. DORY\u2019s Nana rapidly turned out to be a robot emancipationist. DORY\u2019s obsessive interest in My Little Pony was made poignant and nostalgic when we learned that since the Great Pony Wars of 2013, all Ponies had been made extinct. <br/><br/>A huge amount of truly silly things culminated in DORY\u2019s Nana firing a birthday present out of a rocket-launcher at her and her retreating back to her room to check her SOCIAL REGISTRY ABSTRACTUS.<br/><br/>This, of course, caused bags of confusion as this was not something that existed in the original comic. We ended up having to kibitz for quite a while about what it was before anyone could come up with a coherent idea. Homestuck the comic benefits from having clearly thought out, but very very strange mechanics to its game abstractions, and coming up with them on the fly turned out to be confusing and ground the game to a halt. None of us wanted to attempt to replicate the comics exactly, but whenever we deviated from them we ran into muddy ground. <br/><br/>We eventually decided that the SOCIAL REGISTRY ABSTRACTUS was a facebook like game abstraction, like the Inventory systems FETCH MODUS. It displayed your achievements (DORY received an achievement for completing the tricky 2xABSCOND on a pair of gift-giving robots) and also your social relationships with the people you know. <br/><br/>We eventually decided to write \u201cWhat is the SOCIAL REGISTRY ABSTRACTUS and how does it work?\u201d As an Identity Question and Jack picked it up. We never used it again, which is likely because we still didn\u2019t have any good ideas for the rules of how it worked (and Jack was distracted, being the designated note taker for the group).<br/><br/>We took a break at that point to talk about things. We all agreed that things were really confusing and awkward, but we were going to keep going. <br/><br/>Another awkward thing we noticed was that while the Command system replicated the text of the actual comic remarkably well, it was missing one very important thing, description. In the comic, you always get an image as well as a bunch of second-person text. In an RPG, you don\u2019t get the images, and yet there did not appear to be an elegant way to include the required amount of description in order for the rest of the group to feel comfortable building off of previous Commands. Later on, when we started getting more familiar with the format, we began to just layer in description into the second person text and things started moving much better, but at first it was very very confusing. <br/><br/>The Pesterlogs worked better, but DORY was talking to people who we hadn\u2019t seen on screen yet, and some of them hadn\u2019t been worked out at all. This meant that, as we had also decided not to define character relationships before play, we were trying to speak as characters we had never played, in relationships we had never defined. This was also incredibly awkward. <br/><br/>Around the second hour of play we all realized that we had unconsciously drifted the game away from the written rules. Where before we had been having the owner of the Kid give most of the commands, and the rest of the group interpret them, we had shifted to having the group provide commands, and having the owner of the Kid interpret them. This worked FAR better, and provided a far more coherent vision of the Kids we touched on later.<br/><br/>[Continue?

You are meant to go around in a circle and describe the contents of a single panel of a comic. This is tricky, as everyone really needs to be on the ball, but works out ok, provided that nobody disagrees with what is happening.<br/><br/>In our last update before we finished for the night, we tried to do an Expose of all of our characters logging into our version of the sBurb game (our copy is called sUni, and is always referred to as Sunny, by everyone who isn\u2019t Charles). We had been mentioning that this version of the game uses a star-pattern server system, with a bunch of client-users connecting to a single server-user. The mysterious and unlucky ADMITTING UNIT, trapped inside a gigantic burning hospital, ended up being the server character for the other three Kids, but we ended up in a disagreement again about mechanics halfway through an expose.<br/><br/>We avoided the Flash updates entirely. We talked about trying one, but considering the difficulty we were having with Expose updates, and coming up with interesting and relevant descriptions without the time pressure of having to do it to music, we avoided them entirely. We discussed trying to do a Flash Update as a test, but another time, and to not consider it canon. <br/><br/>I think this is a game that really needs a \u201cDefine Game Mechanics\u201d subsystem, to resolve the kind of conflicts we ran into whenever we created something outside of the source material. <br/><br/>This game clearly favours adequate preparation. The people who had prepped their characters had a much easier time, and created much more interesting characters, then the people who had not prepared. My character ADMITTING UNIT, in particular, was a mess. I had absolutely no idea what to do with him, so I did nothing. I purposefully avoided the standard \u201cYou are shown in your ROOM so as to display your INTERESTS\u201d because I had no idea what my room would look like or what my interests were. This left me with a character nobody knew how to interact with. <br/><br/>In addition, I constantly felt like we should have prepped the Game Mechanics before we started, at least partially, so that we could have avoided some of the issues that come from trying to interact with complicated game systems we had never actually defined. <br/><br/>Ultimately, we did have fun, and we\u2019ve decided to try it again next week, but we feel as though we are fighting the system all the time.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
