The bugs were generally kept on-par with humans, but they had a cyclical breeding cycle that had 1/3 of the population breeding every 3, 7, or 11 years. 5 years ago, however, was one of those synchronous years wherein the whole bug race was breeding, and so now, they outnumber humans by a fair factor (all of that minutiae about the bugs).<br/><br/>This led to (or, well, actually emerged from) our issues: pollution, food shortages, and racism. The bugs were very efficient users of resources, but when their numbers were so high, they tended to consume everything in sight and generate a lot of waste... and they are better-equipped to survive the potential coming starvation. So tensions are high between bug and human populations.<br/><br/>Anyway, the game went pretty smoothly (a few glitches came up as we tried to figure out which ends of our fulcra we wanted to emphasize; we ended up writing down the numbers that would "hit" each fulcrum option, and then when we tried to parse out what happened when someone landed exactly on their fulcrum). After everyone had had one go-round and a single conflict, though, everyone at the table lost focus.<br/><br/>Now, that may have been based on circumstance, and it may be just my group, but it's something I see every time we play a GM-less game: after we get through the setup and initial play-stages, we all start to drift away from the game. Is it because we don't have a GM reminding us that there's a game on, and constantly pointing back at the table? Does anyone else have this problem? Does anyone have a suggestion for correction?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245328">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245328/#Comment_245328" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-05T23:38:20+00:00" title="December  5, 2009 11:38PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The role of the GM is so interesting (as is this post).  Even moreso because Shock: is an odd GM-less game that doesn't feel GM-less to me in play.  The responsibilities are divvied up in such a way and the ownership is parceled out so that it feels like a GMed game (but vastly different to me as a player).<br/><br/>In your GMed games, does the GM keep people on task and take concrete actions to cut down on out of game table-chatter?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245342">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83" title="Jumanji83"><img alt="Jumanji83" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jumanji83">Jumanji83</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245342/#Comment_245342" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T07:40:49+00:00" title="December  6, 2009  7:40AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My group and I, we play Capes a lot.

Still, we recently re-dedicated ourselves to playing every single Thursday, and gaming hard when we were together, and it was going really well.<br><br>I don't think dedication and immersion are problems: my guys are a really great group.<br/><br/>It occurs to me: Shock was a fill-in game, since our GM for that week (we block out GMing duties in 6-week chunks, because we've had a lot of "epic" games that peter out when a GM or critical mass of players get bored) so it's possible that people were less-motivated to play something that was known to be filler.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_245435">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Stigg" title="Stigg"><img alt="Stigg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Stigg">Stigg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/245435/#Comment_245435" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-06T22:01:45+00:00" title="December  6, 2009 10:01PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I've played Shock three times now and each time it has had a very different flavor for me.  When I played at Origins, we DID have a GM, but her role in it was very limited: she was mostly there to right down the minutiae and bring us back if we were "wandering too far afield" with a conflict.  In the other two games, this was not case, but we still had a tendency to wander a bit.<br/><br/>So, if anything, I think your players did what any of us do with a new toy: they played in the proscribed manner and then played with it in their manner.  It just so happens that their manner managed to lose focus.  It happens.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I'm not sure it was a failing in the game, though. Everyone seemed happy with the game itself (other than the issue with the fulcra that I mentioned earlier). I noticed particular enjoyment in the collaborative part where the protag and antag square off, each adding details to a scene, trying to bring everything to a conflict.<br/><br/>Peter: I think you've hit the nail on the head there. We probably treated the game a bit too much like a toy, and flicked all the switches and twisted all the knobs, but ultimately didn't interact with it as intended. That may well be common with a first-time-through. In trad games, we tend to make characters and then have them fight each other and use social systems against each other until we get a feel for the mechanics, and then let it sit for a while until someone gets an idea for a game.<br/><br/>I suppose the problem is, with my group and small-press games, unless I bring them something that gets them excited from moment one, a game might never get a second chance.<br/><br/>Reading these last few comments, though, and then parsing and editing my reply, I've come up with a plan. The next time I break out the Game With the Sexy Orange Cover, I'm going to explain the rules with a little twist: I'm going to tell everyone that when neither of their *tags is in a scene, it's their job to keep the scene moving and moving smoothly; basically what the GM did at Peter's Origins game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_245950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.
