Because games rely on participation, the potential to draw the audience in and deliver a powerful experience is enhanced.  I would say there are three ways to "tell a story" in video games.<br/><br/>First is the classic movie style.  The game play itself focuses on the action, while the dialogue scenes provide context.  I still vividly remember playing Metal Gear: Solid the first time and how awesomely fun that was.  I made no meaningful choices that I can remember, but the game play was fun and the story (even with it's flaws) entertained me.  One of the important elements was that the character did very little action type stuff in the cut-scenes, except what flowed very naturally from what I had already done.  In this kind of game, the player has to control all the cool physical stuff, if you take that out of their hands, the experience is definitely lost.<br/><br/>Second is the directed story with input from the player.  Again, most of the game play focuses on the action, but during the dialogue scenes the player gets to make choices that effect the course of the story.  Usually these end up being 2-3 paths to a choice and there aren't many branches (or if there are many branches, the results are not heavily scripted, but just short texts which completely falls flat).  Bioware probably has the best record with this (Knights of the Old Republic, Mass Effect), but sometimes the story can feel heavy handed or that player input isn't that extensive.<br/><br/>Third is the player created story.  You give something as close as a living world as you can to the player and just let them do what they want.  You can direct the impact of the environment and reward/punish certain types of actions to give a sense of consequence to engage the player with certain types of behavior.  I would also include MMO's in this category, as the game designer creates the setting and methods of finding players to band together with, where they are responsible for their own game play.<br/><br/>A couple years ago, I was disappointed that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Days_in_Fallujah" rel="nofollow">Six Days in Fallujah</a> was not released.  I felt it had potential to take a current event and allow players to experience it.  If done honestly and executed well, I feel it could change how we look at what games are capable of.  Similar to a how Saving Private Ryan felt real to people to watch, trying to navigate through a game like that could give people a similar experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_359438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359438/#Comment_359438" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T21:56:46+00:00" title="February 13, 2012  9:56PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Define "TomasHVM"</blockquote>Love?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359440">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roger" title="Roger"><img alt="Roger" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roger">Roger</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359440/#Comment_359440" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-13T22:14:49+00:00" title="February 13, 2012 10:14PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Should football even bother trying to tell a meaningful story?

If this is adding a significant increase in the purchase cost / delivery scedule of the game, do you still want it?<br/><br/>I see what you mean by context though.  have to admit I did like 'half life' - that used the in-game graphics to script-animate short cut-scenes as context for the next shooty-shooty.   That felt about right in terms of 'story'.  But thats more of a 'this happened and then that happened' thing.  There is no concern for characterization, relationships or moral choices, so its not much of a story.

If this is adding a significant increase in the purchase cost / delivery scedule of the game, do you still want it?<br/><br/>I see what you mean by context though.  have to admit I did like 'half life' - that used the in-game graphics to script-animate short cut-scenes as context for the next shooty-shooty.   That felt about right in terms of 'story'.  But thats more of a 'this happened and then that happened' thing.  There is no concern for characterization, relationships or moral choices, so its not much of a story.  All scientists looked and sounded identical for instance.<br/><br/>I would agree, it can often feel tacked on or doesn't fit the game well.  I would also agree that dialogue scenes or context information that happens while I'm actively playing/controlling the game can work well.  I think it's definitely a good thing that this guy is talking about the subject.  Game designers do need to constantly reexamine what it is they're doing and why.<br/><br/>If the story isn't the main focus of the game, I think the context it provides is to help make the space you play it in more interesting.  Another Valve game is a great example, Portal.  The first Portal game would be very interesting without context, I remember playing Narbacular Drop and hearing a studio had picked it up to make a full game and being very excited.  It was the context of the play space though that made the go from being an interesting novelty to one of the more memorable games of the past decade for me.  Yet there are no real choices to make in the game.  There's the famous "choice" but if you choose no, you might as well just turn it off, cause nothing will happen.<br/><br/>I'd also recommend listening to some of the commentary from the designers about the process of making the game and the changes they made.  They had to adjust the surroundings and context to make the game easier to understand and help guide the players more efficiently.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ" title="Jogesh EZ"><img alt="Jogesh EZ" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jogesh%20EZ">Jogesh EZ</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359616/#Comment_359616" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T13:20:10+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  1:20PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Games create experiences, not stories.  In this way, it's closer to life.  Which is a different sort of problem than storytelling.  You can take experiences and turn them into stories. And you may set out to experience something that will be a great story, but in life you can't determine what that story will be, though with enough control you can rule out most alternate possibilities (e.g. planning a wedding).<br/><br/>Games that push to tell particular stories are doing it wrong.<br/><br/>I think they both can tap into "meaning," but of different types.  Games like Half-Life, Medal of Honor, Bioshock, do a great job of putting you in a situation and giving you an experience of it. To varying degrees, they have other events going on, that make them story-like, but usually they're only pieces of other happenings (often, "How this situation came about" and/or "How to fix it") giving just enough information to give greater context to the experience.<br/><br/>There's a long history and acceptance of games that brute force tell a story (especially from Japanese designers). And I'm sure there were great stories here too. But they're like watching a movie, and after every action and visually stunning scene, they take a break and read passages from a book (some early movies were almost like this, and even today there are movies that use a narrator in a completely useless way for the medium).  What I'm saying is, just because they exist and are enjoyable, doesn't mean they're doing it right. I think Square proved (twice) how deep and rewarding their stories are when you strip away all gameplay.<br/><br/>Games that have done story the best usually aren't telling the story you're experiencing. Doom barely has a story. But it's an exploration of the experience of an experiment gone very wrong. Half-Life's story is very similar. You're not going through Gordon Freeman's story, mainly because you don't have any meaningful choices (the choice at the end isn't meaningful, as Half-Life 2 makes clear). You are experiencing Gordon Freeman's rise to heroism. Your skill level (or use of cheats) can make that experience very different from anyone else's, and that's why its a game. Dead Space's story is similar again. But here there's room for exploration (as in Bioshock and Doom 3), you can decide how much you discover about what went wrong in the first place. You can navigate yourself out of ignorance and come away with a story with a richer background - and the pace of it is somewhat slower and quieter - or you can ignore scattered data files and run through guns blazing. The main difference is you can uncover other stories, but you never play through those stories you uncover (though they might hint at what's to come, and certainly add tension and mood). Ultimately, it's the same story, different experiences.<br/><br/>Games give us experiences. We create stories.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359622/#Comment_359622" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-14T14:07:05+00:00" title="February 14, 2012  2:07PM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I always wonder what articles/critiques like this are trying to accomplish.

Except in cases where the game itself becomes a tangible and well-mapped part of that person's reality. If I tell stories about something I did in a computer game, it's typically not within the setting bounds of the game's internal stage, but rather about what was going on in the outside world. e.g. I could have got a perfect Tetris thing but got the one block that screwed me over and I lost. Outsmarted a particular boastful individual in Poker. And so forth. These are still stories generated by the presence of games, and may be just as meritorious as stories from story-games. These stories, though, are not fiction. It seems to me that in order to be a 'story game,' a game needs not only to generate narrative, but to generate fictional narrative. <br/><br/>On a related tangent, we have devised a few card games to play in-character at the central tavern in our ongoing fantasy game. This could be played in isolation, and I think it would still qualify as a story game, even though poker doesn't. People would recognise stories from 'story cards' as being from inside the game and stories about poker as being from the real world. So whether or not the game has its own internal space and place seems to matter too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_359770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359770/#Comment_359770" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T09:35:55+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  9:35AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Surely the people who are making video games, especially big budget video games, make their decisions based on their preferences and goals, not on critical standards.</blockquote>\nCounterpoint: <i>Duke Nukem Forever</i>, a game where every design decision was clearly neither based on critical standards nor on any recognizable preferences or goals.<br/><br/>I honestly don't know what drove any of the decisions made in that game, unless it was some kind of morbid curiosity about how much worse it could be.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_359776">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/359776/#Comment_359776" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-15T09:49:53+00:00" title="February 15, 2012  9:49AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite><cite>Posted By: UserClone</cite><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Define "TomasHVM"</blockquote>Love?<br/><br/>You just won this game.<br/><br/>Nope.

I really suggest that everyone play DNF at least once. It is an amazing game.  There literally is not a single good decision in the game - there is absolutely nothing good about it whatsoever.  After 1,000 mediocre first person shooters, to find one that was as relentlessly badly designed as DNF was actually a very educational experience.<br/><br/>But in most games, even AAA, if you listen to the people talking about their product, they have real desires to make what they're making.

The point of the essay is very clearly a question. A person's voice is not invalidated because they lack the ability or resources to prove a point by making it profitable. Government and commerce does enough of that for us, thank you very much.<br/><br/>Your counter points would be much more interesting to read than how pointless you think having a conversation about it on a forum is. And much more illuminating for us all. I don't think anyone cares what the author intended.
