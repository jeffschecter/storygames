I need bodies - I guess technically I need minds... healthy, happy minds.  <br/><br/>One of my gigs is to run games for college students in various disciplines (mostly social sciences).  I've developed a game about the complexities of a global market that runs for 30 players... I will let that sink in for a minute... yep, thirty.  The Big Three Oh.  And can run for as little as four.  All pretty much in the same time frame.<br/><br/>So now I need gamer minds to tackle it.  I want to see how you all break it.  How you bend it.  How you spindle and mutilate, but most importantly, have fun with it.<br/><br/>The more folks the merrier.  We're running it at DexCon on Saturday evening at 8pm (7/5).  Please share.  Spread the love and lets see how many talented noodles we can get in the space Vinny has for us.  Beer and pizza in our suite for those who play and want to chat about it later that evening.<br/><br/>If you have questions please ask away.  hope to see some of you in the ranks!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
