I will track the movies, which may prove a little hard, Cutthroat Island I remember seeing more than once though.<br/><br/>Monkey Island is a cool source, as is Pirates of the Caribbean, when I ponder on pirate stories I have heard I think there is a lot more ground adventure than sea, the ship and open sea are more a means of transport than a place of adventure, and using the few major figures is indeed a better choice, <br/><br/>Pondering the trade routes and what is being traded, as well as those who have interest in that is indeed a great advice, puts them against major players!<br/><br/>And finally thanks for reminding me that Pirates, like any other Sailor, love/fear a ghost story, and also feed quite a superstitious side. As for oral tradition, I love a good story beside a fireplace, in this case this alone can be a good way to impart a dread ghost story, which can also happen in a foggy ship deck.<br/><br/>I can already feel the pirate adventure mojo coming! =D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403077">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Biest" title="Biest"><img alt="Biest" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Biest">Biest</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403077/#Comment_403077" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-08T16:38:34+00:00" title="January  8, 2013  4:38PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Privateers are a cool thing too.

A lot of the lower caste/class people were gung ho about joining because pirate ships were essentially democracies.  The captain was elected and could change, everyone got to vote on important matters, though the method of counting votes could sometimes be different.

Usually using the coast and the stars.  Portolan charts work well once you hit a coast and positioned yourself in Latitude. Reading up on the history of navigation will offer lots of ideas and complications that can show up.<br/><br/>The social component Bad_Santa mentioned are something to think about too. For a Golden Age of piracty you need rich traderoutes over seas and people who are poor enough to turn to piracy. Either from within the culture or from a culture that just happens to border on the trade routes. The barbary coast might be an example for one of the latter.<br/><br/>Or you keep the flying ship a long term goal and once they have it they are able to fight the dragons in their own turf. But otherwise a flying ship can destroy lots of seafaring tropes, so you might be careful if you want it as a group.<br/><br/>What you could think about also are what creatures can be found in your seas that are different from our world. Maybe there are Giant Manatees that take the niche of whales. Or some other change. Worth thinking about for sure.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403406">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403406/#Comment_403406" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-10T23:55:55+00:00" title="January 10, 2013 11:55PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>But otherwise a flying ship can destroy lots of seafaring tropes, so you might be careful if you want it as a group.</blockquote>\nI think you could survive this if the flying had some serious limitations. <br/><br/>Only on a full moon, or only for a very limited time (perhaps it consumes some precious resource or the magical forces allowing the ship to fly threaten to tear apart the deck), or it requires some serious preparation and a heavy price, like a human sacrifice, to get the ship out of the water and up into the air.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403439">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein" title="Nifelhein"><img alt="Nifelhein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/888/nUG22UPKX7MJD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein">Nifelhein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403439/#Comment_403439" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T09:45:38+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  9:45AM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Again, thanks for the ideas, this post turned out bigger than I anticipated, but I give some background on what the game has and is going about.<br/><br/>You know, you totally made me think about clocks, longitude and navigation, meaning i did not even consider this things before. Since the world is being built around the PCs and they wanted to have the piracy theme, I am gravitating around <b>a large mass of land with numerous islands and archipelagos spread into sea</b>.<br/><br/>As for <b>trade</b>, I will probably throw the question to my players, but I am considering that the <b>continent is not completely self sufficient</b>, making navigation and sea control necessary and important, the <b>main land to be mostly barren</b> and mountains with a small fertile land near coast, the elves are spread in archipelagos and the dwarves are in the main land's mountains. Humans are much more spread out, the other races are mostly in the islands and use small vessels to travel in between close islands.<br/><br/><b>Navigation</b> then, something I totally overlooked before you guys chimed in. I will have clocks, the most precise ones are extremely expensive, very very few vessels have precise ones, the other vessels usually travel between islands with star charts and navigation charts, meaning there are a lot of islands yet undiscovered and out of the way because they simply can't be reached with the technology that is easily available.<br/><br/>For <b>alternative navigation</b> I am leaving the doors open, I think demon guidance is something that may end coming up (with a warlock in the party) but I believe both powerful sea spirits and a sea god can be asked for guidance as well. I am leaving options open here.<br/><br/>The <b>social dynamics of a ship</b> and its ruling is also something that I can explore well, in the 2nd session the player that was selected the captain by the other players divided the treasure they found as 50% for the crew and the rest for the party members, they also don't take from the crew's share for repairs and improvements (aka flight adaptation), this is a little democratic, but the ship's history is the previous captain was very successful but was tyrannical as well, his early demise made the crew select a new captain, fitting the idea.<br/><br/>In the 2nd session the players inserted a <b>mythical figure</b> into the world that <i>they</i> named <b>Scylla</b>, a creature that imposed respect, the party's Wizard used spells to create a ghostly figure that would be sponsoring the ship. I am now thinking of using both Scylla, <b>Charybdis </b>and <b>Nereids</b>, drawing straight out of the Odissey, I am also considering to make the seas more alive, so <b>Sahuagin</b>, <b>Tritons </b>and the like are probably come into the fold.<br/><br/>The <b>flying ship</b> theme is already at their reach, they still need to finance the ship modifications, since the way it is gonna happen is through a ball of energy (elemental souls as seen by the warlock) being kept under control by a stone they found (they don't know how to make one), but this also uses a specific alloy that they know of but need to harvest the materials and create, this then needs to be spread throughout the ship's structure and centered on the stone tablet to power the "system". So they are right now concerned with: an engineer, a forge for the party's dwarf to create the alloy, but they will need money to pay the engineer (if they let him live and I am doubting that), the metals (which I plan to require inland travel), time and the souls (which they have stored in an artifact they found).<br/><br/>My idea for the <b>flight is</b> that it is <b>dangerous</b> to the ship and something the engineer is not completely ready for, so the ship is at a danger, if they kill him after the first modifications they will soon regret it, as the ship will be bound to need more, also the souls that power up the system will be consumed (the original system was self-sufficient), so the time they can fly is tied to that.<br/><br/>They wanted to fly because the world also has <b>floating masses of land</b>, and they <b>wanted to pillage those</b> spoils that nobody else can get to, They created their own opportunity for it to happen though, so I am just following up with their clever ideas.<br/><br/>Lots of complications right there.<br/><br/>The ideas I got from you guys are amazing and I have to give them more thought on how to insert them into the current and foreseeable scenarios.<br/><br/>I have to track the books and movies suggested now. So much to read so little time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_403492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid" title="RobMcDiarmid"><img alt="RobMcDiarmid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/RobMcDiarmid">RobMcDiarmid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403492/#Comment_403492" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T16:40:38+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  4:40PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would suggest that you track both the Health and Happiness of the crew as things that can change at certain times. You should probably track those things on a -2 to +3 scale, so you can roll +CrewHealth to see whether they succumb to scurvy during the citrus shortage or +CrewHappiness to see how they respond to an edict by the captain. (Write up custom moves for each of those types of things.)<br/><br/>Then make it clear what sorts of things the PCs can do to effect those numbers. And put those numbers in opposition to the PCs desires regularly, to make them choose.<br/><br/>Also, Crew Health can act as a modifier to certain rolls during boarding actions and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_403493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein" title="Nifelhein"><img alt="Nifelhein" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/888/nUG22UPKX7MJD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nifelhein">Nifelhein</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/403493/#Comment_403493" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-01-11T16:53:20+00:00" title="January 11, 2013  4:53PM">January 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have been thinking abut moves but you gave me a very good direction, I was already considering happiness  without realizing, I gave them a choice on a failed roll to get part of the souls from captured scholars, they could either have them all killed (didn't capture part, but instead their entire souls) or to have 1 of the crew die, they chose to kill the scholars.<br/><br/>Having the thing laid out makes it much easier to target though.
