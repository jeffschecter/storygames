A short, d6 based, easy to learn role-playing game designed to be an ideal introductory game for new role-players.<br/><br/>Not since the early 80's and the fad-like expansion of Dungeons and Dragons 1st edition has anyone put a million copies of any RPG into the market in a fairly short time frame, and none with the specific intent of targeting potential new players. So this project aims to serve as a grand experiment at rallying segments of the hobby and industry together to set forth and try and recruit new blood to gaming.<br/><br/>In addition to copies of the "Give-Away" edition of the Dark Realms, contributors to the kickstarter will be able to select from the commercial version of the Dark Realms core rules, 11 different game supplements, the World of Chaos Campaign Setting Box set, custom dice and more.<br/><br/>For more information, the Kickstarter campaign may be view at:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/guildofblades/dark-realms-rpg-1-million-book-give-away" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/guildofblades/dark-realms-rpg-1-million-book-give-away</a><br/><br/>-------<br/><br/>More than one way to support the project:<br/><br/>1) Direct Contributions<br/><br/>Direct contributions are always helpful. Contributors will find they will get a good deal on actual Dark Realms books and products plus a number of the "Give-Away" edition of the book to spread around. Contributions go to pay for those rewards and will help fund the printing of the 1 million give-away books and their broader distribution.<br/><br/>2) Help Spread The Word<br/><br/>A project of this scope is going to need as much support as it can get.  A big part of that will be getting the word out to as many role-players as possible. You can help by letting your friends know about the project. Post it on your facebook, your gaming discussion forums, etc. Tell your local gaming friends and maybe your local retail. The more people who know about it, the more likely we'll be able to get these printed and distributed and see if this i a viable approach to spreading the hobby.<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/>Ryan

Even with everything else being equal they would still presumably find their own design the best and most interesting game, provided they have any confidence in themselves at all. One might question why a company would ever do a project like this if the point were merely to market a game made by somebody else.<br/><br/>Even if you started a project like this on the basis of an unaffiliated cultural association of some sort, with no profit motivation whatsoever, they'd still need to choose a single game to publish, thus excluding every other possible game. The publisher and creator of whichever game you'd choose would certainly thank you for the publicity windfall.<br/><br/>Of course one might question whether it's smart to go with a game that has not been extensively quenched in real play conditions; most likely a proven masterpiece would be a better game than your average new, unknown title. The advantage of building a game from the ground up for something like this is considerable, though, as you can adapt every detail for the specific publishing scenario. So it's a choice between having a technically superior game that might be slightly off-tune in terms of length or complexity or genre or whatnot, and an inferior game that has been specifically planned for this publishing eventuality. Both are fair choices, especially when you remember that it's the publisher who ultimately makes the choice on the basis of how they view things themselves. I assume that the Guild would choose Apocalypse World for this if they thought that it's somehow an absolutely superior design in comparison to this Dark Realms.<br/><br/>If I were to speculate about alternative games to try for this kind of thing, I might go for a streamlined version of OSR D&amp;D myself. It's a game with an existing support network and social scene, so it'd be easier to get help from like-minded individuals in funding and marketing the new effort. It's also a game that translates well into a lightweight introductory product once you redo the mechanical bits to match modern sensibilities. There aren't many existing games out there that combine these virtues.<br/><br/>Hmm... there's probably a missed opportunity here for activating grassroots support, as the Guild has chosen to do a closed design process culminating in this Kickstarter project. It seems to me that it would probably be easier to get people behind something like this if the design and development of the eventual free introductory game were entirely firewalled off the publishing end. That's probably how I'd have set up something like this: first design and develop the complete introductory product as a free and open Internet crowdsourced project, and then seek separate funding for printing and distributing this already existing introductory thing to the masses. Crowdfunding is about advance preparations after all.<br/><br/>All in all, an interesting project. I hear that LotFP is doing a similar crowdfunding project for Free RPG Day, although I understand that it's going to be just an adventure module of some sort instead of a full introductory game. I probably wouldn't be too optimistic about the impact of something like this myself (I would assume that if merely being free was the philosopher's stone needed for rpg revival, we'd have already seen it in this age of the Internet), but I'm far from omniscient, so hopefully this gets funded and we'll see how it goes!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390377">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP" title="JimLotFP"><img alt="JimLotFP" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimLotFP">JimLotFP</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390377/#Comment_390377" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-15T23:35:03+00:00" title="September 15, 2012 11:35PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apparently 6 publishers so far will be trying to crowdfund Free RPG Day material.

Because from my perspective, as a gamer if I knew kids who wanted to play games, I'd probably take a game I already own, and teach it to them. In the 80s D&amp;D wasn't a thing only sold is specialty shops and strange corners of bookstores, you could get it WAY more places.<br/><br/>And you had kids who really wanted to get into this sort of thing to! I hate to trot out the 'video games' argument, but there's some truth to it. I think there's still kids out there who'd like to play RPGs more than video games, but they're probably not in the majority. And a lot of the people who like roleplaying right now do it systemless in online forums, never touching a rulebook or dice.<br/><br/>Conversely, I don't think that this will mean games die out.

The base system for this game was first published back in 1997 as the W.H.A.T.? Customizable RPG. It was a tiny pamphlet game that had an SRP of $2.00. It is what ultimately gave us the idea for this. That little $2 game sold several thousand units through game and comic shops and all evidence pointed to the majority of its customers being younger teens. Its what they could easily afford. It led to a fair number of new RPGers, albeit on a much, much smaller scale.<br/><br/>The new Dark Realms is actually a merger of the old W.H.A.T.? system mechanics and elements of our other old RPG line, the Dark Realms RPG Universe. We took them both out of print  back in 2002 with the intent to bring out a unified game in 2004. A longer than originally planned for playtesting and a venture down the path of MMO computer game design somewhat derailed this project until now. But on the positive side of things, it means we've got a decade of playtesting behind of the new Dark Realms.<br/><br/>Also, while any simplified version of D&amp;D might seem useful for this, the reality is the only thing D&amp;D could really bring to the table for such a project is its name. Yes, all of us gamers have more familiarity with its system, but to the new player who has never played any RPG, that familiarity means nothing. The Dark Realms runs off a simple d6 mechanic for everything. Its very easy to grasp. Much of the early playtesting was organized through some play groups spawned through a local middle school in our area. Kids got this extraordinarily easily. Plus, and we think this is VERY important. The game runs off a D6. No other dice are needed. That means a potential new player, who has never gamed before, is given this book and wants to try and play with their friends,  doesn't need any other dice than a D6. Most families have Yatzee, Monopoly or something like that laying around to grab a D6 from. In the Detroit area, the ONLY stores carrying polyhedral dice are the game stores and a handful of comic shops. While they aren't difficult to find in our area, in other areas, some smaller towns may have no such shops whatsoever. Making a player seek out some specialty shop, either locally or online, to buy some strange dice they've never seen before is just another barrier to them trying role-playing for the first time.<br/><br/>Ryan Johnson<br/>Guild of Blades Publishing Group  -  <a href="http://www.guildofblades.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.guildofblades.com</a><br/>GOB Retail  -  <a href="http://www.gobretail.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gobretail.com</a><br/><br/>The Dark Realms RPG 1 Million Book Give-Away Kickstarter<br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/guildofblades/dark-realms-rpg-1-million-book-give-away" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/guildofblades/dark-realms-rpg-1-million-book-give-away</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa" title="Bad_Santa"><img alt="Bad_Santa" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://anvalisok.com/cthulhu.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bad_Santa">Bad_Santa</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390421/#Comment_390421" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T10:47:09+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 10:47AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I would seriously suggest, though it might be too late since you've already started the kickstarter, is still making the SRP $1-2, but still distributing them for free in most places.<br/><br/>There's a psychological process that is different when something has a cost and when it is perceived as "free".  I think part of the success you saw with your previous product actually had something to do with this.<br/><br/>It's easier for retailers to push.  They're there to do business, not hand out free stuff.  Most retailers like having give-aways, but if they aren't tied to an event, they can get forgotten fairly quickly.  If you give them something free that they can turn around and sell for $1, they're going to push it a bit harder, it's much more likely to become part of their sales pitch of "what is an RPG" when someone new asks in the store.<br/><br/>The human brain also assigns a much higher value to things that have cost than when they are free.  A pamphlet that someone just hands you is okay to toss in the garbage or line a birdcage with.  A pamphlet you pay $1 for is way too expensive for either of those things.<br/><br/>In Africa, they're finding that when they charge a nominal fee for mosquito nets, more people are taking them.  The cost $6 to manufacture and another $6 to distribute, but they only charge $1 to the customer, but that nominal fee completely changes how the recipient feels about the net.  It's not charity, it's something they spent money on.<br/><br/>And there's still nothing stopping you from just handing out bundles for free to the library, schools or kids programs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390424/#Comment_390424" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T10:54:06+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 10:54AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To Captain_Thark<br/><br/>Distribution of the books is the most difficult part of this project and the most costly. Having them printed actually cost less. And when working in such large numbers, every avenue of potential distribution must be scrutinized from a cost perspective. <br/><br/>As a retailer who has role-playing games as the second strongest category in our store, that means we sell a LOT of RPGs. We have nearly 4,000 unique RPG titles on the shelves currently. I regularly get young teens and tweens that come into the store and who've read about D&amp;D or role-playing in general online, or been told about it by someone they know at school. They are interested in trying. That the interest is there is a tremendous first step.<br/><br/>Back in the early 80s, before there were video games, the internet and so many more options to attract a younger teens attention, it was easier to get players to take that next step. Spending money on a D&amp;D book, which was available nearly everywhere (hobby stores, Toys R Us, mass market department stores). And back then a single players guide for $15 could get you started.<br/><br/>These days, if looking at industry leading brands, you have either $50 for a Pathfinder core rules of $105 for the 3 core D&amp;D books. Thats a fairly high fiscal barrier for them to want to cross.<br/><br/>Perhas worse, each of those options involves hundreds of pages of reading before they can start to play. We live in the age of the smart phone and texting, where you average teen hardly ever reads or writes conplete words and sentences and we expect them to read 300-500 pages of text before they can even try out this whole role-playing thing? (I mean no disrepect to the many indie games that are infinitely shorter and likely much better entry points to role-playing than either Pathfinder or D&amp;D, but without an aggressive program to put those games in front of players...as we are attempting with the Dark Realms, then those potential new players have no idea those games exist).<br/><br/>A couple weeks ago I had parents come in and buy the D&amp;D players handbook and DM guide from me. They were buying them from a list of books their kid had sent them to come buy as the entry points to D&amp;D. Two days later they come in and return them stating there was no way their 12 year old was going to read all of that to get started. I took the exchange and sold them a few Dark Realms books and some dice.<br/><br/>The main barriers to entry, as we see them:<br/><br/>1) Interest. Curiosity. <br/>Without a massively larger market budget, there is not too much any small company can do to fuel curiosity or whip up interest. But thankfully, role-playing as a field is fairly mainstream today. But to many of the young teens, its presented more as MMO (world of Warcraft) and online chats, etc. The traditional table top that we know as role playing hasn't kept up. We are hoping that sticking a book in front of them thats quick to read and easy to learn, will give this broader audience of kids who have these other ideas of what role-playing is, a chance to try our version of role-playing for themselves.<br/><br/>2) Cost.<br/>As mentioned above, $50 to $105 or more is a LOT of money for a younger teen to spend (or a parent to spend on them) for a game they actually know if they'll like yet. This allows us to bring the cost factor down to zero.<br/><br/>3) Learning Curve.<br/>Kids read less today than they did back in the early 80s. Not that kids ever read a LOT, but these days, they are most confortable reading text messages and short hand on chat than actual books. The Dark Realms brings the total game system down to 32 pages and some of that is setting, NPC examples and monsters in the back. So 20-25 pagesgets them started.<br/><br/>4) Dice.<br/>No poly dice needed to play this game. a d6 from one of their mass markety board games and they are off and playing.<br/><br/>So, that all being said, the "where" we distribute these has a bit less to do with their potential effectiveness than the fact the game and form have been designed to overcome those four substantial hurdles. We're playing to that fact that there already is some awareness and some curiosity out there among teens for this type of game and have striven to remove all the hurdles to actually trying it. So in many cases, getting these books into the hands of existing players and stores will actually open up many opportunities for them to be passed on to persons and kids with potential interest.<br/><br/>Overall, the current plan for distribution (a work in progress for which we are VERY open to hearing new ideas on how we can make it better) includes.<br/><br/>1) Distribution to our kickstarter contributors<br/>2) Distribution of bundles of books to persons at Gen Con, Dragon Con, San Diego Comic con.<br/>3) Distribution as give-away through smaller conventions, leaning some on shows with some cross over potential. Anime, comic cons, etc.<br/>4) Distribution through game and comic stores.<br/>5) Libraries<br/>6) Boys and Girls Clubs<br/>7) Active Dity Military Personnel (so they can share with others among them that don't game yet).<br/>8) An experiment: Every house mailing to a zip code with nearby access to a game store for add-on support.<br/><br/>More ideas welcome.<br/><br/>Ryan Johnson<br/>Guild of Blades Publishing Group  -  <a href="http://www.guildofblades.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.guildofblades.com</a><br/>GOB Retail  -  <a href="http://www.gobretail.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gobretail.com</a><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Dark Realms RPG 1 Million Book Give-Away Kickstarter<br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/guildofblades/dark-realms-rpg-1-million-book-give-away" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/guildofblades/dark-realms-rpg-1-million-book-give-away</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390425">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades" title="guildofblades"><img alt="guildofblades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/guildofblades">guildofblades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390425/#Comment_390425" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T11:02:05+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 11:02AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Bad Santa,<br/><br/>You are probably right. However, many of these venues will have to find their own approach to how giving them away will work for them. These give-away books won't have any pricing listed on them. So if stores or libraries want to put a $1 sticker on them and then give them away (or sell them, I guess, if they feel that will actually work for them), then they will be free to do so.<br/><br/>As for the retailers, we give them good trade terms and have a multitude of low priced supplements (SRP $7.95), character sheets and a forthcoming world campaignbox set (just $29.95) in the works that will all be available by the time the give-away edition can see print. They've got lots of ways to monetize the giving away of the core rule book. And who knows, some of the people who try and like the game might want the nice quality commercial core rule book also..its only $12.95. I worry more about retailers even bothering to attempt to give them away only the simple basis its not D&amp;D or Pathfinder. We're hoping that the large scale of this give-away will ease their concerns and realize with this many copies moving into the market, there will be at least some conversions there for them to be able to service afterwards.<br/><br/>Ryan Johnson<br/>Guild of Blades Publishing Group  -  <a href="http://www.guildofblades.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.guildofblades.com</a><br/><br/>GOB Retail  -  <a href="http://www.gobretail.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.gobretail.com</a><br/><br/><br/><br/>The Dark Realms RPG 1 Million Book Give-Away Kickstarter<br/><br/><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/guildofblades/dark-realms-rpg-1-million-book-give-away" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/guildofblades/dark-realms-rpg-1-million-book-give-away</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre" title="Jason_Pitre"><img alt="Jason_Pitre" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/963/nF2ZB6ZWC4SFX.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Pitre">Jason_Pitre</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390426/#Comment_390426" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T11:11:05+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 11:11AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My main concern is that the game is labeled "Adventure Game" rather than "Roleplaying Game" or "Storytelling Games", which means that it will be harder for newcommers to get more information about the hobby.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390427">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390427/#Comment_390427" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T11:13:39+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 11:13AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 11:15AM by snej.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>In the 80s D&amp;D wasn't a thing only sold is specialty shops and strange corners of bookstores, you could get it WAY more places.</blockquote>\nReally? I started playing D&amp;D in 1979 and the only places I knew that carried it were "hobby shops". And I lived in the SF Bay Area, not out in the sticks. Nowadays it's available at all the major bookstore chains, and quite visibly \u2014 Barnes &amp; Noble usually has an RPG display in between the SF/Fantasy and Graphic Novel sections.<br/><br/>(Maybe D&amp;D got wider distribution later in the '80s after I stopped playing? My experience pretty much ended when I went to college in late '82.)\n<blockquote>And you had kids who really wanted to get into this sort of thing to! I hate to trot out the 'video games' argument, but there's some truth to it. I think there's still kids out there who'd like to play RPGs more than video games, but they're probably not in the majority.</blockquote>\nI partly agree, but it goes both ways. Yes, there is a lot more competition from video games these days; but there is also much, much, much less stigma attached to geeky pursuits like games, fantasy, SF, and anything you have to use math for. I don't know if you were around back then, but if you had asked "normal" kids to play anything involving elves or magic or adding up dice they would have laughed like crazy and then stuffed you headfirst into a trash can.\n<blockquote>And a lot of the people who like roleplaying right now do it systemless in online forums, never touching a rulebook or dice.</blockquote>\nYes \u2014 I think the biggest area for market expansion is the kids who <i>aren't</i> already into RPG video games. It's hard to compete with the visceral immediacy of big-screen 3D animation, or at least I think you have to give kids a while to immerse themselves in it before they realize the limitations and start to look for something more open-ended. <br/><br/>But I think there are a lot of imaginative kids (particularly girls) who like made-up worlds and coming up with stories, but who are not turned on by stats and min-maxing and the whole "kill monsters and take their stuff" attitude. Online RP forums and fanfic are both heavily girl-dominated and that energy could so easily funnel into full RPGs \u2014 I just think these kids don't think they like RPGs because they associate them with WoW and D&amp;D and Diablo, i.e. spiky armor and chainmail bikinis and six-foot swords.<br/><br/>This would argue for NOT reaching out using a traditional "fantasy heartbreaker" system, whether it's OSR or something comparable (as this one seems to be?) but rather something more like a, yes, story-game. Note that the Tabletop series, which is having huge success exposing modern board games to a larger audience, picked Fiasco as their token RPG so far, not Pathfinder or OSRIC or anything elfy-dwarfy-dicey.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_390434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/snej" title="snej"><img alt="snej" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://mooseyard.com/JensStuff/Self-portrait%20with%20hat%2032.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/snej">snej</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390434/#Comment_390434" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T12:00:06+00:00" title="September 16, 2012 12:00PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I took a look at the <a href="http://www.guildofblades.com/images/DarkrealmsWebPDF.pdf" rel="nofollow">PDF</a>, and to be honest it's not very exciting. It's clearly inspired by early D&amp;D but doesn't really add anything to it \u2014\xa0the mechanics are a bit different but not necessarily for the good. For example, rolling <i>one d6</i> for a stat gives you a flat distribution between terrible and awesome instead of a bell curve, which is unrealistic and will lead to characters with extreme attributes at both ends of the scale. (Also, rolling stats instead of choosing them isn't usually done anymore \u2014 except in deliberately "retro" games \u2014 because it tends to be a buzz-kill for people who have a character in mind and want to play that character, instead of going with someone randomly generated.) <br/><br/>Beyond the mechanics, the layout and design are really limited and it's full of intimidating tables of tiny numbers. It looks like a low-budget 1980s RPG. Compare this to other free fantasy RPGs like <a href="http://www.dungeonslayers.com" rel="nofollow">Dungeonslayers</a> or <a href="http://www.oldschoolhack.net" rel="nofollow">Old School Hack</a> and it's no comparison \u2014 if you're trying to get newbies to pick something up, they're much more attractive and approachable.<br/><br/>I don't think you're going to have much luck with this, honestly, because people hearing about the Kickstarter don't know the system and aren't going to be bowled over by reading about it. You'd be a lot better off picking one of the excellent existing free lightweight systems and printing that. Some of them have open licenses that already allow it, and with others you'd have to get permission but I'm sure any developer of a free game would be happy to see a zillion copies printed.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_390438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/390438/#Comment_390438" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-16T13:13:28+00:00" title="September 16, 2012  1:13PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 16, 2012 1:14PM by Hans_c-o.">edited September 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><br/>Beyond the mechanics, the layout and design are really limited and it's full of intimidating tables of tiny numbers.

The game might be cool (I just flipped through to look at the layout), but what kid is going to pick this up, with that cover, and go, "Cool! This looks <i>awesome</i>!"

However, many of these venues will have to find their own approach to how giving them away will work for them. These give-away books won't have any pricing listed on them. So if stores or libraries want to put a $1 sticker on them and then give them away (or sell them, I guess, if they feel that will actually work for them), then they will be free to do so.</blockquote>\nYup, the reverse is just as true, especially if you charge them nothing and tell them your preferred method is to give away free.  It's easier to justify giving something with a SRP $1 away for free than it is to charge $1 for something with an SRP of $0.  Especially to the consumer.<br/><br/>An analogy would be water.  Ask someone to pay for tap water and they'll look at you like you're crazy.  Hand them a bottle of Evian for free and they'll thank you.  Adding a price tag of $1-2 (without actually charging anything to the recipient) and you change how your pamphlet is regarded.  In the mind of most people, you'll have increased the perceived value of it, making it more likely of a positive outcome.<br/><br/>With an increased perceived value, people are more likely to pay attention to it and read it.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to encourage you to monetize this.  Just offering up a suggestion, based on evidence I've seen from a wide variety of sources, from retailers, to NGO's to my own personal consumer habits of throwing free stuff I find in my shopping bags into the garbage all the time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
