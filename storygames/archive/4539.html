The thread is here: http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=4503<br/>\n<br/>\nI've seen this conversation coming off on the horizon for a long time now. Lots of "story games" have mechanics that, if played "selfishly" may not work precisely as intended. The question of whether or not you can have a cooperative "game" is an interesting one. Perhaps these are not "games" but something else. And unless you see that context, it may be impossible see how Game Theory supports these mechanics working. <br/>\n<br/>\nAssuming they do. I'm going to play devil's advocate here quite a bit. Please understand the following in that light, and try not to let the more potentially incendiary parts of this ignite. Consider it rationally. <br/>\n<br/>\nEven with a liberal understanding of how Altruism works in Game Theory, it's contentious as to whether certain sorts of mechanics can incentivize thematic play, when the potential for Gamism exists. That is, if we have measures in a game, won't players tend to see these as something to measure themselves against? And, if that's the case, won't they fail to function as intended in certain cases? <br/>\n<br/>\nThe classic example that I can think of is Bonus Dice from Sorcerer. Ron will maintain steadfastly that they promote narrativism, and not a clawing to get them to succeed in Gamism fashion. But, the argument goes, if the reward of getting bonus dice is character success, then for it to be a reward, the player has to be invested in character success. And if the character is simply being authored by a player who is as interested in character failure as success for dramatic reasons, why would he be invested in the character coming out on top? If not to prove their own prowess somehow? <br/>\n<br/>\nHow are bonus dice different than, say, situational bonuses in any other game? Well, the first difference is what they are rewarded for. And that's cool narration, according to the rules. As opposed to situational bonuses which are either rewards for good tactical play, or simply simulative. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut doesn't this, at the very least, create a conflict in the Creative Agenda, with one side of the equation pointing to narrativism, and the other to gamism? Ron will point and say, look at the actual play. No gamism going on there. In the context of the entire game (which cannot be ignored) the mechanism in question works as designed. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd from what I've seen I'd be forced to agree. But here's where things get really potentially flamey, so please bear with me. <br/>\n<br/>\nAn argument here could be something like, "Well, the utility of being a member of the Forgies to those who are is higher than playing these games honestly and letting them break down." That is we can ignore the in-game factors, because social factors that outweigh them. We play against our self-interest in the game, for the larger self-interest of acceptibility in the community in question. Or, perhaps, the games aren't working at all, and we're lying about the reports of success to gain this social acceptibility. <br/>\n<br/>\nLess contentious is that we've just subconsciously decided to play a particular way that we're expecting the rules to produce, and getting the result despite them. We have to consider this possibility, because we often claim that's exactly what's going on when players tell us that the game didn't work for them as designed. "Oh, you're playing with pre-concieved notions of how the game should work... set those aside, and it'll work fine." Well, don't we, too, have preconcieved notions of how these games should work? For Sorcerer, isn't it all of Ron's work explaining to everyone how it should work? <br/>\n<br/>\nAs for our play with others outside of the social network, or of an understanding of "how it's supposed to work" aren't we simply transmitting that to them in play via techniques? If you run a game, and expect that it'll go like X, won't that tend to make that happen, system or no? <br/>\n<br/>\nSo there are two general questions, really:<br/>\n1. Are systems actually doing a lot to produce the sort of play they're intended to, or do they tend to just produce what we expect them to produce, using techniques not specified by the system in question to get the sort of play we're expecting? To what extent do they reliably produce certain sorts of play? I asked this question on the Forge a while back, and I think I stated it badly. <br/>\n2. To the extent that mechanics can produce expected behaviors, shouldn't we expect the mechanics to do more or less as Game Theory would predict? Or are those models simply too simplistic for the actualities of play? Given that RPGs are about fictions, are the benefits of play the same sorts that exist when there's no fiction being created? Are the rewards (can they be) substantively different from those in another sort of game, such that we can be incentivized toward them? And, if so, how do we make that distinction function without it the incentives being confused for the ones from traditional games? <br/>\n<br/>\nGiven that Game Theory does take altruism into account, perhaps it's possible to actually make mechanics where other values than display of tactical prowess are rewarded. Certainly such rewards exist; I have a friend doing psychology research into such things as how good storytelling ability makes one more attractive as a mate (so, oobviously, it's not only tactical ability that gives us life rewards towards pur essential instincts). <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, again, that means that we're seeing that the people playing will have one or more of multiple reward demands from a game. If they come to a game with a particular demand, won't the mechanisms of the game work differently for those players? Again, if Narrativism supporting games only work for people who want Narrativism... then how do we know that it's the mechanisms of the system that are causing the behavior? As opposed to the drives of the individual playing? To what extent? <br/>\n<br/>\nIs there any way to objectively test? It would first require understanding a player's biases? <br/>\n<br/>\nActually this seems to be precisely what System Does Matter says, systems don't create behavior, they simply support particular behaviors. It admits that one can play a system that's well designed to support one mode, using another mode, and that this happens. And then the tool analogy comes in: you can use a tool that's poorly constructed for a particular sort of play, but why would you want to do so? <br/>\n<br/>\nBut that's the point here... if in fact systems do not create behavior patterns, then we can't say that Game Theory is at all at work here, correct? And if that's not applicable, then what are we left with to discuss just what a particular system does? <br/>\n<br/>\nIt seems to me we go around and around. We claim we can make better games using the right mechanisms, then we discuss what they promote, but then we point out that we're not creating behavior, but supporting it. So... what's the calculus of "support"? See if you can try to answer that question without delving into "Well X gets in the way, so we get rid of that." How is Y supporting the sort of play that we want to see? If not in a way explained by Game Theory? <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm sure that this is probably way too abstruse (despite me fighting, believe it or not, to make it as accessible as I can), but I think that there's an issue in here somewhere worth discussing, and I hope I'm not the only one who sees it. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102676">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ru_Baraba_Dom" title="Ru_Baraba_Dom"><img alt="Ru_Baraba_Dom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/559/n1DT8PKZTUJ28.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ru_Baraba_Dom">Ru_Baraba_Dom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102676/#Comment_102676" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T08:55:15+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  8:55AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2007 8:57AM by Ru_Baraba_Dom.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You're asking a lot of questions, but here's my two cents on the issue, coming from a pretty gamist perspective.  Take <i>Dogs in the Vineyard</i>, which I played long before I started thinking about "story-games" and collaborative gaming.<br/><br/>I didn't understand a lot of the system when I started.  I came to the game and saw that I had all of the little bonuses with die values attached.  Big gun, sharp-shooter, etc.  These are designed to promote narrativist gameplay, since you can only bring in your bonuses if you can narrate them into the story.  So for me, the game became "how can I involve X item on my character sheet in this conflict so that I can win."  The fallout associated could always be rolled back into more little dice, so it didn't seem to matter if I dragged in all my dice through a convoluted narrative.<br/><br/>And it wasn't a satisfying way to play.  The fact that the game could be... well... "gamed" didn't mean it could be done in a way that was at all satisfying to a gamist (ie me).  I actually really didn't enjoy it, although I didn't want to say it to all my friends (that did spend a lot of time talking game theory and checking out indie games and such) since they thought it was the bee's knees.  I knew I was getting something wrong, and I kind of wanted to play it again, if only to figure out how they were enjoying something that was so absolutely dull.<br/><br/>So much to say this: a story-game can be abused in this fashion if they just don't "get" the story-game perspective, and it will be lousy.  Just because a mechanic allows, or even promotes a certain style of game play, that doesn't mean that it's how it will be played.  In the end, however, I wonder how many of the gamists will adapt to a different game style by learning to use the mechanics as intended (which involves some fairly abstract shifts in perspective) or just discard the game as unsuited to their native paradigm.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102688">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102688/#Comment_102688" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T09:26:52+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  9:26AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rewards. If you don't want the reward that the game offers, and pursue a different reward, the game doesn't "work." Players are very used to the idea that rules offer weak or contradictory reward cycles, that need to be overriden by a social-based or individually-supplied reward in order to play well. When faced with a game that <i>does</i> provide a reward system that supports a particular kind of play effectively, many players either can't seem to notice it unless it's shoved in their faces mechanically (and it may come across as constraining) or it becomes obtrusive by its failure - the game does not deliver fun. They'll continue to play with whatever socially-mediated reward schema they're used to: for many groups, a sort of brute Gamism of tactical victory over situation, for others, a devotion to exploration-for-its-own-sake.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102691">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102691/#Comment_102691" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T09:33:37+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  9:33AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2007 9:35AM by TonyLB.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think Game Theory is a perfectly fine tool for analyzing games with thematic elements, etc., etc., etc. ... <i>as far as it goes</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nGame theory really has no problem whatsoever with handling things like thematics.  If you get X amount of utility from addressing a premise ... that's measurable.  It's fine.  It's no big deal.  Game theory handles games where people aim to lose, or where they aim to break the experience of playing the game ... all that stuff.  It's just curiosities.  It doesn't break the assumptions of the math.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut, unless you delve quite deeply indeed into game theory, the tools you're bringing to the table probably <b>do</b> have a few in-built assumptions:  the primary one being that people know what they want, and that what they want does not evolve over the course of (and as a result of) the game.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor checkers, or chess, or go ... that's a solid assumption.  Measure of victory is, in fact, in-built into the game.  But even when you have people pursuing something other than the in-built strategy (i.e. a Washington Square chess player who disproportionately values moves that shake up the board and intimidate his opponent), if those tactics are <i>static</i> then you can create a measure for them ("A sudden gasp and the loss of blood from my opponent's face is worth half a pawn in positional value") and apply pretty standard game-theory to analyze what strategies that will lead people toward.<br/>\n<br/>\nGame theory becomes far more complicated when you remove that assumption:  When you assume, contrariwise, that people will change their value-sets mid-stream, and that those changes can and will be motivated by other factors at the gaming table.  When our chess-shark isn't just valuing <i>shock</i>, he's wisely calculating that he can rewire his opponent's goals and values (by making him more cautious, making him over-value conservative structure and retaining materiel) and benefit from that.  That gets heavily recursive very, very quickly.  It can still be expressed with math, but it's <i>very complicated math</i>.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt becomes a step <i>more</i> complicated when you assume that people will derive value from the mere act of causing someone else to change their goals and values, even if that change has no other benefit.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt becomes yet another step <i>more</i> complicated when you assume that people will derive value from the experience of having their values change.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou can easily end up with a twenty page set of equations and corrolaries, all to describe the content of an actual play fragment like "And then I just knew that I couldn't try to kill him any more.  Something had crossed over in my guy, something he'd been driving toward for a long time without knowing it.  I love when that happens."<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally don't think that the twenty pages of equations is always the best way to approach that actual play.  Sometimes the best way to discuss desires and feelings and principles is in the nuanced, imprecise, fuzzy, information-rich language that was made for them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102698">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102698/#Comment_102698" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T10:03:24+00:00" title="October 12, 2007 10:03AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 12, 2007 10:16AM by Burr.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can measure the success of a system by how reliably it creates certain behaviors that are well suited to at least one particular mode of play.

Given that the mechanism in question might be buried in a relatively complex system of other rules, to say nothing of the vageries of human behavior that you point out. Leave the math behind for a minute. Can we make mechanisms that work, starting from any beliefs in what mechanisms that exist promote or support? <br>\n<br>\nMark, I agree with what you're saying. But is the conclusion that any tight reward cycle is better than a confusing one? In any case, how do we know the one we've developed is tight, prior to playtesting? <br>\n<br>\nDavid, thanks for that data point. I find it pretty common, and why I'm asking the quesitions that I'm asking. <br>\n<br>\nThere's a corallary here, too. If the mechanisms we're using aren't neccessarily having the effects that we desire, then are there more potent ones that we can use? My Life With Master seems to be a very potent set of rules in how it limits what players can do, mechanically, down to a very narrow set of selections.

From my studies of game theory as a math undergrad in college, the big challenge in using game theory as a model for anything was defining payoffs.  By defining payoffs in various ways you can obtain very different results from otherwise identical models.  <br/><br/>If we have a game in which various choices of the various participants distribute red and green jellybeans, there are extremely different results if you put that game in front of a population that likes red jellybeans versus one that likes green jellybeans versus one that likes lots of jellybeans versus one that likes getting 9 jellybeans versus one that hates red jellybeans.  Since game design takes place in an environment where you know nothing, or perhaps less than nothing (given rampant misreporting, Tigger-ism, and simple lack of motivation to introspect), about the preferences of the people who will one day play it, game theory is extremely difficult to apply with any degree of meaningfulness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Burr" title="Burr"><img alt="Burr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Burr">Burr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102716/#Comment_102716" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T10:47:00+00:00" title="October 12, 2007 10:47AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Jarod, you're firmly of the belief, then that both can be accomplished, and regularly are?

Something had crossed over in my guy, something he'd been driving toward for a long time without knowing it.  I love when that happens."</blockquote>\nYou can also do hundreds of pages of math on computing the path of a projectile through a fluid based on it's angular velocity relative to a moving point.  But outfielders catch fly balls all the time without picking up a pencil.  Understanding the math behind game theory is useful, but it's useful as a way of learning the principles, as far as RPG design goes.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite></blockquote>+1 what?  +1 Laugh?  +1 XP?  +1 Adversity?  +1 Sadness?  If it's something that translates into value for them then yes, they'll tend to pursue it.  But that's the rub, isn't it?<br/><br/>And that was the chord that Mike's post struck with me.  The claim is that +1 Bonus Die encourages better narration, and that the crucial assertion that's unstated and unquestioned is that players will consistently value character effectiveness in a way that encourages narration.  <br/><br/>My own experience is that the part of my brain that values that extra die and the part that describes things well aren't very close, and situations where the one values incentives for the other are like driving in stop and go traffic: frequent gear-shifting.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>What I think we see so far is that designers leverage selection-bias ... Even that breaks down ("I'm playing because my friend asked me ... boy, this sucks,") but it's the technique I've seen a lot of people go to.</blockquote>\nWhich strikes me as a real problem.  I'm tempted to say that leveraging selection-bias leads to Designer Not Included.  At best, it's a more diffuse variant: Community Not Included.  <br/><br/>And, it's not the only approach I've seen.  I know that I'm biased myself, but my internal experience of TSoY's Keys marries incentive and behavior really well, for instance.  I think it's because the reward immediately follows the action, as opposed to being mediated through the GM.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>2. To the extent that mechanics can produce expected behaviors, shouldn't we expect the mechanics to do more or less as Game Theory would predict? Or are those models simply too simplistic for the actualities of play? Given that RPGs are about fictions, are the benefits of play the same sorts that exist when there's no fiction being created? Are the rewards (can they be) substantively different from those in another sort of game, such that we can be incentivized toward them? And, if so, how do we make that distinction function without it the incentives being confused for the ones from traditional games?<br/></blockquote>\nSo, summing up: my answer to this question is that, yes, we can usefully apply game theory, but that the levels at which RPGs function are such that it's likely impossible to do any hard an fast math.  Players intuit their rewards from play, and designers need to intuit their expectations.  I think that the payoffs of an RP game are a superset of other kinds of games - quite possibly because otherwise they're not a game anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley" title="Max Higley"><img alt="Max Higley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img206.imageshack.us/img206/6435/aqalthumbky0xh3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Max%20Higley">Max Higley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102763/#Comment_102763" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T14:01:30+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  2:01PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My reading and my answers only:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>Jarod, you're firmly of the belief, then that both can be accomplished,</blockquote>\nYes.\n<blockquote>and regularly are?

It's called The Narrative Wall.  I coined this phrase during my nine town Dogs in the Vineyard run.  What I frequently found while GMing was that I would hit a place where there were plenty of mechanical options available to me to keep a conflict going but exercising them would be dishonest to how I felt about the state of the fiction and so I would Give.  <br/><br/>Most often, but not always, that would be how I felt about a character.  A player would raise with specific words or actions and I just new that hit the character right in their weak/soft spot and they'd cave.  Sometimes it would be something just so awesome I had to Give or shoot my own story aesthetic in the foot.<br/><br/>So I started thinking about other games.  In Primetime Adventures I spend budget as the Producer based on my personal investment in a conflict.  But I *could* just blow maximum budget every conflict but I don't because of The Narrative Wall.  All your stuff about Sorcerer is absolutely correct and it HEAVILY relies on The Narrative Wall.  (Side note: I don't think this is related to character success.  I prefer it when players are totally committed to their character's success and leave trying to make them fail to the role of the GM.  I greatly dislike it when players want to see their characters fail.  Its one thing to enjoy character fail as part of thematics, it's another to be invested in trying to make it happen and flip flopping back and forth mid-play.  This is a totally separate issue I feel from trying to "win.")<br/><br/>But that raises the question: How much, when designing, can you RELY on The Narrative Wall, and how do you playtest that.  If someone where to play Dogs in the Vineyard and sociopathically just escalate every conflict to Gunplay just because they could I'd say they were missing the point of Dogs in the Vineyard.  Same goes for blowing budget in Primetime Adventures.  So, if I've designed a mechanic that I feel needs to be attached to the heartstrings of the player's commitment to the fiction to work, when I get playtest reports back how do I weed out, "No they didn't get it." from "No, this mechanic doesn't actually attach to the player's emotions they way I want it too."?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102796/#Comment_102796" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T15:16:50+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  3:16PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse - To make things worse, if you have players who don't attach any significance to anything in a game for the first few hours/sessions of play, you end up having to iterate your game in order to produce any results, and if you do that, you discover that if you play the same game multiple times, you get different results than just multiplying the effects of a single play.<br/><br/>"Sometimes the more you look, the less you really know."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102808/#Comment_102808" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T15:34:00+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  3:34PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>How much, when designing, can you RELY on The Narrative Wall, and how do you playtest that.</blockquote>\nMy strong design aesthetic is: "not at all."

My problem was that I was too used to running Sim-ish games, and my players too used to playing them. So I was more used to sitting back and asking them what they did next, rather than actively framing a scene that would reveal more about the town and ask them an interesting question. And they were inclined to play the game like it was some kind of CoC investigation - they wanted to work out what was going on in the town and *then* initiate a conflict. Not initiate one to find out. Needless to say, just like David's unsuccessful attempt at Gamist Dogs, this is No Damn Fun. The game does not support these behaviours well at all. <br/><br/>So my experience of Dogs is that everyone *does* bring their own assumptions to the table, and that "supporting" its CA is very much a matter of blocking other possibilities until the lightbulb goes on. Helped by Vincent's excellent text, of course. (Though what is that "a' tall" thing about?? Bugs me.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>"Oh, you're playing with pre-concieved notions of how the game should work... set those aside, and it'll work fine." Well, don't we, too, have preconcieved notions of how these games should work?</blockquote> Yes. I think that's very true.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Because the mechanics of Dogs don't need anyone to be playing to a "Narrative Wall."</blockquote>Well, I disagree. But I don't think that the game *assumes* it either. It works because Vincent is at great pains to explain how the mechanics are supposed to be used.

This is because we can swap the specific flavour of utility easily when we reduce it to self-interest. Self-interest can express itself in theft or charity and all that is requires to maintain the integrity of the model is tweaking the folk description. That's why the system in the other thread is just as testable with torture/murder as it is with gift giving. It doesn't matter on whit whether or not something is "rational" in the folk sense of being the decent or reasonable thing to do in the context of a real-world narrative.<br/><br/>If your model doesn't work to increase utility among participants, in many cases you are left with an appeal to sentiment. "X allows you to do this, but you *ought* to do Y because the non-technical text tells you to."<br/><br/>Many of you are familiar with this line of reasoning. When it appears  in the form of something called "Rule Zero" or "The Golden Rule," a lot of you talk about how that sucks and is a sign of bad game design. When it appears that the system rewards behaviour contrary to its stated mode of play, it's called "incoherent." When this appears in a scenario it's called "railroading." When the GM takes matters into her hands to correct for it, we hear about "force."<br/><br/>If you want a system that does not provably manipulate utility in its simplest form (plastic self-interest) to support its subject matter, you want to make a further appeal to the folk psychology of gamers, maybe, or if you're more sophisticated, you can speculate based on the results of games that have been tested. Unfortunately, you can't apply this argument directly to an RPG because we can't perform rigorous experiments with them. But I don't think this is really as well thought out as just *making sure the system works in the first place.*<br/><br/>If you don't want to do that, then basically, you've identified yourself as a System Doesn't Matter gamer in possibly the purest form, because you're saying you don't really care about what the system does when stripped of its pretenses (though some may conceal this fact by arguing for an incoherent definition of "system" that includes them convincing the participants above games that they *ought* to play it as such and such).<br/><br/>If you do want to do that, the System Does Matter. You want to provide utility rewards for certain things and structure the fluff/instruction around giving those things a certain narrative feel. You want to make sure that those dice symbolize Altruism in *this* particular game.<br/><br/>Now there is altruism and punishment as separate things with their own characteristics and controversies, but I seriously doubt it's honest to invoke those things merely by pointing them out and then assuming your games will use them in specific ways, as opposed to some narrative flavour of plain old selfishness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102835/#Comment_102835" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T17:23:59+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  5:23PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Malcolm is saying is a little more specialized version of what I was saying - game theoretic analysis requires a definition of utility/payoff, and concocting what that payoff is will dictate your results as much or more as the game itself.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_102836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102836/#Comment_102836" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T17:27:11+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  5:27PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite><br/><cite>Posted By: Judson Lester</cite>Because the mechanics of Dogs don't need anyone to be playing to a "Narrative Wall."</blockquote>Well, I disagree.

And that IMO is the take-home lesson for game authors.<br/>Could you explain what you mean?  I'm parsing a <i>non sequitor.</i>  Jesse's talking about turning completely away from what makes most mechanical/strategic sense in service of his own narrative aesthetic.  That's not my thing, but it's cool, and I can even role play with Jesse without it bothering me.<br/><br/>But, in a lot of ways, Dogs plays very well without imposing any ideas about a dramatic structure on the game.  Play to the dice you've got, and you'll look back on the game and say "Oh, wow, I guess the Steward really was a mealy mouthed bastard.  But his wife!  She had a heart of stone, and a varment gun to match!"  So suggesting that Dogs is designed with Jesse's Narrative Wall in mind at all makes no sense to me.<br/><br/>To say that Dogs supports, assists and encourages narrative play is true.  Yes, if you try to drive it like it's AD&amp;D or CoC, it'll fall flat.  But you can let the system do its part in telling a story, too.<br/><br/>I completely agree that a lot of indie texts could stand to follow Vincent's model of explaining his purposes really really well.  (Even the ashcan of <i>Poison'd</i> is super clear - in only 25 pages!)  But also, nowhere does Dogs rely on the incentive to tell a good story being telling a good story.  And that's also an example a lot of indie games could stand to look to.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_102837">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/102837/#Comment_102837" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-12T17:27:46+00:00" title="October 12, 2007  5:27PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to bed, but I'd like to use an allegory.<br/><br/>On a beautiful day, a group of people decide to go boating. There are two boats. One of them is a sturdy, dirty boat with few creature comforts, but it has working oars and stays steady on the water. You could probably take it anywhere, but you might catch cold in bad weather. The other boat is a thing of beauty. It has an adjustable canopy, is covered in stained, polished mahogany and is etched with vivid, imagination-inspiring depictions of the pleasures of boating by day. It also has a gilt bucket and a leak that's been artfully included to go with the grain of the wood. Engravings explain that you are *meant* to use the bucket to bail out the boat, to keep it going without marring its aesthetic qualities with a patch.<br/><br/>What boat do these people take? There's no right answer. But one boat still has a leak, and the other one is still ugly.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103113">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103113/#Comment_103113" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T14:10:42+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  2:10PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Not sure your point, Malcolm. Is it that either boat is sufficient? Or that it doesn't matter? Or that we should try to make beautiful boats with no leaks? Is that possible, if we're talking RPGs and not games. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf your message is, as JD contends (and I think Dave agrees), that it's important to have a goal in design, and to shoot for that, I don't know anyone who could disagree. The question is whether or not some goals can be achieved through mechanisms that promote X or Y. Are some goals simply not promotable that way? Are there games that try to promote narrativism goals that aren't actually doing so? <br/>\n<br/>\nAre most attempts to have a goal of a clear agenda going to actually be about disempowering the other agenda, like Dave talks about DitV doing, and then allowing people's agendas to take over. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf that's the case, then it would seem to me that every RPG is a case of training wheels on the way to playing freeform. At least for narrativism. Don't they have to do something in a positivist sense? And don't they? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103117">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103117/#Comment_103117" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T14:56:46+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  2:56PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's that people will develop play relationships with systems that are not necessarily related to the intended design. Some people get into a boat they don't really want to use as intended. This is not necessarily because the boat is badly built or the designer explains things badly. <br/><br/>The fact is, people have complex relationships with RPGs. I think theory often promotes a certain rhetorical trap with agendas. You describe your agenda, enter into a social contract and so on, but people do not have relationships with games that can be reduced to social contracts that define what they will derive utility from. The subtext, of course, is that if you freely agree to these things and there's still a poblem, the designer can wash his/her hands of being to blame. <br/><br/>But the designer cannot reliably demand adherence to an agenda. People don't have hardwired patterns by which they derive utility from any kind of fiction.<br/><br/>This kind of reminds me of my prof's response to Pascal's Wager: "What if God exists, but punishes people for believing in Him?" People approach games with perversity as well as reason. This is not always negative, as these contrarian relationships often lead to good play.<br/><br/>The best thing we can do is define what we're making when we design a game and fulfill that definition. Creative agenda doesn't really matter at this stage. All that matters is (from a game theory perspective) whether we design it to deliver straightforward rewards (the ugly boat), or inspire the group to develop its own utility game based on the situations generated by the system (the leaky boat).<br/><br/>Then players will do whatever they want.<br/><br/>I think this last thing scares people a lot. In RPG theory, the solution has been to use language to take command of the player experience. Consider the theory definition of "Narrative," which is much, much more limited than the real thing, and even more limited than a "dramatic narrative." It's easier to design a game that fulfills RPG theory Nar goals than one that supports all the traits associated with true dramatic narratives -- things like immersion, for example.<br/><br/>Game theory allows us to design without relying on sentimental signifiers (Humanity, Violence, Evil) so that player perversity is possible. Without that, it's still possible, but requires more robust support in the non-technical text -- "the gilded bucket." Some people find that *more* satisfying, in fact.<br/><br/>Here's an idea: Gamers *love* to strip a setting of system, but why not do it the other way around? I don't mean GURPS. GURPS talks about Strength and Guns and things. See how a system works as a pure mathematical object driven by unvarnished self-interest and ask yourself how many manifestations of that self-interest you want to support.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103121/#Comment_103121" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-15T15:35:17+00:00" title="October 15, 2007  3:35PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Malcolm Sheppard</cite>Gamers *love* to strip a setting of system, but why not do it the other way around?

No doubt there are alternatives, and I see your approach of "let the dice fall where they may and we'll rationalize it all later" as mostly working. And yet... I still feel that Jesse "conscience" is needed somewhere, if only in terms of what you're prepared to allow as post-rationalization. Somewhere down the line, the human touch is still required, even if we can trust the game system a bit more than we might expect. Is that making any sense?

And I really need to get a bit more experience with DitV before I go making black and white statements. But I see Jesse's "wall" as a particular example of something more general. Yes, it's a bit strong to say that the game requires Jesse's approach. No doubt there are alternatives, and I see your approach of "let the dice fall where they may and we'll rationalize it all later" as mostly working. And yet... I still feel that Jesse "conscience" is needed somewhere, if only in terms of what you're prepared to allow as post-rationalization. Somewhere down the line, the human touch is still required, even if we can trust the game system a bit more than we might expect. Is that making any sense? It's not easy for me to talk about.</blockquote>\nIn that case we're <em>entirely</em> on the same page.  If nothing else, Dogs doesn't tell you anything about what actually in-fiction <em>happens</em> - just who's winning or losing.  What they were fighting over is completely human input.  And there's nothing the text can do to prevent players from attaching nonsensical outcomes to "win" or "lose" because, ultimately, that's by no means procedural.  I still think of an example of actual play out of Durham, where Jason said "if I win, the mobsters catch you." and Remi replied "and if I win, they shoot me in the stomach and kill my family."  But in a lot of ways, I think that looking at the dice, seeing that you will win this conflict, (barring escalations, or whatever) and giving because "that's what the character would do" is letting down the design of Dogs.

The option to Give IS part of the system and is a source of incredible thematic input.  Being backed into a moral and emotional wall where you feel compelled to Give or be dishonest with your feelings about the fiction is one of the major reason I play Dogs.<br/><br/>I'm not talking about "what the character would do" as some abstracted notion of cause-and-effect logic, I'm talking about the character as a direct window on my, me, Jesse Burneko's emotions as a co-author at the table.  There's no way I'm going to shoot a fifteen year old girl over *this*.  I could keep arguing but that would be to deny through my character the fundamental truth of what was just said to me.

Whether intentionally or unintentionally, your game will end up supporting one of these agendas better than the rest, or be ambiguous in it's support. Which will have an effect. <br/>\n<br/>\nI don't disagree that people will come to games with differing agendas. That is, in fact, the point of Creative Agenda. If, in fact, players come with varying agendas, and the game does nothing to get them on the same agenda, then their play will tend to be problematic - you'll essentially have a group of people involved in disparate activities, which often results in dissatisfaction on some players' parts. <br/>\n<br/>\nOn the other hand, if your argument is that game mechanics cannot alter a player's agenda, then that's one of the things that I'm hypothesizing here. I'm not sure that I'd agree that the solution is not to try to unify the agenda, but I might agree that it doesn't always bear fruit (or at least not as much as we'd like). This is what I'm testing here. <br/>\n<br/>\nTo try to continue with the boat analogy, yes, any player can approach any game as either the ugly boat, or the leaky boat, surely. But if I make it so that the boat looks to one player like the ugly boat, and to another like the leaky boat, then it's not likely to actually be very good at being either. The ugly boat will have leaks, and the leaky boat will be less beautiful than it could be. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf, on the other hand, I focus on making a very watertight boat, or one that's very pretty, then I will at least satisfy those people who want the one or the other. Further, the people who want the other may well decide that, for the nonce, what they're looking for may as well be what the boat best presents as. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow I could argue that the single good form is better than the ambiguous and not great for everybody form is better. But I don't have to do that, because I'm not really putting down that form. I'd argue that it's simply a design choice, whether to make the game focused on one thing or not. I mean a designer can choose to design for a very narrow group of people, if that's what he wants, right? Or is it mandatory to try to make the game as appealing to as wide a group of people as possible? It can even make marketing sense to appeal to a smaller group, given tough competition for the wider market. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut, again, I'm really not so much wondering whether it's a valid design choice to create a "story game" but more whether or not we have tools to design them well. Outside of the obvious one, which is playtesting. Pre-playtesting, can we know what's going to work? And, if so, how? If our assumption is that play is not going to be about player tactical challenge. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for GURPS, I've written essays that employ Game Theory pointing out problems with that system at it's root level.

If my character is offered the chance to realise a goal then doing so is a rewards, and if the system allows me to attempt that realisation then I am rewarded, even if I am not given an additional mechanical reward.<br/><br/>That's not to say the mechanical reward isn't also an important motivation for acting in a specific way, but the non mechanical one is too surely. What you need to do is to combine the examination of the story and mechanical rewards and say "if a player does the sorts of things I want my game to be about do they get a reward, story or mecahnical?" Then you can say if a course of play doesn't have sufficient story reward then maybe mechanical reward is needed in addition.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103281">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103281/#Comment_103281" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T12:25:04+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 12:25PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>With regard to what Jesse and Judson/Dave are debating, I'd be really interested to hear Vincent's ideas on what he intended.

And that strikes me as weird, and counter to the intent as I read it.  In fact, counter to one of the virtues that I see in the Dogs rules text.<br/><br/>Contrariwise, his later example speaks more of the escalate-or-give decision that Dogs presents within its resolution.  Every escalation is <i>de facto</i> a moral decision.  If you're telling a 14 year old that she's not really in love with the Steward, and she's holding her own, are you going to slap her?  Shoot her?  That's completely within the rules, and the system I understand.<br/><br/>And actually, that distinction strikes me as cogent.  My reading is that the decision to escalate is a decided goal of the designer in Dogs, and it's (I think, successfully) reinforced by the rules as presented.  Sure, in play the system might fall apart, but generally, I find, when you allow weak forms of escalation ("I fire my gun into the air!" easily introduces the pistol's dice, but isn't really an escalation to shooting).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103284/#Comment_103284" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T12:32:27+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 12:32PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judson: in that case, how does the GM ever win a conflict in the late game?<br/><br/>Sometimes you just have to have the winning raise.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103296/#Comment_103296" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T12:47:09+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 12:47PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2007 12:52PM by MJGraham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Game theory is only one form of reasoning and not a very good one at that.

My understanding from your examples is that the narrative wall is where the concerns of the fiction (and indeed, the player-internal, pre-Care-Baker ideas about the fiction (which is a whole other thing, and a place where I think I side with JBR)) trumps any mechanic strategic consideration.  The last (before conflict actually occurs, Jesse as the GM simply lets the Dogs execute several townspeople) is simply an instance of saying yes rather than rolling dice.<br/><br/>Where that leaves a sour taste in my mouth is that it rewards the players who can push the GM's buttons.  One of my personal favorite moments playing Dogs was being able to reply to a particularly impressive spoken raise (where, I, Judson wanted to give, because the player's presence was so forceful) with "dice?"  The reverse is true, too.  I really like the way that the interplay of dice provides a constraint on narration.  If I raise with 15, the narration of that raise and the see are going to be great.  Even if I narrate "She looks from him to you."  I put a really high value on what I see as a virtue of that ruleset, and the system I play with Dogs with celebrates it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, (again to paraphrase one of your examples) it sounds as if, in a game that you're running, if I've got two dice to rub together but a really impressive narration at a tense moment, I can win with a 3.  And, yes that within the rules, but it's a system I don't think I'd like very much.<br/><br/>To the point of this discussion though, what I think that illustrates, from a game theory perspective, (and to a limited degree, this addresses Marcus' "psychopaths" comment) is that we're playing a different (formal) game.  The payoffs are completely different.  In my ideal game of Dogs, cool narration is part of the payoff for the table (all the rewards go up by "Ooooo!"), but figures marginally as a strategy.  In yours, cool narration figures in the outcome of a conflict, so it has a significant role as a strategy.  I don't know what was in Vincent's mind when he designed Dogs, but as always the ruleset is only a part of the system, and it's the system at the table that can be closely analyzed in any case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103317">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham" title="MJGraham"><img alt="MJGraham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nEPVXFCEJAK2O.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MJGraham">MJGraham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103317/#Comment_103317" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T14:32:09+00:00" title="October 16, 2007  2:32PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2007 2:33PM by MJGraham.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Posted%20By%3A%20Mike%20Holmes">Posted By: Mike Holmes</a> wrote:</div>\n<div class="QuoteText">[Edited to note here that I cross-posted with Malcolm, somehow, despite the fifteen minute time difference... odd]<br/>\n<br/>\nMarcus, I don't think that any of what you cite invalidates the math involved.

"Why are they doing this?"<br><br>This leads us to examine - what else - that "ought" in scare quotes above, the crucial element, our idea of what the payoff is.

I think Dogs very explicitly is about what you are or are not willing to do in order to win. If you're playing a character that's willing to shoot your brother to stop him from drinking, ok. You win! But if you're not (and I'm typically playing "me" in Dogs), what do you do if he pushes things? It asks the question, "what is winning this conflict really worth?" Ultimately, Dogs can push you to the point where winning is easy but victory is impossible.

class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys,<br/>I mostly lurk here, but breaking out for a moment. The Dogs discussion is fascinating to me because I've been there and found that doing what Jesse suggests -- using the option to Give as a way of validating another player's input to the game -- provided the best moments of play for me, by far.<br/><br/>Here's a concrete example of exactly this from my Forge AP post in <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=23506.msg231712#msg231712" rel="nofollow">The End of the Dog in the Black Coat</a>:\n<blockquote><span style="color: #000000;">Think about it: we had just Judged that the Steward could redeem himself for his crimes, and if we had Judged it, it must have been the King's will. So this woman [who killed the Steward] had thwarted the King's will!<br/><br/>Sister Ellie [my character] immediately drew her guns, pronounced quick judgement on the woman ("it is the King's will that you must die for this"), and aimed to shoot. But Sister Marika (played by Iain) was completely against this judgement. And so began our coolest conflict of the campaign! No need to "set stakes" - the conflict was obviously <i>Does Sister Elspeth kill the woman?</i> After several raises and sees, Marika ended up taking a bullet for the woman, and was incapicitated both in the fiction - writhing around on the ground - and in game terms, since Iain was almost out of dice.<br/><br/>Then came the turning point. Iain pushed forward some lame dice - like two 3s or something - and had poor Marika quietly say "Don't try to be a good Dog. Just be a Dog."<br/><br/>That Raise had such an effect on me personally* that I found myself speechless, and through me Sister Ellie was too. I looked at the big pile of dice I had left and couldn't see any way to play them without invalidating the meaning in Iain's words. So I pushed my dice aside, and said the best two words in DitV: "I Give."<br/><br/>As experience fallout I added Iain's raise word for word as a 1d6 trait. I used it a lot later on, too.</span></blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kuma" title="Kuma"><img alt="Kuma" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/010/nUOBV5SCXNNTN.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kuma">Kuma</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103366/#Comment_103366" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T22:22:30+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 10:22PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 16, 2007 10:23PM by Kuma.">edited October 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that you have a couple of points dead on, but I want to interject something here.<br/><br/>First of all, game theory assumes that all actors are rational, and making decisions based on their best (economic) interest.  The difficulty comes in using a game theory analysis on the game as a whole instead of in discreet systems.  A rational decision in-game is not a rational decision in the wider context of the gamespace + the playspace, which is not necessarily the same thing as a rational decision based purely on the social environment of the game.  Secondly, the rationale of good storytelling is not the same as pragmatic, economic reality.  I don't know the extent to which you can apply game theory across the two spaces.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103370/#Comment_103370" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-16T23:25:34+00:00" title="October 16, 2007 11:25PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think people are having trouble with the degree of abstraction I'm talking about. Self-interest is not the same as the moral quality of "selfishness." Rational action in the sense I'm talking about is not "rational" in the folk sense of "Rational people eat food, 'cause otherwise they'll die." It's much more basic. It's about maximizing utility. Utility is essentially whatever floats your boat, as it were. It really doesn't matter what floats your boat. As I noted in Tony's thread, the "altriustic" dice-passing game can become the "sadistic animal torture" dice-passing game with no modification at all. When economists talk about the rational economic actor, they are using far *less* abstraction than I'm talking about.<br/><br/>At this level of abstraction it is basically impossible to act against one's self interest barring error or some phenomenon where the player isn't really making the decision. We simply say that people do what they want for whatever reason they want. Even external coercion is irrelevant at this stage, because we don't care if that determined how the player formulated that want.<br/><br/>We play for that abastraction and play with it. We see what's rewarding and what isn't. *Then* the sentimental, narrative elements  have a role to play.<br/><br/>They will indeed change what happens in the game. Fine by me. System Doesn't Matter, then. That's true. I'm sure it's painful for some people to get here by the intellectual route they expect will end with showing that it *does* matter, but in point of fact it shows that the raw system is a starting point for the manipulation of signs -- the precursor to the real game as it's played.<br/><br/>This is an acceptable outcome. It just hurts to read if you design games and like to take credit for other people's fun. I know I do. But at this level, I really don't care about that. I care about something doing what it's supposed to do, instead of trying to talk the players into doing the heavy lifting for me. After all, that very problem is what people use to condemn Vampire. If you don't want to look at the stripped gears and want to appeal to pure sentiment, and textual propaganda about how the game ought to be played, your game has *exactly* the same issues that are often identified with Vampire.<br/><br/>If we strip it down and add signifiers later we know exactly what the reward mechanisms are for playing with a rule elated to that signifier. Players can follow them or not -- their choice. When we insist on entangling our design decisions in narrative signifiers we don't necessarily know what's responsible for player actions. The players don't necessarily know, either. But we can *explain* how we attached signs to rewards and how we expect those processes to turn out in play and we can even give advice about manipulating those signs.<br/><br/>We also know about the strategic options of these "pure" games. We can't disguise the lack of choice with different narratives or by chucking a few dice on for stunting. It means that the dice-passing game, with only two options and some obvious optimal strategies, is exposed as New Clothes. It's naked; there aren't many choices inside the system. It begs for narrative to save it. But we can add templates/classes to the dice and all of the sudden, we have more choices to make.<br/><br/>(And of course, you playtest. One thing people forget about game theory is that it involves experiments.)<br/><br/>Once again, not everybody cares. Sometimes systems that come with few choices apart from of the narrative are faster and simply chuck a sign a certain way. WoD combat is like this. There are a few resource based strategies, but the idea is to just max out dice with them. D&amp;D has more complex options afforded by templating. Preferences vary, but once we take away interfering signs, we can see how the systems act in a petty straightforward way, desin accodingly and advise players that a game was put together to act like *this*, even though you'll go for *that.*                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103471">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103471/#Comment_103471" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T12:29:16+00:00" title="October 17, 2007 12:29PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>Judson: in that case, how does the GM ever win a conflict in the late game?<br/><br/>Sometimes you just have to have the winning raise.</blockquote>\nWhy does the GM have to win in the late game?  In some ways, I see the proto-NPCs as a pacing mechanism: the GM has huge flexibility of dice early in play with which to complicate things, but later on he's more constrained.  If that follows closely the Dogs understanding and judging the Town, they'll resolve nicely.  If they go off half cocked, the GM still has 3d8 and 2d10 in loose traits, you know?<br/><br/>Oh, that and demonic influence dice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103492">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103492/#Comment_103492" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-17T14:08:37+00:00" title="October 17, 2007  2:08PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Marcus, you're taking the arguments about the use of Game Theory to absurd points. Yes, I completely agree that if we did nothing but use Game Theory to decide how to make our games that this would be a problem. <br/>\n<br/>\nAre you saying that any time any Game Theory is used for any design that it will only be right in it's predictive power accidentally? If that is, in deed what you're saying then we'll have to agree to disagree. I think I could prove you wrong, but I'm just not that invested in it. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you're saying "Don't base the entire design off of nothing but Game Theory" then there's no real disagreement going on. That would definitely be a straw man. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_103656">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103656/#Comment_103656" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T09:11:52+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  9:11AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh I hope I haven't killed my own thread...<br/>\n<br/>\nAnyhow, Malcolm, your post was a bit difficult, but I'm sensing that it keeps coming down to some idea that there's some basis for how mechanics interact at a level below the "signifiers" that is constant, no matter what the signifiers. Or that we can't know what the nature of the actual "self-interest" is at that level, so we have to assume some base. <br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not getting that, however. The behavior we see with most games (in the general sense of the word game) is that players try to win. Probably because of some reason like that they're trying to show their relative superiority over the other players, to themselves, or whomever. The reason isn't really important, but that's the general behavior. Whatever "self-interest" is here, it seems to involve doing well tactically to reach whatever goal. <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd I think that's what you're assuming is the base behavior and why you ascribe to Game Theory as a way to predict the behavior of players. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if, for some portion of the populace, the game isn't about winning at all? Yes, they're still trying to show their relative superiority, perhaps, but not by showing how they can manipulate game mechanisms better than somebody else, but instead in terms of using those mechanisms to, for example, show how compassionate they are. <br/>\n<br/>\nIn fact, this happens with typical games all the time... I might throw a game of chess with my 6 year old because:<br/>\nA) It doesn't really prove anything if I win... I already know I can beat him if I want.<br/>\nB) It makes him feel good to win (even if he knows I threw the game, he knows I did it because I want him to feel good, and that makes him feel good). <br/>\n<br/>\nI like myself better for having thrown the game. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is just an example, and an example of, as you put it, "perversion" of the normal intent of such games. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut what if that's actually the point of a particular activity. Let's not call it a game right now, but look at another activity, telling stories. You don't do that activity to win... there's no competition going on. You do that activity to feel good at having told a good story, perhaps one that entertains, or enlightens the audience. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo can't people come to RPGs with this sort of motive? And, if so, aren't the assumptions about what constitutes Self-Interest in these cases different than those in the case of a game that's played to win? And, if that's so, don't we have to give different values to the elements of the Game Theory that we're doing the math upon? The excellent point that you make is that we do experiments to validate the game theory (called playtesting in RPG design), but what's interesting is that when we go back to adjust the math to account for what we've seen, often an important part of that is in terms of adjusting the values of the choices to reflect. For RPGs, for many players with many systems, I'd postulate that the Self-Interest value of being able to make a value statement of some sort is relatively high to any sort of Self-interest from proving oneself to be tactically superior.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat other form of self-interest is there, if it's not one of these two? OK, I think there may be more, but the point is that there is no "generic Self-Interest" that lies undefined and unknowable in the math. In the Prisoner's Dilemma, the values are placed on specific things like "Freedom" vs "Incarceration" as the form of Self-interest. So what's the form that you're proposing here that applies to all RPGs? <br/>\n<br/>\nI can't tell which is your point: that Game Theory doesn't do anything, or that it has to be about winning as the only form of Self-interest. OK, that's unfair, I suspect you mean some third thing; but what is it, and how does it vary from these two options? <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_103770">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard" title="Malcolm Sheppard"><img alt="Malcolm Sheppard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Sheppard">Malcolm Sheppard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/103770/#Comment_103770" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-18T19:55:48+00:00" title="October 18, 2007  7:55PM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite>Oh I hope I haven't killed my own thread...<br/><br/>Anyhow, Malcolm, your post was a bit difficult, but I'm sensing that it keeps coming down to some idea that there's some basis for how mechanics interact at a level below the "signifiers" that is constant, no matter what the signifiers.

That's it. If it's solid on that level, we move to the level of signs. After that, we can clearly explain how the system is intended to function. The players are not obligated to play with the game this way, but they *can* appaoch the system in an informed fashion. Compare to simply mixing it up from the get go and saying that, despite what the system outputs, one ought to play in such and such a fashion.\n<blockquote><br/>I'm not getting that, however.

This makes the game accessible to players too and shows us how much of the design is leaning on certain assumptions about the players. That's it.<br/><br/>In my own design, the combat system for Aeternal Legends had some problems because one set of players valued on kind of narrative, and the second liked another, and these manifested in pursuing certain strategies (multiple versus single actions). I was exposed to one group whre Defense was worthwhile, but in the other, it sucked. By removing the scenarios from the picture completely I was able to find a good solution.<br/><br/>Another example is the dice-passing game. As written the strategies are petty straightforward and simplistic; the system leans on the group by telling them they ought to be non-optimal if they want variety. But if we remove that we can make adjustments that allow for multiple working strategies for players with the same personal approaches (by adding templated dice, for instance). If our intention is to rely in players being non-optimal we should know that and say it instead of bullshitting around, or change the design.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4539/game-theory-and-story-games" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4539/game-theory-and-story-games" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4539/game-theory-and-story-games/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4539%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4539%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
