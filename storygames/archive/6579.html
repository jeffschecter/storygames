I had fun replying and thought it might be fun to discuss more...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n&gt; So I just thought I'd start thread asking people what they as a GM do<br/>\n&gt; in the first few games of a new campaign?  It seems to me that once a<br/>\n&gt; story is ongoing it becomes much much easier to get players invested<br/>\n&gt; in the action (even if said action is separate from any currently<br/>\n&gt; running plot lines), but getting that initial buy in can be difficult.<br/>\n&gt;<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nhmmm....  good question.  I suppose I have a few different answers.<br/>\nI like this question, so I thought I'd post my ideas and look for your ideas and/or feedback or questions from my notes...<br/>\n<br/>\nplease reply! <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n   1. #1.  first, I always note to the players that for sessions 1-3 they are allowed to change ANY aspect of their character if they don't feel it's working as they hoped.  This actually rarely occurs but it lets the players feel at ease for making characters not being so cut-in-stone.  By game session 4 everything "locks" at what the player's decided.<br/>\n<br/>\n   2. #2.  I always try to consider what the main theme of the SETTING we're playing in is.  I try then to make an opening encounter plan that quantifies that flavor in the best way possible.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   3. #3.  I follow this plan with adding in the main themes of what my overall plot plans are, trying to slip in some fun foreshadowing or ideas that will hint at possible plot directions. Many times this will allow me to watch/listen to the players and see if they like/react to the plot hint.  If so I know to expand and explore it.  If not, I might consider redeveloping the idea into whatever the players DID pick up on for the session.  <br/>\n<br/>\n   4. #4.  On that line of thinking... listening to the players is KEY at these beginning stages more than ever.  Paying attention to the character creation and things the players like trying with their new PC is huge in knowing what they want from the game.  For example - if a PC has loads of ability to swing and jump, that means I need to find spots for them to shine, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n   5. #5.  Overall, beyond starting the campaign out with a bang in the "style" and "flavor" areas... I also try to start the campaign off with a literal BANG with some action, some combat, or at the very very least a cool interesting situation that makes the players think or say "wow"...  Openings are like 1st impressions, you never get a second one - they need to be distinctive and memorable!<br/>\n<br/>\n   6. #6.  a part of this memorable opening (for me) is to set the style of my opening.  I'm a weird GM.  I think I'm the only GM that I've ever gamed with that does this but I ALWAYS plan an opening for each game I run.  Similar to the opening theme/credits for any TV show or movie I always develop an "opening" for every game.  The opening is the same ever week for each different game campaign.  Think of the "opening monologue" from Buffy or Star Trek.  I do that for every campaign.  Its the opening for each session of the campaign that sets the tone and immediately tells players to sit down, strap in because the game is ON!!  I do these in a variety of styles, again focusing as best I can on the style/theme of the game/campaign.  I'll usually have an "opening read" (monologue) that I read, always with the same theme music for the background.  I don't know if my players like it as much, but it really helps "switch" me into game mode.<br/>\n<br/>\n   7. #7.  PC descriptions...  These are always very important.  I almost always begin with going around the table and having each player describe the look and style of their PC.  I always write down their PC's name (along with the player name in parenthesis) on a wipe-board - this is both for me AND the other players to read/remember.  Nothing sinks players into a game MORE than EVERYONE calling characters by their in-character NAMES and not their class or player name.  I like using a wipe-board that I lean up for all to see, this is also a great place for initiative and any regular NPCs or animals, etc...<br/>\n<br/>\n   8. #8.  PC entrances...  similar to descriptions a cool thing I do sometimes is ask the player to think of or plan their character's "entrance" into the campaign.  Think about it... any 1st movie/show will almost always have some sort of interesting or dramatic reveal of the main characters.  Whether that be a situation or just a cool camera move to show them for the first time.  Big movie stars get this alot.  Watch the new Indy movie for example.  Harrison Ford is hinted at, then shown from above, then his hat, then his feet, then the shadow profile - THEN you get to finally see his face.  Let the players come up with a cool "entrance" for their PC... its fun!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146054">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146054/#Comment_146054" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T16:32:56+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  4:32PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2008 4:39PM by kevperrine.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            9. #9.  one big thing that leads to the opening of the campaign is listening to the players PRIOR to the campaign beginning.  I do several things to help me determine ideas for drawing the players in.  My favorite creation is the "3x3" -<br/>\n<br/>\n         1. 3x3:  I have each player create 3 "friends", 3 "contacts" and 3 "enemies".  These are simple NPC info that allows each player to add to the campaign before it starts with what they like and give the GM a LOAD of NPCs = 9x(the number of players)!!  Usually that's nearly 40-50 NPCs to look through.  The "rule" with this is that once they give these ideas to the GM they are NOT in the game until the GM brings them in, they are fully under the GMs control to add to or create based on a simple idea.  These are NOT characters that the PC "purchased", they're idea starters for the GM, totally the GMs NPCs after given.<br/>\n<br/>\n         2. Background:  everyone has their players write backgrounds... I highly suggest filtering them to mine for ideas.  I usually go through each with a highlighter, literally.  Looking for any points or NPCs or locations or drama, etc... that I can add into my plot.<br/>\n<br/>\n         3. 10 Questions:  one fun thing I've done is make up (no more than) ten questions for the player to answer IN-character as best possible.  I say no more than 10 because doing more usually over-whelms both the players and you as GM.  I used to give a questionnaire of 200 questions or more I'd developed... It was too much.  I usually focus these questions on helping the THEME of the campaign/setting, many times asking "leading" questions that will aid in the player understanding the setting better.  These also immiately give me ideas to add to the campaign.  I usually try to throw in questions that may help for future in-game use like:  What's your greatest desire? What would your character never do? What's your heroic motivation? etc... these are questions that can be used by your plots, villains or NPCs to push buttons dramatically later... WITHOUT "hinting" at the need for knowing that point later.  For example - if my "Mind Reader" wants to tempt a PC with his greatest desire, its more fun to drop it in without asking the player just prior...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  10. #10.  Keep Notes... I keep my notes on the campaign and add to the background as best I can then make sure to SHARE those notes with the players.  This keeps the game points and background in mind.  With that I always ALWAYS call NPCs by their names over and over again.  The point with all this is to help the players remember.  When one player remembers its infectious and more fun for everyone all around.  I tend to use online resources alot for this.  I create custom YAHOO GROUPS and WIKI pages for each campaign.  I set them up meticulously in the beginning to set the stage.  Its the little things that matter...  a little hard work on setting this up in the beginning WILL go a long long way for the opening game sessions as well as long term.  I use these are my "campaign bibles".  This is helpful for me as GM and offers the chance to read and check notes on for players...<br/>\n<br/>\n  11. #11.  In medias res (Latin for "into the middle of things") is the best way to start most campaigns.  You have to plan for multiple options and give the players the most control they can have after the opening, because by opening in this way you've already "taken away" a large portion of their choice from the start.  Its very important to note that in medias res doesn't always mean combat... sometimes a great mystery opening or sheer action is a great "encounter" to begin a campaign.  Again - whatever is most thematically memorable for the style of the campaign (see 1st Impressions above)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146055">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146055/#Comment_146055" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T16:33:20+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  4:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2008 4:39PM by kevperrine.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            12. #12.  Character Packet...  I happen to be able to make props and things quickly and easily since I have a graphic design background.  So I usually always put together some sort of "campaign packet".  Sometimes that's a folder or binder for each player with any handouts or prints of campaign world maps, setting rules, character sheets,  etc...  sometimes even new pencils or dice that I like to give to my players as a treat at character creation.  I also know (selfishly) if the players each have something to "start" with as a handout they're more likely to keep notes and do extra game fun stuff.  In the best situation this has prompted players to add to the packet or remake their own!  In the worst situations, players will leave/forget their packet...  When that happens it bums me out since I took time/effort/money to make it, but I never hold it against anyone. <br/>\n<br/>\n  13. #13.   Character Sheet Copies...  I enjoy having character sheets of all the players.  Usually I'll ask that players make character sheets digitally if that option is available, sometimes I'll scan their character sheets.  I generally like having the sheets digitally so no player will "forget" their sheet, which happens now and then.  Its easy then to download and print a new sheet this way.<br/>\n<br/>\n  14. #14.  I can't stress enough... I think player involvement is the MOST important aspect.  Don't tell YOUR story as GM.  Listen to the players and allow them to add to the game more than you add YOUR plot points up front.  I do this usually by having that opening "encounter" session be something that fits with the feel/flavor of the campaign - however isnot intricate to the MAIN plot I'm considering.  This allows me (as GM) to shift the opening games to what the players bring in and develop.  My first story for the first several games is usually simple and open to change.  Once you've got a direction from the players THEY get hooked and then you can add in your plot points following...  Think:  fun, exciting,  but flexible.<br/>\n<br/>\n 15. #15.  NPCs and boring scenes aren't the story...  One thing I've seen happen alot is the focus on NPCs... many GMs want to guide the story or release the exposition of the story so controlled that they unintentionally allow the NPCs to be the focus of the story up front.  If an NPC isn't interacting with a PLAYER CHARACTER, their story should be a sentence or two - if it gets described at all.  NPC vs. NPC combats are notorious for this... there's no reason to play through these die rolls...  Same said for the resolution of many combats that PCs have.  If you're at the OBVIOUS END of a combat situation... its best to wrap it up with a cool dramatic description.  I usually allow the players (assuming they're in "control" of the situation)  describe this wrap scene.   I would note that "cut-away" scenes are a different story... segway...<br/>\n<br/>\n         1. Cut-Aways:  I like using these for dramatic fun to help adjust the pace of the main action, by showing something happening elsewhere.  This isn't the best for beginning sessions and often confuses players that haven't experienced them before.  I generally try to stick to them lasting less than 3-5 minutes at most.  The cut-aways showing Darth Vader's scenes in Star Wars is a classic example.  It excites the story and moves along the dramatic tension but doesn't reveal too much to the players. <br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n  16. Game Table set up....  its VERY important to consider the location, set-up and out-of-game situations that you can prior to the session.  Like it or not the game environment - from seating arrangements to making sure we have sodas and such is very important to a good session and especially that 1st impression of game number one!  I always remind players to be considerate, bring snacks to share, help organize (by not leaving your crap in the way of others),  etc...  The experience of actual gaming can change the perception of the game itself ...  why have that be a possible negative aspect when you can plan for it to be positive  (which usually means that no one pays attention to it...  kinda like the best CGI, if you don't "notice" it... if it fits in seamlessly with the game - its great)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_146056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146056/#Comment_146056" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T16:33:35+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  4:33PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2008 4:39PM by kevperrine.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            17. Player Involvement...  One thing I do to ensure that the players are invested in the game/campaign is to know who I'm gaming with...  I can't game with people that I'm not willing to become friends with (and visca versa).  With this, I need the group to come to the game EAGER to play.  This helps to not plan the campaign in a vacuum.  I always look for player interest first, that's what excites me for GMing.  So I'll usually post my ideas for a campaign to the group and get feedback far prior to the first session.  If anyone's lackluster about the game, I don't want to play that campaign...  Its key to remember that its not the GMs job to entertain the players, the players all need to come and aid in entertaining each other (including the GM).  The GMs job is to help facilitate and direct that experience, not create it.  If the players aren't interested or invested from day one, you're fighting an uphill battle.<br/>\n<br/>\n  18. Assign roles... one thing that can help focus a game (especially in the beginning) is to ask players to help with tasks such as game table/area set up or rules aid (looking up rules).  If you ask players to take one of these "jobs" it can help them have a focus.  The beginning sessions of a campaign are harder (for players) to focus because they don't usually know "who" their character is yet... they have a background and an idea of a personality but its hard to figure out "how" to act/react and role-play in the beginning.  An easy task can help the player focus and aids the game (and GM) to boot.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_146057">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine" title="kevperrine"><img alt="kevperrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/kevperrine">kevperrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/146057/#Comment_146057" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-26T16:38:01+00:00" title="May 26, 2008  4:38PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 26, 2008 4:40PM by kevperrine.">edited May 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            19. Roll some freakin DICE!!  Nothing can be said that helps get the players focused more than rolling dice (or otherwise using the rules) and jumping into them being able to USE their statistics.  I often find that its best to open with an action scene (as noted above)  for TWO reasons.  As noted above its a great way to start dramatically but even MORE specifically jumping into an action sequence with RULES allow the players the comfort of some \\\\\\\\\\\\\\"hard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" facts.  They know what their stats are.  They can read the rules and figure out (factually) what their abilities are.  This is comparatively more comfortable to many players than the uncertainty of trying to figure out how to role-play their characters personality.  Jumping into action with rules allows the players to focus on the facts while slowly feeling their way into their character\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s role.  \\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" is a big fun part of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Role-playing Game\\\\\\\\\\\\\\".<br/>\n<br/>\n 20. Stereotypes!!  I always always open any new PC or NPC with an over hyped stereotype of what I want the other players to think about said PC/NPC.  If I want a character to be a pompous jerk, I overplay that stereotype in the first time I role-play them.  In my estimation this sets the tone for that character ... it makes strong 1st impression of that character that will FOREVER carry through to any future interaction with that character.  So no matter how I role-play or what the goals of that character are in the future they will always be seen as angled toward that initial first impression  (ie.  the pompous jerk, will be remembered as that even if/when he\\\\\\'s trying to be humble or thankful).  This helps overcome one of the challenges with RPGs - the huge amount of non-verbal personality interactions that you just can\\\\\\'t get the best of sitting at a game table...  That said, the same stereotypes CAN be overcome later with continued interaction with that character.  This is true to reality.  Think about how your 1st impression of people strongly taint your opinion of them, then later after getting to know them that impression CAN sometimes change.  Not always, but sometimes...<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nwhew... that was fun...<br/>\nI hope that helps.<br/>\nI hope that\\\\\\'s what you were looking for.<br/>\nIt was fun to do while lounging on a Memorial Day.<br/>\n<br/>\nQuestions?  Thoughts?  Feedack??<br/>\n<br/>\nthanks, good luck and good gaming!<br/>\n-kev-                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
