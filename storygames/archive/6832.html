Let's share some ideas and talk about how they interact with the rules of the game to (hopefully) produce fun.<br/><br/>Here's one to start out with:<br/><br/><b>The Leaf Temple of Shadows</b><br/>The party has a mission at the mountain monastery/temple of an obscure snake cult. As they enter the great hall, they realize the cultists have released thousands of poisonous serpents throughout the temple. The raised areas of the room are safe: the large table in the center, a scattering of somewhat rickety chairs, possibly chandeliers, raised balconies, and other furniture. Several cultists enter the room from side halls as their quarry tries to escape by running across the great dining table.<br/><br/>The opposition should have a mix of acrobatic melee fighters who can leap around the room and ranged attacks to harry the PC's progress. The floor area poses a dangerous poison attack hazard. Stunts include moving the room about rapidly by swinging on chandeliers or running across chair backs, using area attack to temporarily clear areas of the floor, or knocking an opponent into the snakes.<br/><br/>The idea behind the encounter is to create a sort of sandbox environment then give the party a reason to fight in it. There should be multiple possible paths around the room, each with its own risks and advantages. Acrobatics and athletics rule this environment. For a neat twist, come up with an environment where arcana, dungeoneering, or maybe even history is the skill to have.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152118">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152118/#Comment_152118" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T14:04:09+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  2:04PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, <a href="http://www.story-games.com/codex/index.php?title=Cool_Stuff_for_Fights" rel="nofollow">did you see this?</a><br/><br/>I like your snake room.

OK, this thread feeds right into that.<br/><br/>To clarify my thread a bit, what I'm really interested in is how the various elements of the encounter (monster, hazards, puzzles, skill challenges) mesh to make something new and interesting. A lot of the stuff in the codex has that, too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152130">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152130/#Comment_152130" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T16:34:56+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  4:34PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2008 4:35PM by J_Walton.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After they defeat the room full of snakes, they come upon a GIANT SNAKE DEMON which is only vulnerable in its head, the rest of its body is scaly and impenetrable.  Represent the snake on the board as a ribbon attached to a miniature of the snakes's head, maybe molded out of clay or something.  The snake's head is shifty in that kobold sense, but maybe more so.  It can shift two spaces at any point in the round and can break those up, shifting one space twice if it wants.  Also, it has a wicked Reflex save, so it's hard to shoot it without some area effect power.<br/><br/>So clearly, the best way to fight it is to... climb up the body and stab it in the head.  Players standing on the ribbon can use their "shift" move to advance one space at a time up the snake's body, but they better watch out for that head, which will try to shift around and bite them if they get too close.  Hopefully your allies can distract the head while you climb up.  Once you're on the head (probably making some climbing saves along the way), the snake can't bite you, but it can try to shake you off (doing damage if you fall) or maybe even slam you into the ceiling (requiring a Reflex save to avoid damage).<br/><br/>Note: the GM should not move the snake's body, only the snake's head, the body simply trails behind it.  Characters with minis on the body of the snake when it moves more than one space should make a Reflex save or a Climbing check to hold on, probably.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152133">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152133/#Comment_152133" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T17:00:35+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  5:00PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A fast underground river that intersects a wide tunnel is the ambush point for a tribe of subterranean humanoids.  There are a few boulders in the river, but for the most part, wading is inevitable.  The rushing water will slide medium creatures three squares downriver, and small creatures four squares, on its initiative count, which it rolls at the start of the fight.  The river runs to a waterfall, which is bad news.  The thigh-deep water is difficult terrain, but a character can treat it as normal terrain with a DC 15 Strength check for each square moved.  <br/><br/>A fast aquatic predator in the mix could make the fight even more dangerous.<br/><br/>The fight will obviously focus a lot more on immobilizing and knock-down attacks, which can potentially take a combatant out of the fight.  An interesting thing happens when there's melee in the water: Difficult terrain stops shifting, so if you want to wade upstream to avoid being swept over the waterfall, you'll provoke opportunity attacks.  That means there'll be a game of chicken in melee - who's going to break off first? Or will you both be swept over the edge?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152140">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152140/#Comment_152140" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-21T17:41:46+00:00" title="June 21, 2008  5:41PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2008 5:42PM by johnzo.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You could put some Beast Hunters in your 4E and layer some extra priorities into the fight.<br/><br/>To steal from Hard Boiled: say the room that is full of snakes and snarling cultists is also a nursery.

There were dune type sandworms (alot smaller though) and some nearby rifts. The worms couldn't be shot but they could be jumped onto and sort of guided/ridden.<br/><br/>Eventually the player got it, rode one into a rift (jumping off at the last second) to get rid of it, and...wasn't very impressed. After having asked for cool scenes (perhaps it isn't a cool scene to ride a giant worm into a magical portal, I dunno). I think it was the fact that I layed it out as a puzzle where I just GM fiated away the ability to shoot it to bits. I think he liked to think of himself as a puzzle solver, but really he'd only treat a puzzle as a puzzle when he wanted to - otherwise he'd just shoot his way through stuff, and I denied that. Just a note on how a one solution scene can get awkward.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152323">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152323/#Comment_152323" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-22T22:01:14+00:00" title="June 22, 2008 10:01PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mind Flayers surfing through dungeon tunnels on the backs of Aboleths!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152338">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152338/#Comment_152338" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T00:52:06+00:00" title="June 23, 2008 12:52AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: John Harper</cite><br/>If you also tie (some, not all) skill challenge rolls to areas of the battlefield (you can roll History when you're over here by the big tapestry that shows the story of the kingdom as a visual puzzle) then you can combine tactical battlemat movement with creative problem solving.</blockquote>\nTho, now that I think about it, skill challenges that happen when there are minis on the table will be kinda constrained.

The PCs need to gather everything they need for the gate-closing ritual before the fight brings the guild down or the hellhounds defeat them. The encouner combines a skill challenge with the hellhound combat. Consequences are the PCs can attempt to close the gate on their next encounter if they win.<br/><br/>Skill challenge actions include dechipering (or stealing) the encoded tapestry, finding the right book on a shelf, getting reagents out of the reagent cupboard, and so on. The hellhound breath weapons of course set anything they touch on fire. There are also lots of bookshelves and ladders for stunting. The skill challenge actions are all non-combat, but if the PCs can come up with a good stunt, they can combine their skill challenge roll with a combat action (like cutting the tapestry down on top of a foe, or skewering the book you need off the shelf while you're fencing with a cultist).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152494">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152494/#Comment_152494" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T15:21:10+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  3:21PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 23, 2008 7:06PM by johnzo.">edited June 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How do you construct a hybrid skill / combat encounter so that fulfilling one aspect of the encounter doesn't nullify the second?<br/><br/>Like, in the hellhound example, if the party are really expedient about killing the hellhounds, they can move on the skill challenge at their leisure, because there doesn't appear to be anything else actively opposing the party in that example.<br/><br/>A time limit on completing the skill challenge is an obvious solution.

It's got some good stuff to it, but it's not quite a showcase of 4E's niftiness)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_152500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152500/#Comment_152500" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T15:32:38+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  3:32PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony may also be thinking of my <a href="http://mightyatom.blogspot.com/2008/06/d-4e-how-im-doing-skill-challenges.html" rel="nofollow">alternate skill challenge system</a> which puts a kind of timer on things (the challenge makes attacks on the PCs every round).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_152593">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/philaros" title="philaros"><img alt="philaros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/320/nZLZ1C0PEQG5H.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/philaros">philaros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/152593/#Comment_152593" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-23T21:48:59+00:00" title="June 23, 2008  9:48PM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Andy</cite>Mind Flayers surfing through dungeon tunnels on the backs of Aboleths!</blockquote>\nKid, I like how you think!

(Note this cancels out if both parties are submerged to the same degree, for simplicity's and sanity's sake, so what really matters is when you're barely treading water while trying to fight someone in the shallows or on an overhang).
