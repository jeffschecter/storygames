The rules are coming along nicely, but I want to know:<br/>What kind of stories do you want to tell about Hollywood?<br/><br/>Right now, the levels of notoriety are "Starting out/a little bit of fame/precarious big time/dramatic comeback" and the classes are divided by what they do instead of job. (There are department managers/crew heads, managers, actors, up-their-own-ass artistes, gossip mongers, studio functionaries, in-the-mix producers and duplicitious self-servers.)<br/><br/>The reason I ask is because so little of the source material is ensemble. Most movies about the biz either:<br/>-Focus on one or two people<br/>and/or<br/>-Have a murder mystery<br/><br/>neither of which work great for campaign play. <br/><br/>So what stories do you want to tell about life in the entertainment business?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452002/#Comment_452002" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-30T05:39:42+00:00" title="March 30, 2016  5:39AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 30, 2016 5:46AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Hubristic tragedies</b> where charismatic but morally bankrupt stars get what's coming to them.  (Justice and schadenfreude.)<br/><br/><b>Struggles for identity</b>, as young stars lose their sense of self and connection while immersing in roles, networking, socializing with other hollywood types, dating and marrying and divorcing other hollywood types, and otherwise gradually forgetting how to be normal human beings.  (Mature character study.)<br/><br/>Struggles to make <b>great art</b>.  Who has vision, and something meaningful to say, and what obstacles will they encounter to realizing their cinematic masterpiece, and can they overcome those?  As a subset of this: with many worthy visions in play, can they cohere into a meaningful whole?  Or, a slightly different subset: can everyone else contribute to the auteur's vision without clashing or becoming passive?  (Story and project.)<br/><br/>Struggles to make <b>great art-generating machines</b>.  Connecting the dots from money to vision to talent to get a studio up and making good movie after good movie without anyone getting screwed over.  Forming relationships, optimizing processes, impressing investors, finding synergies.  Maybe assembling something like a Scorcese-Schrader-De Niro unit too.  Learning to work together in a way that produces great films.  (Story and project.)<br/><br/>Reinforcing or resisting <b>government action or cultural trends</b>.  Promoting or vilifying war, lionizing or casting suspicion on the feds, etc.  The pressures involved -- the rewards of cooperation, and the risks of resistance.  The splitting and in-fighting, loyalty and betrayal.  <i>Trumbo</i> and <i>Good Night and Good Luck</i> and <i>The Insider</i>, but about movies.  (Thematic premise-addressing.)<br/><br/><b>Corruption</b>, and some sort of fight against it.  The dark underbelly of drugs, booze, sex for promise of favors, callous narcissism and opportunism, back-stabbing, nepotism, shallowness, appearance-obsession, bribery, exploitative pornography, blackballing, grudges, politics, and general bad behavior.  It'd be nice to see that crap under siege, either by virtue or just a different sort of vice.  A few friends with principles, a new guild or union, the cops, the feds, the mafia, etc.  (Thematic premise-addressing.)<br/><br/>I could also see some black comedy, satirical, Cards Against Humanity / <i>Very Bad Things</i> type thing where <b>everyone is just awful</b>, and they all prosper by it, and we play to see who prospers the most and whose awfulness makes us gasp or giggle the most.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ultraberg" title="Ultraberg"><img alt="Ultraberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ultraberg">Ultraberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452003/#Comment_452003" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-30T05:50:01+00:00" title="March 30, 2016  5:50AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is the best answer I could've ever expected.

Hollywood works for once just as it is supposed to, all the quirky institutions showing their good sides as the historical reasons for their existence all make an appearance, justifying the wisdom of it all.<br/><br/>I wouldn't particularly look for both of those at once, obviously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452200">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452200/#Comment_452200" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-14T18:26:20+00:00" title="April 14, 2016  6:26PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>all the quirky institutions showing their good sides as the historical reasons for their existence all make an appearance</blockquote>I would play that.  Partly as an educational exercise, so it'd be nice if you had all your facts right, but a simple discovery exercise of the GM's made-up stuff would also suffice.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_452215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452215/#Comment_452215" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-15T17:11:51+00:00" title="April 15, 2016  5:11PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That makes me imagine a game where you play the One Good Production, or the One Good Film Studio (or some other such) in Hollywood. Every character is a beautiful artist who has some incredible bad blood with another studio/company/director - they were taken advantage of, sold out, blackmailed, ripped off, or some other such thing.<br/><br/>You play trying to make your artistic dream work, with a team of great people, while the other productions/studios try to keep you down, using every underhanded means at their disposal. Sometimes this means burying you in bad publicity; sometimes it means hiring a bunch of arsonists to set fire to your studio set in the middle of the night. Will you stick to your morals and keep your work clean, or will you stoop to the same kind of illegal behaviour your competitors are engaging in?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_452277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ultraberg" title="Ultraberg"><img alt="Ultraberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ultraberg">Ultraberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/452277/#Comment_452277" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-04-18T23:56:29+00:00" title="April 18, 2016 11:56PM">April 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that struggle, Paul_T, is at the heart of Hollyworld, and I even built a class around it!
