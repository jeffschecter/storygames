Goswick<br/><br/> <br/><br/><i>Anything too stupid to be said is sung.<br/>- Voltaire</i>\n<blockquote>What happens if you combine \u201cFame\u201d with \u201cHarry Potter\u201d and \u201cd20\u201d?  Why nothing more than a great TV show about a school for bards!  Enjoy!</blockquote>\n\tWord came silently as you slept, on the cusp of your 11th year.  An imp bearing a singing telegram crept through the streets of your small village, or great city, and delivered without fail the message that you had been selected by the Horncrest School of the Bardic Arts.  Perhaps your parents, also Bards, rejoiced.  Perhaps they were barbarians or straight fighters or wizards instead and they tried to hide their tears from you.  Whatever the case, the next day you were prepped and sent to the City of the King to enter the portal that lead to the school.  You no doubt also stopped off to shop for supplies on the way at Abbey Road, the premier shopping arcade for Bards and their ilk.<br/><br/>\tNow you stand before the Portal leading to the school.  You will soon be sorted and begin your studies.  Friendships will be made, House-bonds formed, and many subjects crammed into your young minds.  It is as it always has been at the school, save for a rumor.  Some say that \u201che\u201d is here, none other than The Bard Who Lived.  The one Bard who met a challenge rating 7 creature and lived \u2013 somehow.  You look for the tell-tale treble clef on the head of the students you stand with.  Where is this Harry Connick?<br/><br/><b>How to run this:</b><br/><br/>For fun, first off.  While the stories are fun-filled, there is no reason they can't be challenging as well and have a substantive story, even given the tongue-in-cheek nature of the setting.<br/><br/>In d20, I would suggest 2nd level characters.  Their first level is in any class they could normally take. Ans the second level has to be bard.  If the character doesn't take Bard as a level every other level at least, they fail out of the school.  Bard levels mark how well the students are learning and measure the esteem the character is held at in the school.<br/><br/>The instructors should be no more than 5th level bards and no more than 3 levels in anything else and no more than 10 levels total (and then, only the kindly headmaster).<br/><br/>In any other game, this just falls away, but insure that the Bard aspect of all characters is pronounced and punish those who fall behind in their studies.<br/><br/>There are some obvious comedy tropes and takes on the shows you can use.  Most of them come from the Potter level of this mish-mash, because it is most genre relevant, but terminology taken from d20 is vital to any game not run with d20.  If run with d20, make sure to allow players to talk mechanics in character.  Of course they know what a level is, and what estimated Hit Points are \u2013 they study adventuring after all!<br/> <br/>Be careful to keep contact with the non-Bardic community to a minimum until the players have leveled up to be able to function well against them.  Most encounters with the outside world should serve to drive home the uselessness of Bards or their rejected status in society.  Keep in mind that while their fellow dungeoneers think they are chumps, normal people love Bards because they are entertaining.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_197700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/197700/#Comment_197700" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-18T19:18:51+00:00" title="March 18, 2009  7:18PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How about something where you compete for reputation with other bards.

Culture osmosis and assimilation as the social issues of the time, and our players as the authorities others look towards for answers and help.<br/><br/>I never got the group together for it, and really I have to wonder how well the mechanics of it would have worked out in 3.5D&amp;D.  Since then I've given thought to simply overlaying the "Bard" idiom on top of another "class" (in games like D&amp;D4) that I know to be mechanically functional and sound.  It loses the flavor of a systematic "support" unit, but it might work as long as the mechanics of the base class don't interfere with the idiom (and in D&amp;D4 most class mechanics can very easily work as an engine for any social idiom, given some flavor tweaking).<br/><br/>Such solutions really don't have the game <i>about</i> being a Bard, though; they just have the idea of a Bard as a backdrop to whatever the game is really about (in D&amp;D4's case, smashing people in the face with +3 shocking lyres).

They could demand the hospitality of any noble house they passed on their travels, and in the hamlets and villages, folks would gather round to buy them drinks just so they could hear news of the outside world.
