The reason for this is fairly straightforward: while not everyone agrees with this assessment, it is my belief that most RPG rulebooks are essentially teaching texts and/or workbooks* or unconsciously modeled after them. In short, an RPG rulebook's essential task is to teach the game to the person reading it.<br/><br/>As such, being aware of some of the rules of instruction and learning can help you deliver your game into the minds of the players as clearly and painlessly as possible.<br/><br/>What follows is a formula for determining the relative 'readability' of your game text.  <br/><br/>This does NOT address poor use of language, tpyos, or the text's organization (not to be confused with "layout", which is a prettier thing).\n<blockquote><br/>Calculate the basic readability of a text using this formula.<br/><br/>1. Jot down the number of words in successive sentences. If the piece is long, you may wish to take several samples of 100 words, spaced evenly through it. If you do, stop the sentence count with the sentence which ends nearest the 100 word total.<br/><br/>2. Divide the total number of words in the passage by the number of sentences. This gives the average sentence length of the passage.<br/><br/>3. Count the number of words with three syllables or more per 100 words. Don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t count the words:<br/>* That are capitalized (unless they start a sentence).<br/>* That are combinations of short, easy words, like \xe2\u20ac\u0153bookkeeper.\xe2\u20ac\x9d<br/>* That are verb forms made into three syllables by adding \xe2\u20ac\u201ced or \xe2\u20ac\u201ces (like \xe2\u20ac\u0153created\xe2\u20ac\x9d or \xe2\u20ac\u0153trespasses\xe2\u20ac\x9d).<br/>* That your target audience reads every day.  (\xe2\u20ac\u0153Industry\xe2\u20ac\x9d texts can be more complicated than non-industry texts.)<br/><br/>This gives you the percentage of hard words in the passage.<br/><br/>4. To get the Fog index, total the two factors just counted (items 2 and 3 above) and multiply by 0.4.  <br/><br/>This will give you a total that equates the reading material to how many years of schooling would be required to understand it.</blockquote>\nSo if your text gets a score of 17.2, or \xe2\u20ac\u0153equal to 17 years of school\xe2\u20ac\x9d \xe2\u20ac\u201c it is therefore written for people at about the (U.S.) Masters Degree level of schooling.<br/><br/>Most public newpapers and magazines aim for a reading level equal to 3 years of schooling. USA Today is higher, defaulting to 4 years of schooling.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65101/#Comment_65101" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T15:25:57+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  3:25PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Couple short notes:<br/><br/>a) Microsoft Word has a "Readability" metric that you can enable through Grammar Check.  It is, however, designed by Microsoft, which means it's about as reliable as you'd expect, and uses its own rules that it will not share with you.  It <em>says</em> that it is a Fleish-Kincaid Readability Index (which is similar to this Fog Index), but it's not, since Word can't actually count syllables, only letters and groups of letters.<br/><br/>b) Readability is a good <em>guideline</em> but is a crap-ass <em>dictate</em>.  Do not get hung up on readability, because it's seldom worth it.  If you can fix readability easily, do so.  If you can't fix it easily, consider if the passage is actually and fundamentally complicated and cannot be expressed in simple terms.  That may mean that you leave it as-is or you turn the paragraph into a page or two taking it apart piece by piece.  The error is when you take apart <em>everything</em> piece by piece in pursuit of some arbitrary readability goal.<br/><br/>c) Some things <em>should</em> be hard to read.  This is less frequently applicable in technical writing (ie game rules), but if you want your reader to slow down and pay attention, ramping up the readability suddenly will get you that effect.  A reader is more likely to stop and reread this section or take a slight breather and let the concepts set in his mind before continuing.<br/><br/>d) Lots of these readability indexes have no love for the semicolon and colon.  <em>Assuming you are using them correctly</em>, you should count most semicolons and all colons as periods and the clauses that they delimit as "sentences."  (The response to this point is that most readers don't know how to <em>read</em> semicolons and colons correctly, to which I say fuck 'em.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65146">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Doyce" title="Doyce"><img alt="Doyce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.average-bear.com/img/dice-c.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Doyce">Doyce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65146/#Comment_65146" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T16:04:43+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  4:04PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 24, 2007 4:05PM by Doyce.">edited April 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I entirely agree with JBR's points above.

Try to do both whenever possible, but cling to 'clearly' at the very least.  <br/><br/>If you find yourself unable to write either simply or clearly about a given topic, step back and ask yourself why.

Just because the <i>transmission</i> is clear, doesn't mean the <i>reception</i> is clear, and to the extent you can anticipate this it's usually a good idea to correct it.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo my mind, <i>Sorcerer</i> is a game which is written (for the most part) simply, and always very clearly, and yet still manages to confuse tons of people in spite of its simplicity and clarity.  <i>Once you understand it already</i> it reads like a dream because it's so lucid, but by then you're not likely to be consulting the text.  Meanwhile, readers who don't understand anything think they understand it all because it's so simple, and this false confidence gets them into trouble.  Sometimes it's good to work at something: it means you've internalized it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_65180">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65180/#Comment_65180" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T21:42:30+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  9:42PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A quick Google search turned up a Fog calculator here:<br><br><a href="http://simbon.madpage.com/Fog/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://simbon.madpage.com/Fog/</a><br/><br/>Passages from <i>My Life with Master</i> score between 12.89 and 13.86.<br/><br/>Paul                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_65181">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/65181/#Comment_65181" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-04-24T21:51:58+00:00" title="April 24, 2007  9:51PM">April 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm...I guess the calculator doesn't correspond directly to the algorithm comprised by steps 1 to 4 in your first post.

Some games get me EXCITED to play them, partly because the text is clearly written by someone who's into what they're doing, and loves it.<br/><br/>The same is true of teachers.  Think of the teacher that most made you WANT to study their material -- I'm going to bet they used clear, simple (as much as possible), direct communication, and <b>had an evident enjoyment of the subject</b>.  Some books work better in an impersonal narrator voice; that's fine, but while it's a bit of the default in academic teaching, it's maybe not the best model for game rules.  They're <i>games</i> after all.<br/><br/>Grab the rules for Jungle Speed, for an example.  Decry the game if you like, but the guys that wrote those rules conveyed the kind of game they wanted people to play -- wacky, crazy, non-serious fun.

A bit higher than I expected.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Think of the teacher that most made you WANT to study their material -- I'm going to bet they used clear, simple (as much as possible), direct communication, and had an evident enjoyment of the subject."<br/>\n<br/>\nActually my favorite teacher was my high school English teacher. She was like the cliche of an eccentric professor and used words like "facetious" in normal conversation. She was cool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wonder if that's part of the reason why my "plain spoken" manuscript comes in at a 13.56? :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
