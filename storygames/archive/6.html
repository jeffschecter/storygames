                            Dude, the most I make of it is this: <br/>
<br/>
Pushing is going out and being active with your stuff. "I have this cool spiritual attribute which I will now use."<br/>
<br/>
Pulling is throwing your stuff out there and demanding that someone use it. "I bet someone could bring my spiritual attributes into this scene in a cool way."<br/>
<br/>
Then again, maybe I'm TEH WRONG!                        </div>

<p>Yeah, that seems about right. But I've been seeing two distinctions:</p>
<p><strong>In most cases</strong><br/>
Pushing means a mechanic or convention where you change the characters around you or use their stuff in play.</p>
<p>Pulling means a mechanic or convention where you open up areas (or have set open areas) on your character for people to use or change.</p>
<p><strong>In terms of aggressive and cooperative</strong></p>
<p>Pushing has an aggressive feel: You look at your neighbor's character sheet, and say "Oh, BTW, (erase erase, pencil pencil) you now have the SA of 'I will become Thulsa Doom' !".</p>
<p>Pulling is a more cooperative feel: You look at your neighbor's character sheet which has "I am destined to become Thulsa doom" on it, and you use that when your player interacts with him, bringing out those elements in play. Like, in PTA, you could set a scene where your character is talking to the Young Thulsa Doom character, and set up the conflict foreshadowing their development into Thulsa Doom.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> : I might be ass-wrong.</p>
<p>Also, it's in interesting idea.  I don't know if it warrants ALL that discussion, because I think the next logical step is to make a game that uses it or "lets try this in a game we already have. Drift, yeah, but whattevah."</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: I indeed was ass-wrong. See points below.</strong> (^.^)</p>

                            I am very confused by these discussions, and talking about it with Emily in person, we reached the conclusion that we're talking about four or five different things, all of which overlap slightly.

                            At the moment, I get it when I read it in someone's blog, and then I get something entirely different when I read a forum post or what have you :)<br/>
<br/>
It looks like these two concepts are really two groups of closely related variant concepts, and hopefully they'll all have names soon! <br/>
<br/>
What I wouldn't mind seeing are designs that more-or-less bribe people to accept pushes and pulls, creating incentive for this sort of interaction but not mandating it.                        </div>

                            I get the concept, I just don't think it actually has much to do with game mechanics or design as much as it has to do with how a particular play group interacts at the social level.<br/>
<br/>
In other words Push vs. Pull manifests (in order from most significant to least) in.<br/>
<br/>
1) how the players at the table interact with each other in real life<br/>
2) how the players at the table interact with each other while gaming<br/>
3) how the presentation of the game rules suggest players should interact with each other.<br/>
4) actual specific rules.<br/>
<br/>
#1 I think is by far the most influential.  How does any given group of friends reach a consensus on what movie to go see, or whether to order chinese or pizza, or whether to play PTA or go bowling?  If they tend to interact with each other in a very male / yang / push fashion solically, then they'll tend to engage creatively in a very male / yang / push fashion when gaming.  If they tend to interact with each other in a very female / yin / pull fashion socially, then they'll tend to interact with each other that way when gaming...pretty much without regard for how the game is written and often drifting mechanics (even subconsiously) to get it to work that way.<br/>
<br/>
Universalis has been used as an example of a Yang game design.  Certainly it was written by a couple of guys who are pretty Yang socially and the text I wrote carries a high degree of Yanginess...and most definitely when I play it I'm a Push Push Pusher...<br/>
<br/>
But Chris Bradley doesn't play it that way.  His group uses the Negotiation piece of the Challenge mechanics pretty much as written as do I.  But whereas I use Negotiation to sabre-rattle and push for what I want, his group uses it in a very Yin consensus building fashion.  Same rule, same rule text, different personalities around the table.<br/>
<br/>
So I think the concept is a valid one, I'm not sure you can really design a game that is one or the other.  You can design rules that can be used to Push, you can present the rules in the game text with examples that are chock full of Push...but none of that is going to get Yinny players to Push (or vice versa).<br/>
<br/>
I think the best use for the concept from a game design standpoint is just to be aware where your own predilictions lie and make sure that any Push vs. Pull elements in the rules / game text are there because you conciously want them to be not because they just arose by default. <br/>
<br/>
In Uni (while we didn't have the language of Push / Pull, Yin / Yang at the time) we very conciously modeled the game on capitalist economic concepts...which are very much Push oriented.  Tony LB even more so with Capes.                        </div>

                            John Harper nailed it.  Pull creates a space for something to happen.  Push is just making something happen.<br/><br/>Don't get confused by Vincent.  He's taking the basic idea and running somewhere else with it.<br/><br/>If you want an example of Pull in design, check out my short game for Shreyas' recent Game Chef thing, <a href="http://thou-and-one.blogspot.com/2006/01/kazekami-kyoko-kills-kublai-khan.html" rel="nofollow">Kazekami Kyoko Kills Kublai Khan</a>.  All the questions are Pull (though the rhetorical ones less so), while the declarations could be Push or Pull, depending whether you're adding a new component (character, situation, etc.) into play or setting up something for another player to handle.  <br/><br/>Check out Kublai's alternative contribution form too.  It's an objection to the other player's contribution, ala <i>Polaris</i>, but it comes in the form of asking for clarification, so it's a very Pull-y mechanic where a very Push-y one is normally used.  It's not, "No, you can't do that!" but "Tell me how you're doing that, again?"                        </div>

<b>Re Yin/Yang</b><br/><br/>I'm wondering if there's a way to "aggressively pull"? Like to introduce elements of the game (whether it's "throwing dice" or just explanative text) that almost forces people to pull from each other?  The easiest I can think of is "Make pulling other elements get you "More Dice", and beef up the difficulties to be really hard to overcome".<br/><br/>Reason I say is because we were demoing The Face Of Angels yesterday at a general open gaming event: There was one guy in the group who honestly dug the feel of Indie games (he had played three that day), but honestly wasn't really "on the ball" as much as the other heavyweights in the game.  TFoA involves a bit of pull (pulling elements from other characters' backgrounds, etc), and there's just some people (well, honestly it's mostly going to happen in demos and the like) who just aren't familiar with pulling. <br/><br/>In other words, is there ways to enable pulling and do it in a way so that it "Highly Encourages" (ie almost forces) people to pull in elements?<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

<br/>
I'm not sure exactly what you mean by aggressively pulling. Are you just talking about mechanics that tie reward cycles into pulling in general, or just pulling a few specific elements that are most likely to draw attention from the other players?                        </div>

                            Here's what I meant by "agressively pulling":<br/>
<br/>
In that aforementioned The Face of Angels game, which involves (that is, "Is written to involve" and "should involve") a LOT of pulling of other folks' elements on their "sheet" into your scenes.  However, we got about 2/3 through the game when we suddenly realized that none of us had pulled ANYONE's elements into their own scenes, and most of the time they didn't even use their own elements in their scenes (yet we did use many of the GM's elements, where the GM is just another type of character, in our scenes, so there was pulling there).  It was like suddenly realizing through the first game of D&amp;D "Oh, shit guys, it looks like we were supposed to be rolling dice of some kind all this time".<br/>
<br/>
So, to me, I love the idea of this pulling stuff, and think it's important to get a lot of involvement if you're in one of those "players create the universe kinds of games", but if pulling can by simply ignored entirely, there's not a lot of point.<br/>
<br/>
So I'm looking for ways that the Players simply Can Not Help but to be aware of pulling, and regularly be pulling in-game.  Pulling is one of those things that, without tuning or rules of some kind, could easily be ignored: I'd like to see situations where pulling cannot be ignored.<br/>

                            You'd've thought with one gigantic character sheet sitting in front of us we'd've hit that sooner, don'tcha think, Andy? Man, what a head slap that was.<br/>
<br/>
Still, aggressively pulling, hmm. Maybe in TFoA, you couldn't frame a scene without physically touching the sheet, pointing to something in the process? Or maybe by documenting every little thing you do somehow on the sheet to remind everyone there of your goals and resources?<br/>
<br/>
Or am I just focusing on fixing that one gameplay and not getting the discussion at all?                        </div>

                            Hmm. The force pulling is an interesting question.  Lately with Fate we've very strongly opened up how usable aspect are, so that virtually any aspect in a scene (including some that are not necessary on any character) is "in play" and can be used by anyone, as long as they can make sense of it.  It doesn't always work - players like to look at their own sheet first - but in situations where they have used the applicable material on thier own sheet, it is often easier to draw in another personor thing than to try to come up with a really roundabout exscuse for applying an inappropriate aspect.<br/>
<br/>
We're still seeing all of the impacts of this, but getting players to the point of feeling a need for something and forcing them to look around with clearer vision really seems like the sweet spot.<br/>
