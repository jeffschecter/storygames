That's cool, it just means we need to do a little more planning before hand and UNITE AS A COMMUNITY (but let's not get too huggy, alright, I don't like the look of some of you). I figure it'll be handy to have a thread where we can say "I'm interested in running a session of this 4 person game" and then others can chime in and join the crowd. <br/><br/>So what do you want to run but need help with? Let us know.<br/><br/>NOTE: I realize there's the ige wiki, but i think this kind of discussion would clog it up needlessly. Also this is a place more folks check regularly. If i'm wrong and the wiki is a better fit, say so and we can close/move this thread, no biggie.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_244333">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244333/#Comment_244333" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T06:37:35+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  6:37AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Like I said on the other thread, I'd happily do a game swap with someone on <i><a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a></i>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_244334">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr" title="Kevin Allen Jr"><img alt="Kevin Allen Jr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Kevin%20Allen%20Jr">Kevin Allen Jr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/244334/#Comment_244334" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-01T06:41:55+00:00" title="December  1, 2009  6:41AM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I'm going to run Empire of Dust. It's a great game that i don't get to play enough. It even runs really well with a big group, believe it or not. So if I can't find another GM who's interested in it I'll just throw down for a big group of like 7 players. <br/><br/>But i would rather split the party into two teams of 4 each. <br/><br/>See, i was thinking about it and this new event format enables some cool parallel storytelling techniques, like...<br/><br/>\u2022 having two or three groups meet up and then separate<br/>\u2022 Player swaps between groups<br/>\u2022 two groups knowing or unknowingly competing for the same goal<br/>\u2022 GM swapping<br/><br/>I want to try some of these tools out, anyone interested in joining me?<br/><br/>Things to know about Empire of Dust:<br/>\u2022 the game is super easy to both teach and learn<br/>\u2022 it's really fast paced action<br/>\u2022 players really respond to it<br/>\u2022 I will bring all the materials both groups need to play (I've got a double set of tiles and can run the rules pdf off my laptop while another group references the book)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246289">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zipht" title="zipht"><img alt="zipht" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/173668_1770784817_2474986_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zipht">zipht</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246289/#Comment_246289" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T20:48:07+00:00" title="December 11, 2009  8:48PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Like I said on the other thread, I'd happily do a game swap with someone on<i><a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a></i>.</blockquote>\nRob, has anyone taken you up on that ofter?<br/><br/>I debating if I want to run <a href="http://realms.co.uk/covenant/" rel="nofollow">Covenant</a> or  <a href="http://storiesyouplay.com/44/" rel="nofollow">44: A Game of Automatic Fear</a>.<br/><br/>Nick                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_246298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan" title="MPOSullivan"><img alt="MPOSullivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/581/nMZWSVRTOY7XL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MPOSullivan">MPOSullivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246298/#Comment_246298" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-11T22:51:47+00:00" title="December 11, 2009 10:51PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know that this thread is supposed to be about people asking for assistance, but I've got a bit of another idea.  Hope you guys don't mind a little bit of well-intentioned thread-jack.  <br/><br/>I've been considering what kinds of games I'd like to run this Dreamation, and I have a very deep interest in being "back up" for other GMs and running a second table of their games.  I've run my fair share of Spirit of the Century and the Mountain Witch, should anyone be thinking about running wither of those and may want a bit of back up.  I've also run some Sorcerer and Don't Rest Your Head as well, and can brush up on either to help run a game before the con starts.  <br/><br/>Feel free to whisper at me should you have any questions or maybe want me to carry our books and do your homework.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_246362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl" title="Robert_Bohl"><img alt="Robert_Bohl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i171.photobucket.com/albums/u298/robnjru/icon32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Robert_Bohl">Robert_Bohl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/246362/#Comment_246362" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-12T18:50:02+00:00" title="December 12, 2009  6:50PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: zipht</cite><cite>Posted By: Robert Bohl</cite>Like I said on the other thread, I'd happily do a game swap with someone on<i><a href="http://misspentyouthgame.com/" rel="nofollow">Misspent Youth</a></i>.</blockquote>\nRob, has anyone taken you up on that ofter?<br/><br/>I debating if I want to run<a href="http://realms.co.uk/covenant/" rel="nofollow">Covenant</a>or<a href="http://storiesyouplay.com/44/" rel="nofollow">44: A Game of Automatic Fear</a>.<br/><br/>Nick<br/>So far no one has.
