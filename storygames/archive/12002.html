During the game I got a rule wrong:<br/>\n<br/>\nWhen PCs acquired Danger, I kept a tally of the total D-points. Then I dished out Threats of various kinds (a reduced hit, escalations on two existing minor threats, a new threat with a countdown) across the entire scene. <br/>\nLater it was pointed out that I should have distributed D-points immediately back into the scenes, rather than storing them up in a pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe argument for the GM immediately burning Danger points is that he can't save up for giant Danger 5 Total Disasters. This action would cause the players to be very conservative with their Danger Dice, fearing the giant chaos they're building up to.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe argument for storing Danger points is it allows the GM to dole out different Danger level threats at his own pace, rather than as the instant karma pool demands. Otherwise the GM must nickel &amp; dime the players on escalations and reduced hits \u2013 which ironically could also cause the players to be conservative about Danger Dice. If a player adds a bunch of Danger Dice to a roll, she knows that the GM will spend all the Danger generated that round.<br/>\n<br/>\nI ended our scene with D-points still in my GM's pool, because I felt like the players had done a good job overcoming what I threw at them, and pacing demanded that the scene draw to a close -- no need to draw it out just because I still had unspent points. <br/>\n<br/>\nI could see a sadistic GM hoarding Danger for PC-crippling disasters, if the rules didn't say otherwise. But I also believe that RPGs like Danger Patrol can get by with fewer "safety restrictions," because the players and GM are mature enough to not be dicks.<br/>\n<br/>\nOpinions from Mr. Harper and the rest of the community?<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks,<br/>\ntravis                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268527/#Comment_268527" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T08:56:35+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  8:56AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 23, 2010 8:58AM by nemomeme.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your accidental method hadn't occurred to me.<br/><br/>I like having to spend my danger right away because I still have the dangers the players narrated in the forefront of my mind and it is that character's direct action that leads to the situation changing.  It reinforces the risk decisions that particular player made.  If they're not taken care of, escalated Threats can possibly lead to disasters if the PCs are conservative in their attacks.  The nickles add up to dimes and quarters if you've a reasonable number of Threats they have to tackle. "Threat dice remain on the card until the threat is defeated."<br/><br/>If the players are playing overly conservatively I'd first argue that they're not really playing in the spirit of the game.  I'd additionally recommend the liberal use of Countdown Threats and Staged Threats so they feel some pressure to roll lots of dice in spite of the risk of a danger 5 Threat move resulting.<br/><br/>The GM has considerable pacing control in their ability to decide on the fly how many successes it takes to eliminate Threats without the addition of a pool.  They should use it in the service of fun and good pacing.  A sadistic GM <i>could </i> pull all kinds of levers and hammer the PCs if they want to, yeah.  But they probably shouldn't (wouldn't?) be running Danger Patrol.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_268559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268559/#Comment_268559" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T10:19:54+00:00" title="April 23, 2010 10:19AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had been toying around with saving up Danger from the characters' rolls for use later in the scene, especially when a lot of Danger is rolled and yet it really wouldn't make sense in the Fiction to have a minor mook somehow cause a Total Disaster.<br/>I kind of like the idea of having a few more Danger Moves options, where some of them are held until slightly later, like reinforcements that show up a few turns later. Or, alternatively, Danger Moves that reinforce other threats, like something that makes a Countdown move faster, or adds to the menace of another threat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_268699">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/268699/#Comment_268699" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-23T14:22:26+00:00" title="April 23, 2010  2:22PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think spending the danger in the moment is the way to go. Saving it up isn't terrible, and it obviously worked for you, so I don't think you need to stop doing that or anything. But I recommend not saving it up.<br/><br/>Also -- this may not be in the rules, I forget -- you can spread the danger you get across several threat moves that you do right now. So if someone rolls 5 danger and it would be silly for a total disaster right then, just do a Threat 3 and Threat 2 move instead. (Or a 4 and 1. Or five 1s.).<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Michael">@Michael</a>: I've also been thinking about adding a few new threat moves.
