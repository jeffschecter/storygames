Seems I can't access any of them here in South America so I'm trying to make my own. I know I can't reinvent the wheel (though I'm hacking the Burning one a bit) and I'm still trying to come to terms to what I actually want. So far I've got this:<br/>\n<br/>\n-The setting is created at the beginning of the game a la Burning Wheel, then the PCs are created. Everything else is created as it shows up in the game, so the game needs no prep at all.<br/>\n-Each player get to play a character of his own, perhaps will have to play some NPCs. <br/>\n-Locations, items, monsters and NPCs are created by the players as they appear on the course of the game. Mostly by random tables grouped in a single device called "the hellraiser" placed on the center of the table within the reach of every player :P<br/>\n-Situations are proposed by the players trough the use of cards with narrative twists, a la Whimsy Cards. Either a situation is solved or changed by the cards after an amount of turns.<br/>\n-I like aspects from fudge and beliefs from the wheel, so PCs will start with that.<br/>\n-NPCs, locations, items, monsters, all will be created with just a description randomly forged with the hellraiser. Their details, abilities and other characteristics will be created by the players as they interact with them, by interpreting the result of the dice and rolling on the hellraiser or using the cards.<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example: Player A describes the creature, it looks like a dragon. Player B attacks the dragon. He wins, the dragon is slain, it either can be described as a feeble creature or another explanation can be rolled on the hellraiser (perhaps it was an illusion or perhaps it was already dead). Now, if player B would  had failed, he gets to add a trait to the dragon, as "though skin" or something rolled on the hellraiser. Like "teleporting". So yes, no creativity is wasted creating things that won't be used, and nobody knows what's going to happen next.<br/>\n<br/>\n-I'm not using skills or abilities, perhaps just one describing the class of the character. Yet PCs can level up. There's a single level stat. Lets say players start at level 1, the level of the next encounter is rolled by dice. If the level of the encounter is equal or just one level higer, the players have a chance. If it's greater, they have to run and find a way around. Or come back later with enough level. If the challenge is two levels lower than the players, they get to tell how they kick the crap out of their enemies.<br/>\n<br/>\nOk, any ideas, questions, references or critics are welcome.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_329861">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/thadrine" title="thadrine"><img alt="thadrine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/thadrine">thadrine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/329861/#Comment_329861" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-15T06:09:40+00:00" title="June 15, 2011  6:09AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can we see this "Hellraiser?"<br/><br/>And am I to understand that there no real task resolution mechanics, other than the random table.

The idea is that if any player has a question about the situation, the answer can be rolled on the hellraiser. However it will need to be made more specific. I talked about it yesterday with some friends, and it still needs a ton of work. So far player character creation looks good, and I'll need to create a new set of tables to generate locations, npcs, items and monsters in a single 3d6 roll. It's doable since all it's got to say is "looks like this" and either their capacities and/or intentions will be discovered (actually, created) by the players as the story goes on.<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, there is a task resolution mechanic present in the game. Players roll 2d6, one dice for positive outcome, one for negative outcome. The higher indicates how things are resolved. This mechanics works when the challenge level is either the same, one up or one level lower than PC's level. But your concern about the task resolution mechanic comes from the lack of crunch or for other reasons?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_330424">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330424/#Comment_330424" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-17T10:16:51+00:00" title="June 17, 2011 10:16AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ok, so far I've got<br/>-a random setting creator, perhaps still to complex, Ive got to make the tables shorter somehow.<br/><br/>-Objectives are defined easily: players make a list of three threats and three hopes. They can be either events, NPCS, items, locations, etc. They are listed in order from the lest to the most powerful, so the first objective they have is to find/reach/confront the number one of each list. This doesn't take away the suspense, it's like the heroes have some plan in mind or that they are going for the most obvious choices any adventure in the setting would take to solve the crisis at hand (whose apparent effects are defined on the setting generator)<br/><br/>-a random location generator with a 4d6 roll. Now players know where they are.<br/><br/>Now I'm working on a obstacle generator. This would include either monsters, npcs, obstacles in the terrain, traps, cursed locations... and I'm short one kind of obstacle in the list. Perhaps an argument between PCs? If I can't get a good idea for another obstacle, I'll have to repeat one of the previous ones in the list :P<br/><br/>As soon as these tables are done, I'll be able to built an actual Hellraiser &gt;:D                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
