So today we're asking your opinion on a few issues. Your responses will be taken into consideration as we move forward. Please note that we cannot afford the time or money to create too many extra categories. Also in your response, please note if you are a publisher, fan, if you've submitted to the ENnies/plan on doing so, etc.:<br/><br/>I. As the category structure is set out currently, anyone submitting product for the ENnies is relegated into two broad classifications - "Publisher" or "Fan".  A Publisher is someone who produces role playing games or related products for sale.  A Fan is someone who produces role playing games or related products for free.  These classifications have been made in order to recognize those people who produce product in their free time and who generally have fewer resources to devote to their product.  Also, since the Awards and many publishers started as fan web sites or productions, the ENnies wish to maintain their commitment to acknowledging the efforts of those in the trenches getting started.<br/><br/>We have two options to consider:<br/><br/>A. Keep 'em separated: Offer a Fan Product category (or more if quality and quantity of submissions so warrant).  Categories would most likely be Best Web Site, Best Serial (webzine, podcast, blog), Best Product.<br/><br/>B. Let 'em compete together: Eliminate the Fan categories altogether.  Many Fan productions believe they have sufficient quality to stand on their own feet without needing any special category to give them a leg up.<br/><br/>It has to be either/or so the rules can be applied to everybody.  It would not be acceptable to have only some Fan products "opt in".<br/><br/>II. The definition of the category allows for any submitted free product or webhancement from a publisher, whether it's a full product, quickstart rules, etc.  This category was created to replace the Best Web Site category, since for publishers, a web site is essentially a marketing and public relations tool, just like handing out free product.  It is a "thank you" and an acknowledgement of the investment required to create a product that is not in itself going to make money.<br/><br/>Last year there was some discussion as to what should be permitted as a free product in the Free Product/Webhancement category.  Should we change the definition of this category?  And if so, how?<br/><br/>III.

This has improved a lot, but given the amount of material they have to go through, the bias is still potentially there.  With the fans themselves, this is a huge problem.  Many people (possibly a majority) vote in categories where they don't know most of the products.  So the tendency is to vote for the company you heard of.  Given that the ENnies greatest source of publicity is ENWorld, you can figure out which products and companies the vast majority of voters will have an awareness of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274341">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274341/#Comment_274341" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T14:17:11+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  2:17PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Combine them, but have separate categories for free game or enhancement and free quickstart. This isn't due to any sort of anti-big-guy sentiment; I'm sure if Evil Hat decides to submit the DFRPG quickstart it'll do juuuust fine. It's because quickstarts are their own beast, inherently, and should be judged differently than free games/supplements/websites.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274343/#Comment_274343" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T14:23:58+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  2:23PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Olman, seems to me that the problem you pinpoint is basically that the judges (and the voting audience) are stoopid, and therefore they need to be forced to not compare free stuff with commercial game previews. To me it is utterly obvious that some quickstart guide can't by definition be the equal of a dedicated, complete roleplaying game as a noteworthy product, free or not - but as you say, apparently the judges and the voters disagree, and would rather emphasize whatever qualities those free quickstart booklets have over dedicated game design. Heck, without knowing anything about the Ennie awards I would've found it obvious that something like a quickstart guide would be left aside by the judges simply because it's just a marketing spin-off of another, larger product that is presumably already participating in the awards, instead of being a separate product by itself. Seems weird to me that essentially the same game can participate in the awards multiple times by getting sliced into marketing material; who believes that those quickstart booklets have been chosen on their own merits instead of the merits of their product lines?<br/><br/>This is a tragedy for the ambitious gaming scene to be sure, but it's also the nature of the awards: of course a fan-voted award will go to a WotC coffee mug over an excellent game made by a no-name small press outfit. There's not much to be done about that, it's the nature of a popularity competition. Even if additional rules were put into place to disqualify this or that or the other thing because of how obviously they are against the spirit of the category, that would not change the fundamental nature of the competition: the awards would still get awarded based on popularity. For this reason the only real cure for stupid nominee picks is to choose higher-caliber judges rather than try to fine-tune the judging criteria.<br/><br/>From this viewpoint it might be better to take the whole Ennie award system with a smirk, not worry too much about the categories and perhaps vote in the judge-selection procedure to favour judges who emphasize reason over fandom. The right person to exclude the latest WW quickstart booklet from a category is the judge who chooses the nominees, not a predetermined rule: if a quickstart is not a <i>good</i> product, that is a reason for a judge to not pass it on as a nominee, not a reason to categorically refute all quickstart booklets from the awards. Of course, ironically enough, the judge-voting is also a popularity contest <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/> The judges make or break a voting set-up like this, as they're the only party capable of setting up an interesting and balanced popularity contest in each category by selecting products that make sense when matched against each other in the voting, so if the judges are making stupid decisions, perhaps that's the part of the system to fix instead of the categories themselves.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough I remember checking out the Ennies submission guidelines and deciding that a free Internet version of my TSoY books would not be admissible because the same product is available on paper, and you can't submit digital versions of things available on paper. Apparently I should have renamed the HTML version as "Shadows of Yesterday Quickstart" to participate after all <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274347">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274347/#Comment_274347" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T14:29:35+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  2:29PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2010 2:31PM by jenskot.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Full disclosure...

But I can offer a more general opinion. <br/><br/>If a person, group, or company's goal is monetary profit, it's commercial in nature. Something can technically be free and still be commercial. For example, many TV shows are paid for by advertising and merchandising and although technically free, are commercial in nature (with a few minor exceptions).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274382">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274382/#Comment_274382" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T16:21:39+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  4:21PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fair enough, Jason - I can totally believe that less WW is more, as you might guess <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> This is exactly why I wouldn't myself refute quickstarts or other possible free products categorically and in advance - if the category is to include the best free products, nothing less than an informed judgment by a person is going to cut it. The judgment will of course be awry for everybody disagreeing with the judge, but then you wouldn't need a judge if the choices were obvious.<br/><br/>Still, a judge I would consider good would take a bit of designer intent into account and leave out the marketing material products in favour of nominating full games made with passion. For my gaming values a "free product" category like the one posted by Olman above is quite a travesty in a world full of seriously designed, freely distributed games. But then again, the judges do not work from perfect information, they have to pick from products actually submitted to the awards. So it's a tricky task, and one not likely to result in any striking truths about the rpg publishing field.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_274385">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wordman" title="Wordman"><img alt="Wordman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://divnull.com/graphics/div0-32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wordman">Wordman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274385/#Comment_274385" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-03T16:46:24+00:00" title="June  3, 2010  4:46PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2010 4:46PM by Wordman.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with jenskot, except for the bit about "free sample supplements that you need a commercial product to play".

Almost everything I've ever released to the public for roleplaying games would fit in the "fan product" bucket. And, even though I released everything for free, almost none of it would fit into the "free game" bucket. Fan products are all about creating stuff that gives unofficial support to other people's products (free, commercial, doesn't matter). Free games are about making something new and different. Not only is the skill set much different, but the entire purpose, process and result is as well.<br/><br/>Now, supposing that the ENnies offer both "Best Fan Product" and "Best Free Game" as categories. Were there enough quality creations this year to fill up each of these categories? For free games, probably so (though I'd have to check the release dates of some of the ones I'm thinking about to be sure). For fan products, I'm not so sure, and that is a shame.<br/><br/>Last year, noticing that 2008 had a "best fan product" category, mostly on a whim I submitted a <a href="http://rpg.divnull.com/exalted/wad/" rel="nofollow">collective project for Exalted</a> to compete in that category for 2009. In the event, however, there were apparently not enough entries to support the "best fan product" category, so the 2009 awards didn't offer it. (They did have a "Best Free Product" category, however, which looked mostly to be a "Best Free Game" category, with some quickstart "pollution".) What was interesting to me about the whole thing is that of the people to whom I mentioned "hey, I submitted that fanboy thing to the ENies", <i>every single person</i> said "you can do that?". So, is it just that no one actually makes "fanboy things"? Or is it that people just don't submit them? I honestly don't know.

I'm not sure exactly how to craft those categories, but it might benefit the discussion to look at a slightly bigger picture than the commercial/noncommercial distinction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_274599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/274599/#Comment_274599" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-04T15:57:40+00:00" title="June  4, 2010  3:57PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Hi Tony,<br/><br/>Thanks for asking.<br/><br/>The level of quality in free products can be<a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/" rel="nofollow">very high</a>.
