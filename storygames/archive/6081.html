This morning it struck me that an IAWA-style Arthurian oracle might be a cool addition to the game.  The mechanic I have in mind is based on the tarot trick-taking games, so an oracle tuned to the full deck of major and minor arcana rather than a deck of playing cards would be optimal.<br/><br/>Any suggestions - either of oracle elements or how to go about creating the list of elements?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135804">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce" title="Dave Younce"><img alt="Dave Younce" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i57.photobucket.com/albums/g232/thomastamblyn/Avatars/GoPlayDice.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Younce">Dave Younce</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135804/#Comment_135804" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T08:22:51+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  8:22AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are you planning multiple oracles for the players to choose between when a chapter begins, or a single tarot-attuned oracle?<br/><br/>It seems like, for the arcana at least, you could just look into Arthurian stories and see what corresponds - Guinevere and Lancelot are pretty obviously The Lovers, right?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135832/#Comment_135832" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T10:06:21+00:00" title="March 21, 2008 10:06AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dave, thanks for your thoughts!<br/><br/>Honestly, the idea came together during my drive into work this morning, so I hadn't necessarially gotten as far as usage.  My goal would ultimately be to simplify the Dealer's job by providing them a theme to work within during a given session/story/chapter.  That said, I suspect your first suggestion of multiple oracles for the players to choose between when a chapter begins feels truer to my original impulses.<br/><br/>I agree that the traditional correspondences are one route, I even think I have seen an Arthurian tarot (my wife may own it, as I say that) that would make that fairly simple.  However, my initial impulse is to separate things a bit from the specifics of the existing legends - describe things in generic terms "an unfaithful spouse and a secret lover" rather than the specific.  That may be me trying to get too clever, however.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135874">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DainXB" title="DainXB"><img alt="DainXB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DainXB">DainXB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135874/#Comment_135874" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T16:48:08+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  4:48PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I definitely am in the camp of using 'generic terms' in oracles -- but not <i>too</i> generic.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Saying  'a knight challenging everyone he meets', 'an unfaithful spouse and a secret lover', or 'a knight riding out on a quest' seems too generic, and a little bland.  Saying 'The Black Knight' or 'Guinevere and Lancelot' or 'Galahad' is definitely too specific, because it constrains the players too much.  So shoot for the middle ground, give some concrete detail to hang the imagination on, but let the entry remain flexible.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>A knight in black-enameled armor, camped by a river-ford, challenging all who would cross to a joust.<br/>A spouse, whose long-hidden attraction for a secret admirer has recently blossomed into passion -- and infidelity, <br/>A young knight, innocent and pure of heart, riding forth on a dangerous quest.<br/>An enchantress with long, flowing sable hair and eyes that glitter like wicked diamonds, mesmerizing all who look into them.<br/>A circle of stones, moss-encrusted and ancient, site of mystic rituals.<br/><br/>The details -- the black armor, the campsite, the <i>recent</i> blossoming of passion, the purity of heart, the long flowing sable hair and glittering eyes, the mossy stones -- aren't exactly generic, but they aren't very constraining either.  They provide (hopefully) just enough of a spark to give the players something for their imaginations to work with.  My last two examples are obviously drawn from Morgan le Fay and Stonehenge, respectively -- but they can be used to generate other, similar, Arthurian content.<br/><br/>Anyway, I hope this advice helps.  I look forward to seeing your oracle.  Good luck!<br/><br/>--<br/>DainXB                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik" title="Valvorik"><img alt="Valvorik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valvorik">Valvorik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135892/#Comment_135892" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-21T18:55:38+00:00" title="March 21, 2008  6:55PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think it's also good if fairly frequently characters are described with loaded terms (e.g., the champion is bellowing) that suggest emotional states or drives that put them "in motion" when picked up.<br/><br/>Buidling on Chris Chinn's observation that good (not easily going to end) conflict happens when someone is Desperate, Overreacting, Violent, Irresponsible, Immoral, Irrational/Fanatical, Hiding Something, Jealous, Besotted etc.<br/><br/>Rob                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_135925">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Blue" title="Blue"><img alt="Blue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Blue">Blue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135925/#Comment_135925" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-22T04:59:38+00:00" title="March 22, 2008  4:59AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good advice, all - thanks                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
