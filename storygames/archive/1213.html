                    So when Mike Sugarbaker interviewed me for the OgreCave audio report, I had no idea what I would end up saying.  I managed to surprise myself by talking a bit about the possibility of "non-commercial roleplaying."  I'm not entirely sure where this came from, but I'm going to hazzard a few guesses.<br/><br/>If you've read Eero Tuovinen's contribution to <i>Push</i> vol 1, you know of his concerns that English-language (and, typically, American) roleplaying publishers are dominating Finnish tabletop and the tabletop communities of many other European countries where English is widely spoken.  I think Japan is probably insulated from a lot of this, partially for lingusitic reasons (I should ask Andy).  In any case, one of the major points that Eero made is that the Nordic larp movement is, in many ways, a reaction against American commercialization and commodification of roleplaying, because you can't really make good money off a larp, though Mind's Eye Theatre certainly tries.  Nordic larps are generally not published commercially, but exist, in my understanding, mostly in the notes of those planning the larp and in the memories of the people who participated in it.  <br/><br/>This, to me, is fascinating, and definitely indicates a community that's centered more around play than publishing, which is a weakness of the Anglo-American indie tabletop community, in my mind. Despite the Forge and Story Games' attempts to focus on Actual Play, we are largely about publishing and, more importantly, selling printed game texts.  While we may wish it was different, games published for free (or for cost) online do not get as much attention or play as those sold as print products. Many people still don't seem to consider free or PDF games to be "real publishing," which is a damn shame.  Here is a place where the indie community could be really subversive, I think, by breaking down the idea that a $50 tome has more value than a free PDF or something Kevin Allen Jr. photocopied at Kinkos.  Or that more expensive products are necessaily better one. Or that games you pay for deserve to be played more (which is often what happens).<br/><br/>I'm aware that more and more people are looking to beat the mainstream publishers at their own gamebook-as-artifact game, as products like <i>Nobilis</i> and (especially) <i>Burning Empires</i> clearly illustrate. That's cool and certainly subversive in another way.  It's cool to show people that you don't need underpaid creators and/or the backing of Hasbro in order to make beautiful books.<br/><br/>However, I am personally worried about the increasing entry-level costs (as well as time commitment) to be involved in roleplaying.  It means that roleplaying will even more be the domain of people with lots of disposable income who are already interested in really dorky things, which is a needlessly limited market.  Also, it limits people's ability to get to know a whole host of different games and play styles, because they have a limited amoutn of funds to spend on gaming.<br/><br/>Even more damaging, there's the pervasive idea that <i>if you want to be a better player/GM, you should buy more roleplaying products</i>, which is the biggest, stupidest fallacy I can possibly think of.  Roleplaying should not be thought of like a damn CCG, where buying more or better cards makes you more effective.  Roleplaying should be accssible to anyone with the inclination and an overactive imagination.  Hell, you shouldn't need to buy printed texts about roleplaying in order to roleplay.  There already are awesome free games available online, but most of us are saving our best work to be released in print where we can sell it and make a little extra money on the side.<br/><br/>So here's a subversive idea.  None of us are really in this for the money.  It's a nice bonus for putting out a good product, sure, but it's not necessary to our daily survival (except maybe in Ben's case) and we could certainly do without it.  What if we began releasing really awesome games either 1) for free or 2) really cheap.  If you need an ideology to get behind, here's the "Cheap Art Manifesto" of the Bread &amp; Puppet Theatre.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.aisling.net/pix/cheapartmanifesto2.gif"/> </div>

                            (cont.)<br/><br/>Finally, here's an even more subversive idea, once which I don't think we're ready for yet. What would tabletop roleplaying look like if it stopped being text-based in the way it traditionally has been?  What if it was more like the Nordic larp movement, where games were just notes on scraps of paper and the important thing was not owning them or reading them but participating in them?  As an example: imagine a world where Meg Baker and Paul Czege came to GenCon and instead of selling us copies of <i>1001 Nights</i> and <i>Bacchanal</i>, they just taught us the games, transmitting them as oral traditions.  And then we went home and taught the games to the people we knew.  What would it be like if the practice of roleplaying was transmitted <b>as a practice</b> instead of in the imperfect medium of the written word, something that often fails to capture the power of actual play?<br/><br/>And that's what I've been thinking about recently.                        </div>

Of the freeform larps that I've read, I wouldn't call any of them 'mechanically complex', which is where the American tradition of RPGs comes from.  Can you imagine trying to pass on something like red-box D&amp;D by memory?  They just come from different places.  In the beginning, RPGs were little more than you describe - notes photocopied from hand to hand.  But the market matures and sophisticates.  I'm not saying that larps aren't sophisticated, but they've simply taken a different route where their sophistication is in the execution (run-time) instead of the design-time phase.  So there's no need for excessive documentation.  And once you need the atoms, you'll find people willing to sell those atoms to other people.<br/><br/>Certainly you can make the case for non-commercial RPGs.  I played in an RPG whose entire ruleset was 'roll the occassional d6 if the impact on the story is unsettled or largely due to chance'.  We played a tentative ARG, meeting outside of the gaming table to talk to each other in-character in coffee shops and the like.  Certainly there was a craft to it - mainly in remembering what the hell you said to people so that you didn't contradict yourself later on.<br/><br/>I applaud the anti-commercial push - and look at TSoY.  Great game, all free.                        </div>

                            Sure, you can't carry Red Box D&amp;D in your head; that's probably why freeform rules the tabletop at Israeli cons.<br/>
I can make an old-timer rant about how we couldn't really be consumerist here, because we didn't have distributors, but that's no longer a relevant point.<br/>
Tangentially, a community oriented around play rather than print probably also tends to have a healthier Male/Female ratio, but maybe the age distribution also has something to do with that. In that respect, Gencon is probably handicapped by not being within a two hour bus ride of most gamers in the country, not to mention its lack of lawn and hookas.                        </div>

Ok, this seems like a challenge. I remember learning red-box D&amp;D orally, and I bet I could make a passable game if I had to do it again. Design challenge is percolating: in one week, write down the rules to red box D&amp;D as you remember them without looking at the source material at all.<br/><br/>I'm quite sorry to interrupt the thread, so I'll contribute to make it up: I listened to Jonathan's interview today as well and it was quite good. As a total pinko, I agree that our community turning into the giant money machine is not necessarily a positive thing, although the pragmatic part of me wonders if we would have had the innovation that we've had without the money. I'm trying to skirt the line by providing my games for free while selling the books as a product. My free versions have been lacking, however - and I'm going to change that soon.                        </div>

                            If you'll permit me an indulgence, I'd label the (indie) RPG community pseudo-commercial at best -- much like SCA historical recreationists.  Sure, there are people in the SCA that make stuff (mostly garb) and sell it, even make a pretty penny off of it, but generally speaking, you don't actually have to buy anything to participate.  To my eye, RPGs and especially indie RPGs fit this model perfectly.  There are some folks making a little cash here and there, but the <em>vast majority</em> of the hobby is spending little to nothing to participate.                        </div>

                            The problem with oral tradition compared to printed (at least electronically) is the loss of information. Sure, in many cases, it may not be significant. But in other cases it may be quite significant.<br/><br/>That said, back in college, there were several Cold Iron campaigns running, and a complete text has never been published. There was a fairly complete, and mostly accurate, tome of spells. The skill tables were published. And there was a basic set of combat rules. But there were lots of combat options that were passed on by oral tradition. It may have been true that a few people dismissed the game because it was unpublished, but overall, the game had wide acceptance. Of course removed from the environment the game grew up in, it hs become impossible to get the game running successfully, because so much of the style of play has never been published. Players who were introduced to the game by joining a campaign that included seasoned players quickly picked up on some of the strategies of the game.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>

I suspect that you've imagined the distant past and the apocalyptic future of roleplaying games. Once Moms sat around parlors with the neighborhood daughters and told stories and had rules for participation. The "game" materialized and disappeared in a single evening. If it recurred, you could be sure that the "rules" would be different every time. Sometime in the distant future, this will once again be the sole way these games are transmitted. That and 9 year old boy's clubhouses.<br/>
<br/>
That said, the written word and printed matter are an excellent and far more efficient method of transmitting ideas and engendering thought in your intended audience. Just ask The Bible. Art and graphic design also have a similar beneficial effect of creating mood and sparking the imagination.<br/>
<br/>
And, while I was once a hippy pinko idealist like yourself and Clinton, I no longer suffer under the illusion that money and commerce are inherently bad or that I must starve for my art to make it good. All life is suffering, therefore I am capable of making driven, thematic art while living comfortably and profiting from my effort. In fact, my art is so god damned fucking good, that I now <i>expect</i> payment for it. Why such arrogance? Why do I propagate the system? Because fuck all I don't want to spend 10 hours a day for the rest of my dumb ass life slaving away for some awful motherfucker so I can pay the rent and feed myself and then, when I've recovered from the numbness and shellshock of work, have two whole hour a day to myself to work on my art.<br/>
<br/>
In the culture in which we live, commerce is freedom. Right o, conjure up those images of thoughtless, soulless corporations grinding down the masses with their jack-booted jackhammers! Don't think for a minute of an artist able to support himself in New York City because he dares to sell his music or whatever.<br/>

<p>I think that is selling the diversity and beauty of games short.</p>
<p>It is <em>awesome</em> that games can be part of the oral tradition, to move and change effortlessly, but it is also awesome that we can make beautiful, irreplacable things with our hands, and these things are games we can play with. I think that <em>discarding</em> either in favor of the other is destructive.</p>

                            As a designer, once your game is released in the wild it isn't yours any more.

RPGs already do this, really.  I guess I'm wondering what the difference between Johnathan's idea and the local-level remixing that's part and parcel of the play of any RPG is, other than some sort of hippie mimeograph sneakernet.<br/><br/>(He said with love and affection.)                        </div>

                            Anyone google "rpg" recently?  Aside from videogames, you'll also pull up several links to forum games and online chat games- hundreds of them, mostly based on popular movies, anime, comic books, etc., and they far outnumber the number of folks playing online anything that has ever had anything to do with what we define as the rpg industry or hobby.  Sure, they're usually playing some kind of freeform or GM fiat game with perhaps a few extra stats thrown on, but they're playing, and they're playing for free.                        </div>

                            You know what, though?<br/><br/>On the Saturday after GenCon I went to the farmers' market here in Greenfield. I had cash in my pocket that people had given me in exchange for my book. I bought some local veggies and some local honey, Meg bought some herbal bath salts from our friend Julia, the kids bought some locally baked cookies, and from a woman with a guitar and a portable amp I bought a CD she'd made herself.<br/><br/>I contend that a genuinely hand-to-hand, sustainable, human-scale economy is way more subversive than free art. This way we ALL get vegetables, and screw the man right in his stupid ear.                        </div>

                            To reign in my initial overenthusiasm a little...<br/><br/>I'm saying this partially because I get to go to work every day and research Chinese cults (Ken Hite would give his right arm for my job), before coming home to work on games. I don't ever plan on having game design be a major source of income, much less a full time job.  I already love what I do.  If things were different, if I was working as a wage slave, I might feel very differently about it.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to be One Size Fits All, One True Way about this.  Obviously some games are not going to work as well transmitted orally.  But I think I'd be cool if there were more that could be.  I'm not trying to tell people they give away their blood, sweat, and tears for free.  That's obviously their own business.  I'm trying to lay out the advantages in approaching things differently or planning different products with different distribution tactics and audiences in mind, instead of always going with the "let's print some books and sell them" approach.<br/><br/>One thing to consider: free or easily-taught games see more online and casual play.  My experience with playing in online chat games is that we played 100% more of <a href="http://www.septemberquestion.org/lumpley/other.html" rel="nofollow">Otherkind</a> and <a href="http://www.harlekin-maus.com/games/shadows/shadows.html" rel="nofollow">Shadows</a> than we would have if we were playing face-to-face.  <br/><br/>Likewise, one of the reasons that freeform dominates online play is because of the low barrier to entry.  When I was organizing and running <i>In Nomine</i> PBeM games (which I did for the 2+ years before I found the Forge), there were always lots of people who were interested in playing, as long as we assured them that they didn't have to own/read the books in order to play.  They just read the descriptions of <i>In Nomine</i> on the website and went at it.  Some of them bought the books later, but nobody bought <i>In Nomine</i> so they could play in an online freeform game.  I would argue that we are missing our chance to reach this audience by offering mostly print products.  This is not an audience we could make a ton of money from, since it's generally a non-commercial audience, but it's more sizable than the indie gaming audience in lots of ways and one worth considering for some projects.<br/><br/>And Ben's right.  We've had a small number of influencial free games: Fudge, The Pool, Fate, Risus, Engel Matrix, Active Exploits, etc.  Those are awesome.  We should do more of that, from time to time, instead of pushing towards print as the default.  Clinton's doing some valuable stuff in that department, but there are definitely other ways of making things freely available.<br/><br/>I guess I was really inspired by playing <i>Bacchanal</i> and <i>1001 Nights</i>.  I feel like, with the right kind of demo and some pneumonic devices, that I wouldn't need to consult the text at all in order to play those games.  And that's POWER.  Think of the sheer transportability!  I would be able to play <i>Baccahanal</i> or <i>1001</i> whenever I was in a place that had dice, with zero preperation or forethought.  And I could teach it to others and spread it like a virus (or a meme).  It's like designing a cult instead of a game, designing a practice that will replicate itself because it's addictive and cool (like the way Jungle Speed totally p0wnd the indie game community at GenCon this year).                        </div>

Ah! Yeah, that's a <i>thing</i>.<br/><br/>Maybe half the non-RPG games I regularly play I have only from playing them, no text I've ever read. Foremost among them, Eat Poop You Cat, but also In the Manner of the Adverb, Crossed/Uncrossed, that dice game whose name I can't remember, Speed Scrabble, Murray Hula, others.<br/><br/>Adding some good RPGs to the list? Hell yeah. I'd submit my own game Matchmaker ... except nobody plays it.                        </div>

<i>Falling Leaves</i> makes for excellent oral transmission. It was taught to me by BankueiChris, and I've taught it to a few friends. I tried reading the Forge thread that started it, but either the version I was taught differed from the text or [more likely] Chris had been following the development of the thread, because what I was taught was pretty different from the original post.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Shreyas Sampat</cite>I think that is selling the diversity and beauty of games short.</blockquote>
I'm with Shreyas on this.<br/><br/>One thing I love about Indie RPGs is the whole "geek folk art" aspect of them. I do think that the tent is big enough for everything from the oral traditions and free PDFs to the gorgeous artbooks and games with nifty accessories. The latter, under the present state of things, are pretty much commercial ventures by necessity. But, on the other hand, with the channels of distribution and the means of communication, there's no reason not to do more the former.<br/><br/>If the DIY, rules-you-can-learn-by-heart thing is your passion, fan it. I love free games and don't see them as disposable or devalued. I love the fact that I can be entertained and entertain in a non-passive way without having to be engaged in commerce.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not any kind of pinko and I don't think making money is a dirty thing to do. I'm also not a rabid capitalist and I don't think giving away something for the sheer love is insane, either.  I just don't think it has to be one or the other for the whole community or even individuals.<br/><br/>That said, I'm personally down with making and playing more folk/DIY stuff 100%.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kuma</cite><br/>RPGs already do this, really.  I guess I'm wondering what the difference between Johnathan's idea and the local-level remixing that's part and parcel of the play of any RPG is, other than some sort of hippie mimeograph sneakernet. (He said with love and affection.)</blockquote>
What differentiates this from sneakernet is that I want the recipients to be on the same plane as the original authors, in terms of their ability to rework and redistribute. One of the big disappointments for me was that the OGL never fulfilled its promise -- that you could take OGL stuff and rework it as lightly or deeply as needed for your application. This didn't pan out, basically because far too many game publishers were paranoid and did their best to put out stuff that technically complied with the license but put as many roadblocks as possible in the way of actual reuse (mostly via the "product identity" clauses). That kind of paranoia is destructive. In the case of the OGL, it arose from the fear of competition sucking away sales. But it can arise from noncommercial motives as well, such as a belief in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_rights" rel="nofollow">moral right of an author</a> to prevent modification to his or her work. <br/><br/>If you look at the way Lexicon is played, you'll notice very quickly that most games take the whole text of the rules, post it on their site, and then revise it to suit local taste. This is awesome, because it means that the game rules are a living thing not frozen in stone by some broken concept of artistic integrity.                        </div>

                            Just to add something to Chris's point, I know I've talked on SG before about the adult-literacy classes that folks like Malcom Sheppard and I have taught in which we've found lots of students who are big D&amp;D players. <br/><br/>Many (most) of them play some version of old boxed D&amp;D or 1st ed AD&amp;D -- and because of the literacy situation almost all of them play them from memory and by oral and practical transmission. One member of the group usually has some of the books, but they are consulted rarely or not at all. <br/><br/>So yes, it is actually possible to play D&amp;D from memory. Especially if you have an oral culture background. <br/><br/>One other issue, which Jonathan raised, and I'd like to underline: <br/><br/>In our society money is often equated with value. In RPGs specifically I have seen this many times with folks who release free games only to get a small to non-existant response to their work outside it's home community. When these folks then go on to put their game on something like rpgnow and charge money for it the response goes up. People become more willing to spend their time (which for many is in shorter supply than money) on something that they have to pay for, because the association is that things that you have to pay for are better, and that you have to get the value of your money from them.<br/><br/>There are exceptions to this, of course. But I still sometimes wonder if FATE would get more play if people had to pay for the rules.                        </div>

If I can get away with some shameless (though on-topic) self-promotion here, <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/unistat.pdf" rel="nofollow">Unistat</a> is free. It's also easily transmitted orally. The thing only has four rules, after all.<br/>
<br/>
It's free for two main reasons. First, as a product, it's pretty scant -- just one double-sided page. I don't see any reason to charge for a product like that, since anyone can replicate it on their own. Second, I have a distaste for charging for ideas. Services or products, sure, but not ideas.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have any specific copyright on the game, but if someone wanted to pass it on to someone else, changing it in the process, that's cool. Heck, if they want to take the <i>idea</i> and turn it into a <i>product</i> that they sell...well, good for them. Dunno if this makes me some commie hippie or just lazy.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JonathanWalton</cite>In any case, one of the major points that Eero made is that the Nordic larp movement is, in many ways, a reaction against American commercialization and commodification of roleplaying, because you can't really make good money off a larp, though Mind's Eye Theatre certainly tries.  Nordic larps are generally not published commercially, but exist, in my understanding, mostly in the notes of those planning the larp and in the memories of the people who participated in it.</blockquote>
I haven't yet listened the audio report or read Eero's article, but here are few points which spring into my mind.<br><br>Nordic larps are usually tailored for the occasion; they are not commercially viable because there's very little to sell, except for the experience. You'll invest a lot of time and energy to great that one larp, but for the players, that's just a one-day or a weekend long event, from which they pay a small amount of money which can - though usually does not - cover the organisers expenses. There can be some rerun-value for the event, but generally this is not done. I'm not sure if it's really a counter-argument for US-lead commercial roleplaying; perhaps it's more based on the fact that when live-action roleplaying started, there wasn't any commercial material available and people had to learn everything the hard way. And when the first products became available (like MET), it was quickly found out that they didn't really suit the already evolved Nordic way of larping at all. Later on, some of this attitude/difference can be seen on tabletop scene as well.<br><br>There are very few published "rules" or larp books in general, since the larps are usually built from a scratch, based on previous experience and the mentioned oral tradition. You don't run games as such (with the exception of MET which has been used), you create events and tailor everything to suit that particular event.<br><br/>One might be able to make a commercially succesful larp, but no one really tries to do this because there's some kind of "everything should be free or at least as cheap as possible"-mentality in Nordic gaming circles. Plus, players usually invest in props and costumes and whatnot. This is slowly changing, though mostly so that players are willing to invest more into a larp event but simultaneously except more bangs for their bucks. So the events are more elegant and provide better, say, food than they used to - but they still manage only to cover their expenses.<br/><br/>And it's not a bad thing, I think - it's a hobby, something that people do because they want to, not because they expect to make a living out of it. Some of this can also be seen in tabletop playing circles, especially with folks that have been doing larps for a long time. A lot tabletop games - I don't know if it's a majority or not - in these circles are built and run in the same way that larps are; they are tailor-made (and usually freeformish in style, since there's little reason to design mechanics - also a social contract issue) and not based on any published game, except maybe shamelessly ripping of the setting and some themes.<br/><br/>About the oral tradition; I've never visited a, say, US gaming convention, but I've been lead to believe that they are quite different from conventions around here. Nordic conventions are not a place to sell anything, with the exception of some hobby stores and few indie-publishers. There is gaming, of course, but a lot of the effort goes into organising programme; panels, lectures, workshops and the stuff. The oral tradition is strong and this is where the knowledge moves around. Also, the unoffical, enlightening discussions happening in pubs is a major contributor, here.<br/><br/>I've been thinking about writing something about how's and why's of designing a "traditional" Nordic larp and how the why's (and how's, probably) have affected the tabletop playing as well. I just haven't figured out where to start and how to make it approachable.                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            This is well timed for me since I'm figuring out how to publish City of Birds. Free is very appealing...but you have to choose a publishing method that fits your goals in the environment you find yourself in. If charging money equals sales and play in America, then charging is just a means to an end.<br/><br/>Imagine that RPG designers are like traveling story-tellers, and wander between villages, teaching people to play their games. (That would be great, wouldn't it?) If you did that, would it makes sense for the people to offer you food and a bed in exchange for your visit, plus probably some gifts? If it's a money economy, would it make sense for them to chip in and pay you something? I'd say yes. Generally, we can't travel around like that today, of course, but in lieu of doing so, we can offer printed -- and now digital -- explanations of how to play our games. It's not the same as an oral tradition, but it has the same purpose, and it seems it warrants payment in the same way, if to a lesser extent.<br/><br/>That line of thought makes charging money less unpalatable to me, anyway. Plus what Vincent said.                        </div>

                            Okay, a couple different things:<br/><br/>First, I so love the dream of the traveling roleplayer.  There is something touching about it, and it makes me consider how storytelling functions more broadly.  Sure, the storyteller tells the tale, but there is usually a bitof call and response, and I can't imagine that afterwards you don't get kids who listen acting out (roleplaying!) scenes and characters.  Provide just the lightest touch of rules to that and...I don't know, it just seems promising.  Heck, provide them with key phrases (when someone says x...) to keep it in that distinctive oral-social-physical space.<br/><br/>About money, though: I keep thinking of something I read about Gurdjieff (there is a name I never thought I would use in conversation) about why he charged money, about what psychoanalysts like Lacan say about money, about Marx and the question of modes of production.  <br/><br/>For us (and I use us lightly here, so if you are not part of this us, party on), money is the outer representation of work.  It isn't just a symbol of it, it is a real dimension of my work.  For someone who works in the field, that outer representation also encompasses (and may be more intensely so) their crops.  For a painter, that outer representation encompasses their painting.  If you don't pay something that serves as an outer representation of your work, you are basically saying *to yourself* that this is not a work-worthy object.  I'll even suggest that those who have not worked for their money do not have it as one of their 'outer representations' for investing.<br/><br/>Now human scale economies are wonderful, because the work for work dimension is so real, so close to the surface.  I give you this, product of my labor, for that, product of your labor.  I don't think anything should be *really* free, although I am all about seeing that cost being more than just money.                        </div>

                            I think that the idea of RPGs as orally transmitted is interesting, but there's one big consideration. Do you think that if we start giving away these games for free, or doing the oral tradition thing, that more people will play these RPGs or less? Now, you may not care how many people play these RPGs. If that's the case, if you just want your game to be a Forge Tribe activity, great. <br/><br/>But the fact is that the system we live in expects that to be good, something needs a pricetag. Let's not debate whether or not this is a good thing. Simply put, not charging for RPGs isn't going to overthrow capitalism. It's not even going to be a first step along a path of a thousand steps. All it's going to do is stop people from playing these good games. <br/><br/>My best game design to date is called Synthesis. It's available for free with some GNU-like license that JB Bell, the co-author, convinced me to put on it. To date the game has seen almost no actual play. <br/><br/>Best work + No price = No play. <br/><br/>Doesn't make any sense, but that's the nature of this particular beast. As Vincent points out, I think it's a lot more subversive to work inside the system that's available to us to get people to play the good games we make. I mean, this is "Indie" already, right? Already subversive in that it doesn't subscribe to the idea that you have to be on the supplement treadmill to make a going thing of an RPG? And that sort of thing? <br/><br/>We need to be more subversive than we already are? To what end? Or is this subversiveness for subversiveness' sake. I thought it was about getting good RPGs played. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

                            (Jukka, if you want to write something about the process of constructing a Nordic larp, I'd love to publish something like that in <i>Push</i>.  Thanks for the clarification and extra info, in any case.)<br/><br/>Ian, that makes me wonder about an economy based around exchanging creative works rather than selling books.  We already see this a little bit between various indie publishers at GenCon, where people exchange printed copies of their games.  If we had games that sould be transmitted as practice/oral tradition then you could easily say, "Here, I'll teach you my Game X if you teach me your Game Y."  Or, like, Annie Rush could send me an awesome doodle instead of paying for her copy of <i>Push</i> 2.  Or I could write her a 24-hour game in exchange for a copy of <i>Run Robot Red</i>.  In that way, it really does become about creative exchange and sharing in the sense that Vincent was sorta trying to get at.<br/><br/>There's a lot more here to think about, and I'm really excited this thread is happening.  You folks rock.                        </div>

<p>A lot of this is why I started the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=615" rel="nofollow">"When is a game Published?"</a> thread a while back. This also gives me a few ideas.</p>
<p><em>Promotion.</em> What commercial games have suceeded without a promotional push, at least in the form of public feedback and convention/store presence? What non-commercial games have been given a similar amount of promotion; and then, how successful have they been? Maybe this is a key difference.</p>
<p>Many kinds of promotion (such booths at conventions) requires money, and I can't recommend spending money to promote a entirely revenue-free game. That said, consider Wushu: Dan Bayn (and esp. the first tier of fans) have done healthy promotion of the game while there's been a very light commercial availability in the past (and the game is effectively free now). For all that, Wushu has decent reputation, as an indie game.</p>
<p><em>Post-commercial Play.</em> I can think of <em>lots</em> of gamers who bought copies of a few White Wolf games a while back, and were never too drawn to the supplement bandwagon; instead, they mashup their own worlds into modified WW systems, and can just play on without much commercial input. These gamers may buy new material as inspirational material, but their play is not coupled to their commercial choices. In fact, many, many gamers fit into this mode successfully. It's not explicitly non-commercial, but it's something similar.</p>
<p><em>Events.</em> The "GenCon push" has been a push for many indie designers to give themselves a firm deadline to finish and playtest a game, apply some gorgeous polish, and finally put it out as "done". There's not a good similar analog for driving non-commercial games towards saying: "this game I've made is done, polished, out, it's a full game that you can engage with".</p>
<p>So what if we had an online "event" called, uh, "FreeNerdCon". We set up a FreeNerdCon blog, and every day in the week a few new, polished, free games are featured and basically pitched. So like a Forge Booth, but electronic and free. (This is conjecture, not necessarily a call to arms. Just think about: would this encourage more polish and more <em>play</em> of non-commercial games?)</p>

                            Dev, you latter suggestion sounds awesome and would definitely convince me to polish up (and even do pretty layout for) some of the games I've already released for free, as well as creating new works.  Maybe we just need an online respository for "professional quality" (whatever that means) free games and a bunch of people who are seriously interested in playing them.  Because, man, if you can build a rabid audience, I'm sure more people would be willing to create specifically for them.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>But the fact is that the system we live in expects that to be good, something needs a pricetag. Let's not debate whether or not this is a good thing. Simply put, not charging for RPGs isn't going to overthrow capitalism. It's not even going to be a first step along a path of a thousand steps. All it's going to do is stop people from playing these good games.<br/></blockquote>
I don't care whether this is good because I don't think it's <em>true</em>. Brand wondered above whether FATE would see more play if it weren't free. I don't think it would, because I don't think it would <em>exist</em> if FUDGE, its ancestor, weren't a free game. FUDGE would be just another totally forgotten early-90s small press rpg design, were it not for the fact that anyone can have it for free, and that everyone is encouraged to rebuild and customize it as needed. I do agree that the existence of a community with a free-software-style ethos is really, really helpful, but that's something we can make. Likeiwise, Lexicon took off primarily because it was free and attached to a community that had that ethos -- charging for it would have killed it. <br/><br/>As an aside, I've never heard of Synthesis before now, and yeah, on a quick read through it looks really good. I especially like the idea of recursive conflicts, and will have to play it. Maybe you should stick a link to it in a sig line or something?                        </div>

                            I think success is its own trap here. Once a player gets excited about a game, whether it's in his head or in a book, he wants to get more of it. And he is disappointed when there is not more of it to get and he has absorbed it all. Don't ask me why people feel this way, but they do. There's a reason the supplement treadmill still sells books.                        </div>

                            Knowing everything I have learned over the past several years of supporting a free game, I can say this.<br/><br/>If we were to release Fate today, we would still do it as a free PDF.  That's worked for us, and it's brought a lot of secondary benefits that we're happy with.  However, we would also release it as a POD through lulu, and charge enough that we make some money off each sale.  <br/><br/>This latter point was not always true.  Until recently, we probably would have just said "Hey, we're nto in this to make money, let's just break even at sell it at cost."  Nothing wrong with that, but for a lot of reasons including an improved understanding of how the industry works and certain issues that came up when Fred was pricing DRYH I'm a lot more comfortable with the fact that a (non-gauging) price hurts no one.<br/><br/>I have no business case to back this model.  There are benefits to a free product (Potentially wider audience) but there are also benefits to charging  for it (perceived value, greater return per item) and i dont' pretend to know which is the right answer.  What I _do_ know is that if a designer has thought through what model they want, there has never been a better time to create and release your product in whatever shape and model you have decided upon.  These tools and options didn't exist even a few years ago (much to my chagrin) so if you want to spread some cheap art, or even if you don't, now is the time.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I am a mercenary bastard. <br/><br/>I do have a free game or two, but these are the projects I've devoted about 2 weeks or less to. They aren't my best work but they aren't total crap either. I can write off the "expense" in time as promotional, same with the songs I let loose. They're a demo, an advertisement of myself that I hope will one day see a return.<br/><br/>I want people to pay for Contract Work because the time I've spent on it elevates it beyond a "hobby" in my mind. When I do earn money from my music, it goes back into more gear for more music. If I earn any money from my game, that will be the fund for the next one. I know I can't live off these income streams, so I'll turn them around and around. Also, to mitigate the inhuman qualities of wanting to make money off a book about murder, a percentage of any profits (25% or more) will be donated to a charitable organization devoted to eliminating gun violence in inner city communities.<br/><br/>I can't believe that art should be free. My wife's a freelance illustrator, that's how she earns her money. If she did her art for free, for a hobby, we'd have starved to death years ago.                        </div>

                            Y'all realize that you're talking about making RPGs inaccessible to the general populace, right? This is rockstar economics, in which only the most celebrated (not necessarily best) designer/player/organizer/GMs will ever make a living (or even a supplemental income)from their creative work, and only those who have sufficient leisure and disposable income will be able to afford to "keep up" with the "scene."

                            You know, when webcomics first took flight, there was a lot of awkward flailing happening with regards to how to make money off the damned things. While the medium is still very young, some of the smoke has cleared and the money-making method that's stuck is this: Put the comics up for free and make your cash off of ads and merchandise like t-shirts and published versions of the comic. It's the peripheral stuff around the comic that makes the cash.<br/><br/>Now, shoving the square peg of indie RPGs into the round hole of this scenario is a bit rough, but I think it bears some thought. Seems like putting a downloadable, plain-jane pdf of the rules up on your site is a good way to get people interested and trying out a game. Throw some ads up on the download page, hell, throw some IN the pdf (confining them to one page or something). If it takes off, get that nice, printed edition done. Get some t-shirts printed using some of the great art in the printed version, sell em on the site. Go to town. I barely know what Dogs in the Vineyard is, but from the way it's talked about hereabouts, I imagine, some cool, clever t-shirts related to it would move well.<br/><br/>I sound like a money-grubbin' fool, when I'm anything but. I actually feel bad charging people for my art. I do understand the need to make a little back so your passion doesn't become a millstone, though. I imagine it costs a pretty penny to get those big, slick RPG books printed.<br/><br/>Slight deraily question: Have any of you tried hooking up with an indie/small press comic convention and touting your wares there? These things are booming right now and are popping up in a lot of places. Integrate, I say. These are your people, too, they just don't know it yet.                        </div>

                            Just to be very clear, I am with the Luke / Mark W / Jennifer crowd in terms of the importance of charging money, making a living, and the dangers of an 'all free' model.  <br/><br/>However, that said, our good Mr. Walton, at least, is not advocating the exact opposite.  He is (on reflection) saying that there is something cool about doing something in addition to for-profit ventures.  He also specifies that he has a wicked cool day job that he would not give up for game design, so he is in a nifty position of having design as a ('pure') hobby.  <br/><br/>I would compare this to something like the gardener compared to the farmer--nothing wrong with gardening and giving away your veggies for free, although clearly an all-gardening approach to farming would be profoundly problematic.<br/><br/>Similarly, too, the farmer doesn't need to worry about the fact that there are gardeners giving away produce for free.  The two are working along different lines--again, the difference between a gardening competition and a conference on the best farming methods.  <br/><br/>They aren't in competition with each other, they aren't either/or equations.  They are different things, on different levels, which nonetheless may still inform each other.  Every once in a while, a gardener does something nifty a farmer can exploit, just as (more frequently) a farmer has some developed technique a gardener can adapt to a smaller scale.                        </div>

<p>Not to put words in Mark's mouth, but, let's consider the implications of free games.</p>
<p>If I choose not to make any money from a game, that means that I am going to choose not to sink significant amounts of money into producing, advertising, disseminating that game. It is a thing that will necessarily live on random web hits and word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>Word-of-mouth is not especially inclusive.</p>
<p>That's my reading of Mark's statements.</p>
<p>Also, I am sensing a factionalisation here, where I don't think there really need to be one - as I and Ian have said before, these things aren't opposed or mutually exclusive.</p>

                            Oh, man, the upset is totally reasonable.  The problem is that the _reasons_ a game might be free are so varied.  Look at the three big reasons to offer a game for free: <br/>1. The creator considers it "undone" or a minimal effort, and offers it for free because she's not going to do anything further with it (or more generally, if I just don't want to bother).<br/>2. The creator has a philosophical (open source, say) or tactical (Offer core for free, sell supplements) reason why they feel the game should be free.<br/>3. The creator doesn't feel anyone would pay money for their product.<br/><br/>1 and 2 have in common that they recognize that the creator's work has intrinisic value, and that this thing being offered for free is an abberation.  In the case of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, it is free because it is incomplete or lacking compared to other products which would be worth somethign because they're complete.  In <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a>, there's a tacit acceptance that the product has value, but the creator is actively choosing to set that value aside for some secodnary reason.  Honestly, if all free products were free for reasons 1 and 2, I don't think there woudl be any issue of consternation.<br/><br/>The problem is that <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is poison.  <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> devalues the work of the creator and, implicitly, all other created work.  <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> is a declaration that the work _is_ being offered at a fair value, and that value is _nothing_.  Not only is that incredibly self destructive, it is destructive to anyone else who pursues the same sort of creation, because it devalues that _type_ of effort across the board.<br/><br/>Now, outside of free, these same questions come up when it comes to pricing a game (or other creation) but those questiosn are less clear cut because as a hobby, our pricing model is incredibly crude, so things may end up under or over priced for any number of reasons seperate from these 3, though <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> (I don't "deserve" to charge that much) is still pretty freaking destructive when it shows up.<br/><br/>All that in mind, here's the rub.  I, as a creator, am entitled to release my product for free, even for very bad reasons.  Frankly, if my reasons are bad, a certain amount of self correction is likely, and if my reasons are good, they will support me in this decision.  However, I must always be wary that my freedom to do so does not necessarily create an <b>expectation</b> on the part of my audience that they are <b>entitled</b> to my work for free or cheap, and folks who release things for free for reason <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> feed this expectation.  Similarly, as I promote the virtues of free product, the burden is on me (to my mind) that I am _not_ undercutting or condemming those who have chosen to charge a fair market rate for their material.  If I am not careful about that, everything else comes crumbling down.<br/><br/>In the end, I dont' think anyoen objects to free games being out there, I think they're (reasonably) concerned about games that are free or cheap for bad reasons, or any thinking that results in free being taken for granted rather than recognized as an exception.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

Speaking as one of those visual designer guys, I'd totally be down with that if I could navigate the 1km1kt site itself. :P<br/><br/>Actually, that's how I got started doing design for game designers. I offered Greg Stolze an unsolicited PDF of a board game he posted to the Unknown Armies mailing list. I then pressured him to finish Meatbot Massacre, which I also layed out for free.

                            Actually I think that Mark's point doesn't hold water. I do run free RPGs at cons and such. I haven't sold an RPG at GenCon in quite a while, yet there I am playing games every time. It's a hobby, you know, a fun one, and I do it not for the money, but for the fun of it. I was there before I ever made any money, and whether or not I am making money off RPGs in the future will have no bearing at all on whether I run RPGs. <br/><br/>Why, then, do I think that charging money is important? Simply because that's how the system works. Yes, I posit that if Rob and Fred had been charging for FATE all this time that it would be played far, far more than it is now. Oh, and BTW, there is an edition of FUDGE that you can pay for, which is a large part of what has made "Grey Ghost Press" and FUDGE as durable as it is. <br/><br/>It's non-sensical, but it's that "perception of value" thing. If you aren't charging for it, most people's minds argue to them, then it can't be worth anything. If it's got a pricetag on it, then somebody must have invested in putting it out there, and it must have been worth investing in (even if this isn't true). <br/><br/>It's silly, but it's true. If you have the guts to tell somebody that they're only going to be able to see your game if they give you some of their hard earned cash, then they're far more likely to play your game. <br/><br/>Oh, sure, lots of folks will download a free game, and some will even read it. But it's actually getting them to play that's important. And people won't do that, unless there's the sort of buzz about a game that you only see once it's being sold. <br/><br/>The fact that you're making money is, perhaps, ancillary to the real reason to charge for your game. And that's in order to inform people that it's worthwhile to play.<br/><br/>The real absurdity is how cheap RPGs are. Compare them with any other hobby. Any other hobby. Compare the cost to play vs hours of fun ratio. RPGs rate right down with lint collecting for cheap entertainment. Your cable TV probably costs more (unless you're an RPG collector, and don't buy games just to play them). So the idea that these costs are barriers to anyone playing these games is absurd. Oh, maybe if you live in Albania...<br/><br/>Mike                        </div>

I'd be very interested in hearing Jennifer's responses as well, actually, since I offered her exactly such a commission a couple months ago (I believe she was too busy with Dictionary of Mu to respond).<br/><br/>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe anybody in this thread is saying "vegetables are worth paying for, art is not."

                            One thing speaking in favor of charging money from products is also the fact that if people learn to get (all) stuff for free, it'll become a habit that's very hard to unlearn. It's quite hard to charge money from anything if customers are used to getting stuff for free or paying just enough to cover the writers/organisers expenses, and nothing else - that's pure hobby and not an industry. Those who do release products and charge (very reasonable) prices for them are somewhat are under tight scrutiny. If someone would, g-d forbid, organise a larp with profit in mind and be all open about it, the fallout would be harsh, no matter how good the event would be. That's the damnation of hobby-only enviroment.<br/><br/>The ransom-model seems to be working well by combining income and free content (though one has to have made a name to accomplish that) and I'd be delighted to see more stripped down free-versions of game and more polished commercial versions. More or less stand-alone free supplemental material would also be cool and draw in customers.                        </div>

I have to take issue here, Mike.  If free product isn't worth consideration, why is my webhost--why is virtually <i>every</i> colo webhost--running Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP instead of XP, IIS, SQL Server and ASP?<br/><br/>Yes, most large-scale OSS projects have licensed or support-fee-based versions, but Dreamhost doesn't pay for any of them.  And no, the software world is not a perfect analog for the RPG world, but your argument is exactly the one deployed against most large OSS projects right up until IBM started making those Linux commercials.                        </div>

                            Mike, you're not disagreeing with me. I'm not talking about the $$$ cost of participation being the barrier to entry. Let's face it, a group can play with one $0-$50 book and a few other incidentals. I'm talking about the only kind of costs that matter in an information economy (which is what gaming publishing is swiftly becoming): search costs. When there are 1,000 free RPGs, each existing as an intersection of orally-transmitted culture and shifting hand-me-down texts passed from gamer to gamer through informal networks... how does anyone ever discover quality? How do you find other people right here in your town who are playing the game you want to be playing? Exchange value, market value, is a signaling mechanism. It tells me what other people are willing to pay money for. It points me at the kewlness.<br/><br/>Without that, you have reputation economies. Reputation economies are wonderful things, but they fundamentally only work when you have large amounts of social capital to invest in them. Indeed, "indie" scenes start to fail (as art-creation environments) when they become more about Who You Know than What You Do. I think the indie gaming movement is teetering right on the edge of one of those critical moments. It can turn in on itself and become self-referential and clique/rockstar driven, accessible only to those "in the know." It can "sell out" and become commercially successful, but probably lose the open-ness and mutualism that have characterized it as an artistic movement. Or it can thread the needle - and really change the gaming culture.<br/><br/>This is like, so intimately tied into the Kerfuffle and Ben's social context posts. What I see Jonathan talking about is one possible social context for game design. I don't think it's new - it's the original. It's the cargo cult all over again. This isn't an automatic negative! There is a reason that model is so strong and beloved. But it's not revolutionary. The really revolutionary model would be to build something that's as broadly successful and accessible as possible but based around a different paradigm of What Gaming Is and How It Is Done.                        </div>

                            This is quickly drifting towards a new topic, "What Indie Roleplaying is Becoming," which I may try to start soon.<br/><br/><b>Ian:</b> Yes, exactly. I dig your gardening-farming metaphor.<br/><br/><b>Rob:</b> I think you're missing at least one reason why games might be released for free (if not more). What if you just like the feeling of giving it away and can afford to do so?  That doesn't seem philosophical (because you don't always have to do it) or pragmatic (because you're not trying to hook people so they'll buy stuff later).  Maybe you just do it for the fame and glory or because you like creating stuff. I can sit out on my front porch and play the banjo for people passing buy, no problem. Also, I think you're overly worried about free games devaluing roleplaying in general or causing people to expect things for free. This is not The Revolution. Commercial games will not be taken out back and shot. Professional game designers and freelance artists will not be forced to beg for crumbs of bread (well, not more than they already do).<br/><br/><b>Daniel:</b> Right on. That's how I recruited people to work on <i>Push</i>, just by telling them that they were awesome (which is true) and that they should write something awesome (which they did).  It's neat how that works.<br/><br/><b>Mike:</b> Yeah, I get it. You think we should sell things because it gives those things value.  Well, I'm interested in giving things value for other reasons as well.  I think there are plenty.  They man be non-traditional reasons (or, as Mark suggests, super-traditional) but I think they might still work.<br/><br/><b>Jukka:</b> I'm totally sympathetic to that problem. Existing expectations and trends can be a royal pain to change, no matter what they are, which is probably why a diversity of approaches is healthiest in the long run. Also, I was talking to Ben last night, who said he was disappointed to learn how small the Nordic larp scene actually is, relatively speaking, which leads to familiarity and close bonds, but also incestuousness and limited thinking in ways us Yanks might not expect (I'm just communicating my interpretation of what Ben said; no clue on the actual facts).  Sometimes I think the indie community is constantly in danger of something similar happening (I groan a bit every time I see a new "guns/swords and hard choices" game, before jumping in to play it) but then new designers come in and knock stuff out of the park.  Is there a way for a community to contine to be open to potentially radical change?  I hope so, but I'm not sure.<br/><br/><b>Mark:</b> Now that I know what you mean, I totally agree 95%. But I hope we can find ways of communicating "what games are the kewl kewlness" without using sales and word-of-mouth as the only factors. You're right that what I'm talking about here is more a return to our roots (imagined roots or actual roots, who knows?), which is probably not a long-term solution, but could be a sort of revitalization. Yay for those approaching different paradigms, whatever they will be.  I started <i>Push</i> specifically to go look for them and I can't wait to see what they are or to watch us build them together.  (Speaking of, dude, you should totally write something for <i>Push</i>; especially something talking about how crack-headed and wrong my whole approach is.)                        </div>

Actually, I agree with Ben a lot, here. The Nordic larp/immersive play community is a tight circle (or, to be more accurate, a number of tight circles in different countries, which these days overlap) of players who share a lot of history, a similar approach to roleplaying and similar goals/rewards for doing it. The circle is relatively small in numbers (somewhere from 100 to 500 people in Finland, I'd guess) and it's not's really growing. It does have a lot of weight, so to speak; this circle has a lot of people in their 30's and makes up a really large portion of folks who have been active in roleplaying scene for past five to ten years. It is a very limited in way of thinking (there is one main way of playing; other's are recognised but not actively pursued) and very inbred (it's a social network, not exactly invite only, but very close to it).<br/><br/>What I disagree with (I think; I'm really putting words to mouth here) is how it's a good thing. It's a good thing because it is, in essence, a very tight social contract which enforces one way of playing that's build upon mutual trust. I think Eero once said that we have "painted ourselves to corner", which is a very accurate way of putting it. But it's the best corner in the house and we're not really intrested in exploring the other ones.<br/><br/>I'm derailing here and will start another thread that will, hopefully, at some point return to this topic.                        </div>

<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>I'm talking about the only kind of costs that matter in an information economy (which is what gaming publishing is swiftly becoming): search costs. When there are 1,000 free RPGs, each existing as an intersection of orally-transmitted culture and shifting hand-me-down texts passed from gamer to gamer through informal networks... how does anyone ever discover quality? How do you find other people right here in your town who are playing the game you want to be playing? Exchange value, market value, is a signaling mechanism. It tells me what other people are willing to pay money for. It points me at the kewlness.<br/></blockquote>
No, this isn't true. The market price (<em>not</em> value) tells you where an upward sloping supply curve meets a downward sloping demand curve, and that's it. If there are thirty idiots are willing to pay $100 for the Big Fat Book of Garbage, but to get to a thousand buyers the price needs to be cut to $2, then the market price will be $100, and not $2, because that's the profit-maximizing price. But a price is not remotely the "true value" of the good; that's simply not the information market prices reveal. If you decide to pretend the price is the value anyway, well, that's you engaging in commodity fetishism right there, and that's <em>your</em> fault, not "the system's". Moreover, you already know all this -- if I asked you if Ptolus ($119) is 8.5 times as much fun as Dogs in the Vineyard ($14), you'd think I was making a joke, because it's too ludicrous an idea to take seriously.<br/><br/>The way you find genuine quality is exactly the way you find quality now, by playing games, talking to people, posting on bulletin boards, wikis, and weblogs, searching the Net, writing and reading reviews, showing novices how to play, and all the other real work of creating and maintaining a culture. The Internet has made this a lot easier to do than ever been before, too.<br/><br/>EDIT: I should add that there's nothing particularly wrong with selling games for profit. Just don't expect me to take seriously any argument that it's particularly right, or that it's wrong but mandated by The Man.                        </div>

                            In fairness, I consider philosophical to be a pretty wide umbrella, incorporating pursuit of happiness, desire for attention and many other things under it, but for the sake of clarity, let me lump all of <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> under the following umbrella - reasons which recognize that the product has commercial value, but which choose to (for whatever reason) pursue some _other_ value.  <br/><br/>But that's kind of a fiddly bit.<br/><br/>The real danger is the same one that is faced by, say, anyone dealing with Linux proponents (to stereotype grossly).  Many people find virtue in free distribution without stopping to think of what that might imply for the less virtuous.  Whether they mean it or not, they can easily create an environment where the commercial feel that their reasonable concerns are held against them.  Even when lip service is given to commercialization, as in the form of gross exaggerations, that very overcompensation can underscore the problems with the environment.<br/><br/>Is this such an environment? Nah.  If it got there, Luke would shiv someoen and take their wallet. But it's gotten close enough that it's maybe made some people uncomfortable, which seems the important yardstick.<br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            I disagree with Rob that a creator deciding their creation is worth nothing and therefore giving it away is "poison".

That may be a realistic assessment of the commercial prospects of the work, not its quality.<br/>
<br/>
I'm writing a d20 Modern supplement based on the works of O. Henry. Could I sell it? Maybe, I might stick it on a PDF and hock it for a few bucks, or set up a PayPal "donate here if you liked it", but the audience is so miniscule that although I'm absolutely devoted to the idea, I recognize that commercially, its value is 0 or so close to 0 that any investment of time I make in putting it in saleable form is going to be greater than the payoff of the money I might receive.  Other than The Gift of the Magi, who has read any O. Henry? And who read it and thought "damn, this would make a great game..."<br/>
<br/>
Now I might get midway through it and re-evaluate or my website might get a million hits in the first week and I might have to re-evaluate, but that's all it is, re-evaluation of commercial prospects, it has nothing to do with the quality of the piece.                        </div>

I think the "poison" effect Rob's talking about is what happens when you think you've been realistic about the commercial prospects of the work, and you're wrong, thereby transforming your work of commercial quality that you've incorrectly identified as having no commercial quality into an example of what people can get for nothing, so why should they bother with paying for other works of commercial quality.                        </div>

<p>Mike, please feel free to run with Synthesis under a different license, if you like. I would ask the courtesy of credit for my part of the design work, but if what's holding you back is the CC-like license on it (heck, I don't even remember the license, nor do I think it's actually <em>in</em> the text), I'm totally happy to give the baby to you for further work. I do think it's pretty cool, but where it presently is at is not my flavour anymore, and I wouldn't want to feel like I was keeping it moribund by my hippy ideals. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/></p>

                            Hey, guys! I'm seriously not going to have the time to write a serious response to this thread any time soon and I'm sorry. A deadline is calling me!<br/>
<br/>
If you're not against the concept of commercial art, then we don't have a problem. The manifesto image, including the phrase "Art has to be cheap and available to everyone," just leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I can recognize that the manifesto is not necessarily an attack on me or how I choose to live my life, but it can be read that way. I have dealt with alot of prejudice in the art world due to similar ideals and it's probably just a knee-jerk reaction.<br/>
<br/>
Jeez. I have alot to say, but I lack the ability and time to say it properly. I honestly think the best thing for me to do might be starting a new thread about freelance art, but not now. If anyone is interested in having these kinds of discussions, feel free to let me know privately and we can think about starting some shit.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry for starting a train of thought and not finishing it off, all. I hope that we can all talk about this again soon. It's important and interesting to me.<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Jenn!                        </div>

                            I don't accept at all either that it happens (commercial gaming and commercial art still exists even after Teh Intarweb, which was supposed to destroy both - I was there for the "Free Gaming Will Destroy The Industry" fights) or that it poisons the rest of the populace. Period.  You create what you want to create and you make an evaluation about its commercial viability. So does everyone else. If for some people that evaluation is that people would likely be willing to pay $0 or less than it would be worth to go through the sales-arranging process, and for others the evaluation is that people would likely be willing to pay $100 for it, nobody has poisoned anyone else. One evaluation may be mistaken, both may be mistaken, or neither may be mistaken.                        </div>

                            Yeah, let's see if we can not fight over this.  Unless people have something to say that's not really been gone over yet, why don't we let this thread sit for a while why we ponder the opinions and ideas that have been thrown own.  You can always start new threads if you need to get something off your chest.<br/><br/><b>Jennifer:</b> Thanks for the clarification.  The Cheap Art Manifesto is totally a reaction to, say, people feeling like they have to pay $5000 to own a piece of "real art," not freelance illustrators trying to make a living doing what they love. People who don't value the work you folks do or want to pay you crappily are fools.  On that note, though, I'd love to see a thread about your experience being a freelance artist for all these indie games and other projects that you've done recently.  That would be hot.                        </div>

                            I have time and money that I am more than willing to dedicate towards playing games and writing about how it went.  I've been doing it for years, it is without a doubt a hobby and one I enjoy.<br/><br/>I have time and money I am more than willing to dedicate towards putting out a podcast with Jeff.<br/><br/>However, the time and effort it takes to produce a game or even a supplement for a game is just too much to do without some kind of chance or hope of a cash reward at the end of the rainbow.  It is too much effort and too much time and too much heart and too much soul for me to put out there and not make money off of the endeavor, even if it is just so that in the end, the endeavor pays for itself and a little left over.                        </div>

                            No, JB, I agreed to that license idea, and I'm sticking to it. Why? Because, despite the fact that Jonathan would like to paint my points about practicality as me being The Man here, I'm actually on board with the notion that free is the way it should be. In case Jonathan ever does have a revolution, and it all starts to work, then that'll be my small contribution. <br/><br/>Neel, you can scoff all you want. I wasn't giving some theory about what gets games played, but my own annecdotal evidence about what happens when you publish for free. And, while I don't have hard numbers to back it up, my general experience that the situation is how it is overall. That's not an endorsement, but an assessment. If you can change it, then tell me how, and I'll be right behind you. <br/><br/>I want to give away my games, I've just found it more effective not to do so. <br/><br/>Mike                        </div>
