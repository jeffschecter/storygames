I'm still tweaking things a bit, but so far it has three games. <br/><br/>The House of Unusual Size began as an entry for the 2013 Harder Than Granite 24-Hour RPG Competition.  Characters find themselves trapped in an a mansion made of an infinite number of shifting rooms and must piece together their identities and their connection to the house as they struggle to escape.  The role of GM shifts from one scene to the next.<br/><br/>Red Rock is a more traditional roleplaying game focusing on a group of survivors who've found refuge in an abandoned industrial town.  The characters have no real knowledge of the apocalypse and only fragmentary glimpses of their lives before they arrived in town.  Their memories motivate them as they work to build a community and begin exploring the world.<br/><br/>Pine Grove is a story game where players create the history and features of a small town.  Each round a player rolls to see which aspect she'll describe and the other players build on her description.<br/><br/>Hopefully you'll like them.<br/><br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
