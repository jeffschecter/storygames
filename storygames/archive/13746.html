This particular game was released in a quick-play version several,months ago that has been in the retail channel for a while, but the full version of the game is months late. It's been pretty frustrating as a retailer to watch people bail on reorders because of MWPs dropping the ball on this one. Smallville had availability issues for a little while as well. We'd really love it if MWP came on board with BnM, anyone who speaks to them pleas let them know you'd buy it locally if they weren't offering us an inferior product to the one they sell directly!<br/><br/>That said, I am looking forward to FINALLY having it, if only because of how meta it is to stock an RPG licensed from a TV show that the head writer happily admits is based on his DnD games.<br/><br/>-Jim C (retailer by day)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311313">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks" title="CamBanks"><img alt="CamBanks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CamBanks">CamBanks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311313/#Comment_311313" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-05T23:12:42+00:00" title="February  5, 2011 11:12PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jim, we'd be happy to add you to our Preferred Retailer program.

Offlist email sent to inquire further about your PDF program.<br/><br/>Everyone else, please let folks know that it's not retailers being stupid, it's logistics, due to MWP shipping direct orders before the channel! We'll have the book in stock in a matter of days if it's gone out to distribution (there's typically a 1-2 week transit time depending on who your FLGS is using and where pubs are shipping from.) Don't let this one experience deter you from buying locally, if you have that option, please.<br/><br/>-JC                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
