I know you're generally down on all that "PC sensitivity crap" from discussions on Knife Fight, but I also know from past experience that you're really bothered by some aspects of cultural appropriation or writing about stuff you don't know.  Or that, at least, you don't want Yanks writing about London and therefore are worried about writing about the American South.<br/><br/>In general, I think what really matters is whether you have anything interesting to say about your chosen subject or not.  Like, if it's Legend of the 5 Rings or whatever, does it have anything interesting to say about the weird pseudo-Japanese society it gives us?  I'm not convinced, but maybe there's something there I'm not seeing.  Does The Mountain Witch have something more significant to say about trust or honor or the Samurai genre?  I think it has more to say, personally, but that's obviously subjective.<br/><br/>You know, scratch that... In a good game, I think, the players should be able to see what you're trying to say and then be able to accept or reject it on their own, because in roleplaying you basically raise questions instead of dictating the answers.  Does Dogs tell you how to feel about religion and power and Mormonism and polygamy and the like?  Not really, but it raises those questions and allows you to answer them.  So forget "saying something," I think, the real thing that makes a good game is if you can raise any interesting questions about something.  If you can't or are raising questions that aren't as interesting or are raised poorly or whatever, it's gonna be less exciting.  And, generally speaking, you need to know SOMETHING about a culture or place or time period to raise interesting questions about it, but you don't necessarily need to be a native or an expert.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269047">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269047/#Comment_269047" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T17:32:56+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  5:32PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 26, 2010 5:35PM by lordgoon.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>spending your time on those instead of the charms and stories of your home seems like a pretty big insult to your home.</blockquote>\nWhat if your home is an objectively boring, repressive and/or culturally impoverished hellhole, though?

I've driven around there once. Whatever I write, it's doomed to be a pastiche, based on half-remembered films. <br/><br/>It becomes slightly better if I do some reading first. If, for example, I read everything by Tennessee Williams, I <i>start</i> to be allowed to write about that area. Sure, I still don't know the location, but I'm giving my take on Tennessee Williams. Similarly, if you've read lots of Sherlock Holmes stuff, you're probably qualified to write a Holmes game.<br/><br/>Also, if I'm writing about a stylised version of a place, that's OK.

I live in Pittsburgh, and if you ask most folks living here, it's right up there with Fish Guts, Alaska. Sure, the people living in Fish Guts, Alaska may not find much of interest there, but I'll bet if you could find out what the Yupik think of it, you'd hear a different story. I've heard plenty of commentators refer to ANWR as a mosquito-infested hellhole. The Gwich'in name for the place I understand translates to something like, "the sacred source of all life." In short, I do not know of any objectively boring, repressive, and/or culturally impoverished hellhole on the face of the earth, and I gravely doubt that one exists.<br/><br/>Also, what Joe said.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/YunusWesley" title="YunusWesley"><img alt="YunusWesley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://webdrive.service.emory.edu/users/ywesley/cslogo.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/YunusWesley">YunusWesley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269059/#Comment_269059" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T18:01:24+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  6:01PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tying this back to the Southern Gothic thread, one of the biggest modern musical voices of Southern Gothic is Nick Cave. Dude's an Aussie. But he assimilated the mythology of SG and has made it work in performance, album after album: murders, revenge, ghosts, convicts and executions, religious conversions, oppression by religion and salvation through it, in both psychological and life-after-death senses. <br/><br/>Write what you know, but write what excites you too. Some of my very favorite books are the Aubrey/Maturin novels of Patrick O'Brian. They're historical fiction, and while the main characters are an Englishman and an Irish-Catalan Francophile (the nationalities of O'Brian's upbringing and of his somewhat wandering adult identity formation), the intense living quality of the series comes from insane research and reading of novels, letters, and archives of the Napoleonic period. That, and a living knowledge of sailing ships. <br/><br/>The problems of the historical novel and of the speculative novel are just the problems of any fictional writing amplified. The world is multifarious and detailed; whole populations with different historical memories, values, and marks of identity live right on top of each other, in London as well as Atlanta, Jerusalem, Kashmir, and any number of highly ordinary places. Portraying a world that seems real and interesting is hard no matter what milieu you select, and I am pretty sure that a portrayal of any place is going to ring false to some people familiar with it, no matter what.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L" title="Todd_L"><img alt="Todd_L" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fastfancydress.co.uk/templates/imagedirectory/50x50%5Chorse%20t.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Todd_L">Todd_L</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269062/#Comment_269062" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-26T18:50:40+00:00" title="April 26, 2010  6:50PM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 27, 2010 3:07AM by Todd_L.">edited April 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>a pastiche, based on half-remembered films</blockquote>\nBut why is that bad?<br/><br/>The things you notice, the things you remember, and what you choose to do with them-- <br/>will depend on who you are.

Sometimes you can't spend any time there, because it doesn't exist any more. You should still know it well. That's what I think.<br/><br/>I think <i>How We Came To Live Here</i> does a great job of incorporating and evoking the pre-Columbian American southwest without stepping all over it.

The feedback I've gotten from Poles has been largely positive, including praise from regular gamers and a curator at the Warsaw Uprising Museum. I've had two guys tell me I'm not qualified to write a game about the Rising, but honestly I don't think they read it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269101">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wburdick" title="wburdick"><img alt="wburdick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wburdick">wburdick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269101/#Comment_269101" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T05:14:25+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  5:14AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Should we write games based in places we don't know well?</blockquote>\nYou should know the place you are writing about well, but you can know a place well without spending any time there.

However people shouldn't feel obligated to write games about places they aren't familiar with. Just because most contemporary horror games take place in America, that doesn't mean you shouldn't write one set in the UK, or rural France or Zimbabwe for that matter.

It was actually Graham suggesting that placing the game in the town you're playing in was boring which got me to change the rule. Now the rule is that you either play somewhere that everyone knows extremely well, or someplace no one has ever been to. I feel that works pretty well.<br/><br/>My favorite scenario to run for Blowback is in post-Katrina New Orleans. Now, I've been to New Orleans three or four times, but not since Katrina. The scenario I run is about the warring factions of people who want to preserve New Orleans' history, and the people who want to get rid of all the poor people and dilapidated housing, and turn it into a Disneyfied version of itself. I have zero firsthand knowledge of that; I only know what I've read and seen on television. But the scenario works well and no one has told me it seemed unrealistic or unfair to the survivors of Katrina. And for a while, I actually considered making New Orleans the canonical setting of Blowback; I changed my mind because the book will be long enough as it is.<br/><br/>I think the crux is in what you're trying to emulate. If your goal is to emulate the exploration of a location, then you need to know that location well; if you're trying to emulate a type of fiction, you have to know that fiction well; if you're not trying to emulate anything, who cares? It's like saying you can't write science fiction unless you're an honest-to-God scientist.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269110/#Comment_269110" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-27T06:13:43+00:00" title="April 27, 2010  6:13AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The only time it matters is when it is in your hometown and they get something wrong and the people playing give a shit.

I have a blind, unthinking hatred for Cleveland, as any good Yinzer does. But I know there's a lot to love there, nonetheless, and if I lived there, I'd probably love it, too. I've listened to hundreds of people tell me about the "gruesome shitholes" of the world, only to find out that if they dug a little bit, they'd find a thousand wonderful things about it. I love the place where I live, but I hear people describe it as a "shithole" every day. In my experience, the difference between a "gruesome shithole" and a place you love is how much time you've spent to get to know it.<br/><br/>That has nothing whatsoever to do with terrible things happening. But if you love a place, you love it even when terrible things happen there. Even more importantly, you're more likely to <em>do something about it</em> when something terrible does happen there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Should I write games set in the American South?

Most people can talk about books they haven't read because some of them permeate popular culture.  I've not read any Harry Potter but I am well enough informed to describe themes and characters present and to offer a critique of those books based on others' writings.  Whilst this may smack of loose relativism there is a difficulty in finding an expert position on almost anything.  I mean, who is an expert?<br/><br/>I think that people can find 'London' or 'The South' evocative places and that evocation can lead to something creative.  If an American wants to write something set in London that's fine.  I think the problem comes if they state that their version is a definitive reality.  It is merely transreal, just as any version of the American South I create is.  They could even create a reality where Millwall and West Ham fans are the greatest of friends.

What about a period of history? If this logic is taken to it's extreme, my gaming would be pretty boring, probably not even as much fun as Papers &amp; Paychecks...<br/><br/>I think it all takes perspective, research, and honesty of presentation.<br/><br/>And getting back to Graham's question at the end of the original post:<br/><br/>I set my limits. I have long been interested in various games with Asian settings. I have yet to run any of them. I just feel woefully under equipped to do them justice. I've hardly even been exposed to much fiction, whether it be remotely good or just horrible depiction of actual Asian culture/history. I do best when the game is set in a non-historical setting that is grounded in pseudo-European culture (not that I really know anything about historical European culture). I've had fun with a variety of settings, but I know that I bring my own cultural biases to them. Most of the time it's fun, and if I stick with non-historical settings, at least I'm not directly doing injustice to real places, people, and history.<br/><br/>In the end, if you feel good about what you're doing, do it. If you think you should check just one more time with a bit more research, actually visiting the place, or talking to someone who has been there, do it. If you feel you have done the best job you can do, and you think it's worthy of sharing, do so. If a setting grabs you and speaks to you, and you have something to say about that and share about that, do so, whether it be publishing a game, sharing a game with a few close friends, GMing a game, or just playing in a game, or even just reading a game because you are interested in the subject matter of that game.<br/><br/>Frank                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269538">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers" title="Simon_Rogers"><img alt="Simon_Rogers" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_Rogers">Simon_Rogers</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269538/#Comment_269538" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-04-30T03:13:59+00:00" title="April 30, 2010  3:13AM">April 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We played a game of PTA called Outback! set in the Australian outback the 1880s.

By using an alternate reality you can take the elements of that setting that intrigue you but put them somewhere where you can happily fill gaps and make mistakes.

And sometimes this approach is better, because removed of the need for authenticity you can use those discredited cliches or myths as real. it's easier on the players too, who don't want to be experts in the obscure details of a setting. I can play Dogs in the Vineyard without worrying that my entire understanding of Mormons or the American Frontier comes from a few shows on the Discovery channel.<br><br>Hell, the guys behind in the new Star Trek franchise pulled a similar stunt to avoid the 'canon' of the established Star Trek universe, Mongoose took 2nd Age Glorantha to avoid all the canon on the 3rd age etc. So it works in genre as much as out of it.<br/><br/>So if something about the American South captures your imagination, I would see if you cannot port that a 'fictional' setting based off whatever cliches or myths you want to exploit.

How much do you have to read before you're allowed to write about a place, and how much are you allowed to write per page read? How valid is a public, international notion of a place, compared to a place as locals view it? How fictional is fictional \u2014\xa0if your characters aren't real people, then they presumably come with fictional apartments and houses and fictional relatives and fictional histories? Once you start telling a story set anywhere, you start lying a little bit, and you start getting things technically wrong. How much verisimilitude is necessary to offset what's fictional? Where do you find the truth that makes for realism, and how much of that is truth as opposed to accuracy?<br/><br/>I pose these as troublesome, vaguely snide questions, rather than answers, because I think fiction answers these questions, each in different ways, by having the gall to come into existence, for better or worse. <br/><br/>Or, alternately, sometimes a city is just a city \u2014\xa0sometimes a city is not a character but just a collection of tree flavors and weather selected to be the painted backdrop to a tale.

I can play Dogs in the Vineyard without worrying that my entire understanding of Mormons or the American Frontier comes from a few shows on the Discovery channel.<br/><br/>Hell, the guys behind in the new Star Trek franchise pulled a similar stunt to avoid the 'canon' of the established Star Trek universe, Mongoose took 2nd Age Glorantha to avoid all the canon on the 3rd age etc. So it works in genre as much as out of it.<br/><br/>So if something about the American South captures your imagination, I would see if you cannot port that a 'fictional' setting based off whatever cliches or myths you want to exploit. The same is true of someone outside London writing about London. And it might be better for it.</blockquote>\nI agree. When it's really really close to the real thing, then you can start thinking about just making it based more strictly on real world.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269724">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269724/#Comment_269724" name="Item_86" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T11:44:29+00:00" title="May  2, 2010 11:44AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite>Is Cleveland<i>really</i>as far as your mind can stretch when the topic is horrible places? Does the map on your wall just have a  big blank space where rural Afghanistan should be? Or semi-rural Louisiana, for that matter?</blockquote>\nUh, no. You talked about my "Fundamental, Deeply Spiritual (nay, Zenlike) Respect for all Places, Things, and Beings," and I just picked Cleveland as the first place that popped into my head that went against the condescending bullshit you're trying to pin on me.<br/><br/>So, let's talk about Afghanistan instead. I haven't been there. Maybe you have, but I have not. I've listened closely to people who've gone there, so if you have and you want to tell me about it, I'll listen closely to what you have to say about it, but it's still second-hand to me, and I've heard this kind of thing second-hand many times over\u2014once more in this very thread from Bill. People I talk to who have gone to Afghanistan often tell me that they will say to the locals, "This is an objectively repressive, culturally impoverished hellhole. Why don't you move to someplace better?" The response they get from the locals is first, "Fuck you, you pompous, first-world asshole," but once they calm down from being so blithely insulted, they might take the time to explain that this is their home. Their ancestors lived here when they made Alexander the Great turn back, they lived here when the Silk Road connected the Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire, they lived here when pompous European powers "played the Great Game," they lived here when they defeated the Soviet Union when the U.S. couldn't, and they're not going to abandon it now. Things are bad there right now, yeah, but that doesn't change the beauty of their home, it doesn't take the bones of their ancestors out of the soil, and it doesn't make them any less of that place. They say they belong to that place, and they could no more abandon it than they could abandon their family.<br/><br/>Which is what makes my head spin a bit when you call my stance insulting. Because generally, in my experience and in the experiences I've had recounted to me, I've heard no end of people who feel extremely insulted by the kind of things <em>you're</em> saying. I can't say I've really heard a lot of people who felt insulted when someone said that people might love the places where they live.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: ffilz</cite>A thought I have - if there's something wrong about someone writing about a place that they don't know intimately, is it any better to GM a game in a place one doesn't know intimately? What about a period of history? If this logic is taken to it's extreme, my gaming would be pretty boring, probably not even as much fun as Papers &amp; Paychecks...</blockquote>\nI don't know if I'd go as far as to say that it's <em>wrong</em> to write a game or a story set in some other place. Heck, I'm running a <em>Chronica Feudalis</em> game right now set in post-Roman Britain. But I think you might miss a lot of opportunities for a game or a story that can connect you more deeply to the place where you live. I'm also running a <em>Werewolf: The Forsaken</em> game right now set in Pittsburgh. It's been pretty awesome. In the last session, they got their pack totem: a thunderbird named Cursed Sky, the spirit of our so-often-gray skies. He accepted them only when they retrieved the nuke from <a href="http://pittsburgh.about.com/od/transportation/a/b25_bomber.htm" rel="nofollow">the B-25 that went down in the Monongahela near Bird's Landing</a>. In the one before that, they defeated a spirit of disease called the Gift Giver, who was born from <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1088/did-whites-ever-give-native-americans-blankets-infected-with-smallpox" rel="nofollow">that little incident with the smallpox-infected blankets</a>, which happened at Fort Pitt. In short, we've dealt with a lot of local issues, local folklore, local history, and local images, reflected through the "Spirit World" in the game so that we can mythologize it, and thus, deal with it on a different level.<br/><br/>We just ended a <em>Mouse Guard</em> campaign where I shifted the setting from Michigan to <a href="http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/cookforest.aspx" rel="nofollow">Cook Forest</a>. That campaign dealt with the environmental issues in the region: the effects of global warming, the extinction of wolves, the emergence of the eastern coyote, invasive species, and the legacy of past deforestation. Putting it all from an other-than-human perspective gave it a spin that made us really deal with the implications of these problems, rather than devolving into the inanity of a "Captain Planet" rip-off.<br/><br/>I've run these games with players who had the same opinion about our home as you imply that you have about yours. They said that nothing interesting happens in Pittsburgh, that there's nothing interesting here, that we should set the game some place interesting like New York or Los Angeles. My brother at least relented that Pittsburgh might fit <em>some</em> genres. "But you wouldn't want to run, say, a supers game here." I asked him why not. He came back a week later with no less than <em>three</em> concepts for a supers game, all of them really interesting, and not one of them would really work in anyplace <em>but</em> Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>Sure, we could have run <em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em> in Liberty City. It'd probably be a lot of fun. We'd kick some super-villain behind and leap tall buildings in a single bound. It'd be a fun night. But now, we get all that, <em>plus</em> something more. I got to see the impact of this a few weeks ago. I'm designing a game that really takes this idea to heart; it really starts with taking places that you know, and developing characters attached to those places. In one game that my brother played in, he played the Ferryman. Lots of stories circulate about the Point, where the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio meet (as well as <a href="http://www.clpgh.org/exhibit/neighborhoods/point/point_n77.html" rel="nofollow">the secret, underground fourth river</a>) as a potent entryway to the Underworld. This Ferryman would take pilgrims there. He lived in his wigwam, built amidst the ruins of Station Square. A few weeks ago, my brother told me he'd gone down there for something, and as he walked under an underpass there, it hit him, "Wow, this is where the Ferryman lives." It gave the place a story, and that story gave him a connection. Either way, we'll have a fun game. With a local game, we have the opportunity to have a fun game, plus something important and lasting when we're done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269727">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269727/#Comment_269727" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T12:12:54+00:00" title="May  2, 2010 12:12PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2010 12:17PM by Graham.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jason and Mark, both of you are making excellent points.

Sure, you can point to a lot of other things that bogged Alexander down, but Afghans I've heard from prefer to emphasize how hard they made it to take the country, so he couldn't focus on other things, <em>and that's why</em> all those other factors became issues. Much the same story with the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Is that an accurate picture of what really happened? Maybe, maybe not.

His example was, you're running from the bad guy, and you know the neighborhood better than he does as the GM, so you say, "OK, I duck into the police station on such-and-such street." The GM didn't know about that police station and hadn't planned for it, so it disrupts his plans. I tout this as one of the benefits of a locally-set game. Players might know parts better than I do, so they might throw in elements I wasn't even aware of. I might have the bad guy chasing them, and they duck into the police station on such-and-such street, which totally disrupts my plans!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269746/#Comment_269746" name="Item_94" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T15:51:57+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  3:51PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>Which is why I meant Freedom City, the default setting in<em>Mutants &amp; Masterminds</em>, but then I wrote Liberty City instead.</blockquote>\nComic book settings are really interesting even before we start getting into their extension, comic book RPG settings.  Suffice to say that one reason comic book settings are the way that they are is because artists have greater freedom to imagine what (say) Metropolis looks like than they do what New York City looks like.  Of course as time goes on, in heavy-continuity comic books, the visual identity of a comic book city becomes as pre-determined as a real city.  (Metropolis has a particular look/style that DC comics aficionados can identify, Gotham City is probably a more famous and distinctive (successful?) example.)  I would imagine that Freedom City's creation is meant to mirror that kind of comic book city's creation.  And I think it actually succeeds at that very well.  But it's an interesting topic.  Why is Spiderman in New York City and Starman in Opal City? What went into those decisions and how might we make similar decisions in our own comic book games?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269751">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jason" title="jason"><img alt="jason" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/741/nSSKWSOUO6KV7.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jason">jason</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269751/#Comment_269751" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T16:34:09+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  4:34PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Comic book settings are really interesting even before we start getting into their extension, comic book RPG settings.

As you point out, "Metropolis" and "Gotham" didn't "free" their writers from dealing with constraints, since over time, canon becomes as "restrictive" as reality. But I think that putting it in terms of how it "restricts" stories is kind of missing the point. When I read Marvel comics, the real-world setting seems like it opens more creative doors than it closes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Timothy" title="Timothy"><img alt="Timothy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Timothy">Timothy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269756/#Comment_269756" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T17:51:08+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  5:51PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 2, 2010 6:00PM by Timothy.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lordgoon</cite><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>spending your time on those instead of the charms and stories of your home seems like a pretty big insult to your home.</blockquote>\nWhat if your home is an objectively boring, repressive and/or culturally impoverished hellhole, though?

But if you pay all that money for it and spend the time to try to read such dense prose, you'll be rewarded with some amazing ideas. If you want to know where I got the cockamamie ideas which follow, you'll need to read chapter 8, "Ancestry, generation, substance, memory, land,"<br/><br/>Europeans recognize individuals, which we conceptualize in an essentially Cartesian dualism: body and soul if you're religious, or nature and nurture if you're not. So, we're very big into genealogy. After all, genealogy tells you where you came from, which tells you your nature. So, to Europeans, indigeneity is a matter of descent. If you are descended from indigenous people, you are indigenous. Then we get into a big, complicated dance of, "Well, how much indigenous ancestry do you need to count as indigenous? Is someone who is 1/64th Cherokee still Cherokee, or not?"<br/><br/>This has become very important to indigenous groups in the modern world. In an effort to find some kind of redress for past grievances, we now have laws which respect indigenous peoples, which makes it an important legal point to understand who is indigenous and who is not. You get all kinds of dishonest types who try to claim indigeneity for the legal rights. And from that perspective, I have no problem with the modern discussion about indigeneity. I am fiercely in favor of the rights of indigenous people.<br/><br/>However, as Ingold illustrates, this is a matter of these people working within a European construct to find some way for Europeans to recognize them. It has very little to do with any indigenous group's traditional view of itself.<br/><br/>And notice I said "traditional view." Most indigenous people have had traffic of one sort or another with European ideas for a very long time, and many of them have come to new views that incorporate European views. That doesn't have much bearing on the traditional views of their society, however.<br/><br/>Where Europeans focus on genealogy, indigenous traditions more often focus on experience. It has nothing to do with genealogy, and everything to do with your own dwelling in the landscape. Indigenous traditions, by and large, have little interest in genealogy. Yes, you'll often hear talk of "the ancestors," but they rarely go into the kind of detail that a genealogy provides, charting precisely who descended from who. In fact, if you really follow closely what they have to say about "the ancestors," you quickly realize that it has nothing to do with genealogy at all. They typically don't honor their ancestors because of their genealogical relationship, but because their ancestors' participation in the landscape created the landscape that they participate in today in so many real, concrete ways.<br/><br/>I've heard some indigenous people speak of "becoming native" as a continuing process, one that they never complete, but continue throughout their lives. I've heard others contrast the Biblical creation story as something that happened long ago, to their own understanding of creation as an ongoing process, and the work of humanity lies precisely in that ongoing work of creating the world. Both of these seem to reflect Ingold's point. From most native perspectives, you don't become native because of your birth; what you do makes you native or not.<br/><br/>Anyway, why do I even bother to go into this? What you said makes perfect sense from a European view, where indigeneity is a matter of heredity. You're not descended from indigenous people, and you never will be, so that's the end of that. By European standards, I'm not indigenous, either. Ingold suggests that we allow this Latinate word "indigenous" remain the word for this European concept, and we use "native" for this other, more, well, <em>native</em> understanding of it. I have no reason to argue with him. When you live in a particular place, its air flows through your blood, its water flows through your body, and its soil flows through your flesh and bones, and part of the point of that life, to me, seems to lie in how we try to become more native to the place that gives us life every day. From <em>that</em> perspective, your statement becomes very difficult to understand. Yes, the local geomythology has native roots, that would seem like the very reason <em>why</em> you'd engage it. If you don't have very strong native roots yourself, then that seems like an even <em>stronger</em> reason to engage it.\n<blockquote>b) Americans won't buy it.</blockquote>\nI live in America, and I'd buy it.

What you said makes perfect sense from a European view, where indigeneity is a matter of heredity. You're not descended from indigenous people, and you never will be, so that's the end of that. By European standards, I'm not indigenous, either. Ingold suggests that we allow this Latinate word "indigenous" remain the word for this European concept, and we use "native" for this other, more, well,<em>native</em>understanding of it. I have no reason to argue with him. When you live in a particular place, its air flows through your blood, its water flows through your body, and its soil flows through your flesh and bones, and part of the point of that life, to me, seems to lie in how we try to become more native to the place that gives us life every day. From<em>that</em>perspective, your statement becomes very difficult to understand. Yes, the local geomythology has native roots, that would seem like the very reason<em>why</em>you'd engage it. If you don't have very strong native roots yourself, then that seems like an even<em>stronger</em>reason to engage it.<br/></blockquote>\nWell, I have a couple of obvious answwers, and in giving them I don't wish to disagree with the power of what you have said, but let me give you my response:<br/><br/>* roleplaying games are, and I know I'm going to get really roasted for this, very combat-centric. I have no real desire for the player characters in my games to kill the spirit of the Nerang River and pinch its stuff.<br/><br/>* many of the local indigenous groups have religions which are mystery cults: to know is to be invested in their religion, and so the right to know or not to know, and to teach or not teach certain things is very important to them, and the non-mysterious way in which things are stated in gaming materials does the power of the ideas a disservice. The way a story is tolfd, and the right to tell that story, matter. The fact that I can find where the leaks in their cult have been and steal their gods for my own artistic needs doesn't make it a tasteful thing for me to do.<br/><br/>* many of the traditional custodians of places here have requested that images of their sacred places not be used for commercial gain. I could use the spirit who is physically embodied as Burleigh Head in roleplaying materials, sure, but there's no advantage to anyone in me doing this, when I can instead fool around with the folklore of Christianised European peoples, who no longer believe in the creatures I'm using.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269781/#Comment_269781" name="Item_102" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-03T00:16:17+00:00" title="May  3, 2010 12:16AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jason</cite>I think Marvel's decision to set their comics in real-world places has worked out to their benefit over time.

I won't take you to task for saying RPG's center on combat. I know exactly what you mean. Even games that try to not center on combat often do it by creating a system that handles all kinds of <em>conflict</em> (which they often call <em>conflict</em>), thus seeing <em>everything</em> as a particular <em>kind</em> of combat.<br/><br/>That said, when the players in my <em>Werewolf</em> game defeated the Gift Giver ... it felt a little bit like a kind of dramatized exorcism of some powerful local demons, in a weird and unique kind of way.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Timothy</cite>many of the local indigenous groups have religions which are mystery cults: to know is to be invested in their religion, and so the right to know or not to know, and to teach or not teach certain things is very important to them, and the non-mysterious way in which things are stated in gaming materials does the power of the ideas a disservice.

In fact, this really gets to one of the reasons I spend so much time preparing and designing and playing RPG's. I don't like the life the world's handed to me, but I can't take somebody else's life and call it my own, either. Cultural appropriation won't get you where I want to go. So what do you do? How do you regenerate your own oral tradition, for instance, instead of ripping off someone else's? The best answer I've found lies with some really good RPG's. You start playing with the images of the world around you, and see where you lead. I wouldn't advise trying to copy aboriginal stories. But look at the place you live in, think of what it feels like to live there.<br/><br/>On Saturday, I started a new D&amp;D 4E game (I wind up playing a lot of "trad" games, even though I prefer story games, simply because I can't muster up enough people who share my enthusiasm). I wanted to see how far I could take it, so I drew on the Fenian cycle of Irish mythology. According to family lore, we descend from Fionn mac Cumhail, so I threw in the images of my family myths. We played the first session on May Day, in which I inverted the story of Fionn coming to Tara on Samhain. Instead, they came to Myth Drannor during Greengrass, and instead of a fire goblin, they had an ice goblin to deal with. I know a lot of the Irish myths tell the story of the weather there, but this story really seemed to speak to our local weather. We can't really plant much here until mid-May, because we usually have one last cold snap in the first few days of May. As the PC's fought the ice goblin and his pet white dragon during Greengrass, it felt a lot like a kind of ritual to drive out the last frost of winter, so that summer could begin.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Well, I don't know.

I mean, my example here was <em>The Wire</em>, which has also been highly praised for how authentically it tapped into an essential Baltimore-ness, if you will. If we strive to stay true to the spirit of a place, does a darker Chicago really deviate from the objective reality (whatever that may mean) any more than two first-hand experiences of Chicago? The "truth" of any given place lies not in a single point, but in a whole range of perception. You don't need to give up on the reality of the place to lean one way or another in that perception.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269866">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269866/#Comment_269866" name="Item_111" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-03T20:08:46+00:00" title="May  3, 2010  8:08PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 3, 2010 8:10PM by AccountingForTaste.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Todd L</cite>Gotham is NYC.<br/><br/>You can say otherwise, but that doesn't make it true.<br/><br/>Chicago?!</blockquote>\nI think that was picked because they used Chicago as Gotham's stand-in in the last two movies.  It was an interesting choice, and squared up okay with the slightly-less-mythologized Batman stories they were telling.  A smaller, less atmospheric Batman universe can exist in a smaller, less atmospheric Gotham City.<br/><br/>Anyway, the usual quote I've heard is that "Gotham City is New York City at night; Metropolis is NYC during the day."

But only because I think it actually *is* relevant to the thread.<br/><br/>Like Accounting said - Gotham and Metropolis are versions (or "aspects") of New York, instead of merely being aliases. Metropolis is the NYC of the 1950s movie serials - skyscrapers and bustle and "canyons of steel", etc. While Gotham is the "dark side" of NYC - the crime and poverty and corruption that is endemic to any big city.<br/><br/>In terms of fiction, especially gaming or superhero or fantasy fiction, I prefer this to using the actual New York. Spiderman lives in the "real" New York, right? Except he doesn't, because the real New York has no superheroes. <br/><br/>So Spiderman and his existence can't really have any major effect on New York. Because as soon as that happened, the "real" city of the comics would diverge sharply from the actual real city. <br/><br/>Batman can change Gotham City, though, because he's part of the "real" Gotham City.<br/><br/>To tie this back to Graham's thread, I think we're <span style="text-decoration: underline;">always</span> playing in a fictionalized version of a city or a place in an RPG.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270358/#Comment_270358" name="Item_116" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T10:45:00+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 10:45AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well, yes, of course.<br/><br/>Could we take the fascinating discussions on comic book locations to new threads, so we can give them the attention they deserve?<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270371/#Comment_270371" name="Item_117" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-07T11:54:27+00:00" title="May  7, 2010 11:54AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry ..

To what extent does any story, regardless of medium, really deal with its setting? AS we've seen in this thread, no matter how faithfully you reproduce a real setting, you begin to diverge from the reality of the setting insofar as the fictional events of your story have now occurred in this now that-much-fictional place. As you said, Spider Man doesn't really inhabit New York City as we know it; he inhabits New-York-City-with-Spider-Man.<br/><br/>But, frankly, I think this kind of misses the point. After all, we want to talk about settings here, not histories, right? I like stories where the setting plays a very strong, active role; the kind where people will often say that "the setting really becomes one of the main characters." I like these stories <em>because of</em> my deep interest in the unique voice, mood, and, for lack of a better word, <em>spirit</em> that pervades a given place.<br/><br/>Correct me if I have this wrong, Graham, but I would guess that you do not respond the same way to all setting inaccuracies. I would guess that you really only get upset at the inaccuracies that violate your experience of that <em>spirit</em> of the place, when it just doesn't <em>feel</em> like that place? I can relate to that. Kevin Smith loves to film movies in Pittsburgh. Picking out the views I can recognize in <em>Dogma</em> really gives it a unique spin. But a terrible movie from several years ago titled <em>Stigmata</em> supposed takes place in Pittsburgh, but they filmed it in Toronto. It looks nothing like Pittsburgh. It feels nothing like Pittsburgh. The scene I usually highlight takes place on a subway. Pittsburgh has a T, and it does go underground for a few blocks downtown, but we don't have a subway system, at least, not like that. I got upset because it violated my sense of the spirit of Pittsburgh.<br/><br/>I don't mind Spider Man changing New York City. Spider Man's New York City doesn't have to have the same history as the real New York City, because I want a setting, not a history. I really only need Spider Man's New York City to remain true to the spirit of New York City.<br/><br/>To use anything fictional example that I think most here will know, <em>The Wire</em> focused completely on Baltimore. Baltimore played a bigger role in that series than any other character. They didn't shrink from changing Baltimore's history, though. They gave Baltimore a different mayoral history and different key politicians, and showed no qualms about changing even that. They had experiments with drug legalization, political shifts, and shake-ups in the police force that, in real life, would have had an enormous impact on the city's history. In the case of the incident that they based on a similar, real-life event, it <em>did</em> have an enormous impact on Baltimore. But most importantly, through five seasons, they remained true to the spirit of Baltimore. Nobody cared that much that the history diverged, or that they fictionalized some details. It still felt like Baltimore, because they kept true to that spirit.<br/><br/>So, bringing this back around to Graham's original question\u2014more importantly than how long you've lived in a place (or haven't), or how many details you know about it, how well do you understand the spirit of a place, and how well can you capture it?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270412">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270412/#Comment_270412" name="Item_120" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T00:20:38+00:00" title="May  8, 2010 12:20AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite>I accept that last part as true.

It'll be a pale pastiche of the South, as seen on The Dukes Of Hazzard and assorted films.<br/><br/>I've actually answered this question to my satisfaction. It's not so much about whether you've lived there as whether you've done your research.

Is M*A*S*H better or worse?<br/><br/><br/>Of course-- this does prove your point: if an individual can't tell whether a given piece of Southern media is legit/ that suggests they have no business producing Southern media themselves!<br/><br/>(Which reminds me of an old interview of Joseph Heller and Kurt Vonnegut where they discuss how Catch-22 is regarded as exaggerative; but they claim those who experienced US service WW2 know it's accurate.)\n<blockquote> I've actually answered this question to my satisfaction.</blockquote>\nThat's clear, but in this thread you've hardly engaged with anybody you didn't already agree with.<br/><br/>Which is a good way to conduct yourself, rather than trying to 'win'.<br/><br/>But part of the discussion that went ignored was along the lines of 'OK, you "shouldn't" [write games set in the South]... so... Why Not?"<br/><br/>The bad-pastiche answer is good. (And me quibbling about the Dukes of Hazzard doesn't refute your point.)<br/><br/>But there are other aspects to the question <i>"ok, why not then?"</i> that have been left hanging there.<br/>You're under no obligation to pursue those loose ends if you don't care to.<br/>But, to me at least, it feels like the question is 'answered to your satisfaction', yet much remains unanswered.<br/><br/>For me the big questions are 'where's the harm in it?' and 'is avoiding that harm worth the cost of self-censoring creativity?'<br/><br/>Throughout this thread I've been mindful of Heinlein's advice that knowing too much about a subject impedes one's ability to write gripping fiction about it.      Is that what it boils down to: knowing what your own Mission Statement is?  So that, if you want to write good fiction, you shouldn't let local reality get in the way.  And if you want to depict local reality, you should let it impede the storytelling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_270426">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270426/#Comment_270426" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-08T08:00:42+00:00" title="May  8, 2010  8:00AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><br/>No, because it won't be interesting.

I'm not sure I agree, in terms of an RPG - although I would be more inclined to agree if we were talking about, say, fiction - but I understand.<br/><br/><sup><b>Cooter footnote:</b> Speaking of Ben Jones, who played Cooter on the Dukes of Hazzard - not only did he go on to represent Georgia as a Congressman for a couple terms, he was eventually defeated by none other than Newt Gingrich, back when ol' Newt was an unknown challenger. He opened a Dukes of Hazzard museum and BBQ joint in Sperryville VA (which later closed down). I interviewed him when it opened, back when I was a newspaper reporter. He was super nice, and told me that the show smashed up the General Lee so often that they employed two people full-time to travel around the country buying up old '69 Dodge Chargers.</sup> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_270478">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Upstart" title="Upstart"><img alt="Upstart" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/303/n8GYZQSU6A1IL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Upstart">Upstart</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/270478/#Comment_270478" name="Item_123" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-09T01:49:09+00:00" title="May  9, 2010  1:49AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite><cite>Posted By: Brian Minter</cite>I accept that last part as true.
