A guy walked up to the Story Games open play table, and picked up InSpectres and said something like, "I used to play D&amp;D, and read about this game 10 years ago, and have been wanting to play it ever since." He lit up when I said, "Ok, want to play it now?" We had a good time, and despite some initial nervousness on his part, he did as well. I hope he looks around the internet for games &amp; community, now.<br/><br/>I also played <b>Silver &amp; White</b>, despite Jackson's reservations, and had a blast. I got genuine chills during that game--suprise and fear, and that's never happened for me in a roleplaying/story game before. I'd never played with the crew (Orion, Tori, someone else I can't remember her name), but we meshed quickly and what came of it was special.<br/><br/>The only other game I played was <b>My Daughter, the Queen of France</b>, though I had to leave early and didn't get the full experience. It worked OK in a crowded con setting, and we had one "new to story games" player, though she didn't mesh as well, since we were all going monotone in scenes (per the rules) and she couldn't quite bring herself to restrain her emotion. I had more fun playing other people's characters in scenes rather than my own, but chalk that up to only playing like 4 scenes. Let's play this before the year is out, Harry.<br/><br/>And that's all I played! Brenda and I went to a few panels, and they ranged from mediocre (geek culture, feminism, and race) to great (Ink-Stained Amazons). It was sort of a unique con experience for me, as it was my first non-gaming centric con, and it was my wife's first con in general. She was a bit overwhelmed at first, and Saturday was kinda difficult for her, but Sunday was a blast, and she stepped up and had a great time with InSpectres.<br/><br/>I picked up some fun art, as well:<br/><br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/Spock.jpg"/><br/><br/><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://i228.photobucket.com/albums/ee1/NotHans/Eowyn.jpg"/><br/><br/>And oh!

There were some rough edges with scheduling and tables, but the con still had the good vibes. Sunday was even better. Everyone was holding their breath Saturday and it was way more relaxed Sunday. <br/><br/>We probably could sell Story Games at it next time. I know that Joel had a sign up, but I don't know if he ever pitched Dreaming Crucible. I feel like there would have been a good feedback loop if we did have some on hand to sell:<br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Hmmm... look at these games I can buy. I'd like to try them first  --&gt;<br/><br/>I just played a fun new game and it was easy to learn. I wish I could buy it.</b><br/><br/><br/><br/>Tori made some great flyers with the URL's for the meetup sites in Seattle, Olympia and Portland and we handed out a ton of them. I had a few Fabricated Realities posters up. It was a good time and we had a large presence in the gaming room (we were always overflowing our one table).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345560/#Comment_345560" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-11T10:07:56+00:00" title="October 11, 2011 10:07AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I chose to attend a bunch of awesome panels instead of playing games, but the con itself was awesome.

I spent it mostly just kicking it with the Northwest Story Games crew in the gaming room.  However, my girlfriend attended panels in every single time slot and she made a very keen and I think important observation.  She said the whole thing felt less like a convention and more like a conference.  The difference being that a convention is a celebratory environment while a conference is about sharing and promoting actionable ideas.<br/><br/>That really, really shifted focus on the contents of the panel discussions.  Which is a good thing!  But it made creating a story game presence as an out reach thing really, really difficult because people we usually not able to commit to 3 to 4 hours for a single game.  The result was that while I had an awesome time meeting and playing with people I usually only deal with online, I didn't really feel that we connected with the rest of the con.<br/><br/>By contrast there was a guy over in the corner doing a really smart thing with D&amp;D4e.  I don't know if he was officially supported by WotC or a game store or what, but what he was doing was running little mini-adventures in 1 hour slots.  You picked up a character, you threw down a miniatures a couple of encounters later you were done.  And that's all you really need to do to show case the game.  It made me realize just how poorly "Story Games" scale.  It made me start thinking about games that might fit that format.  Which is probably worth its own thread so I won't go into details just now.<br/><br/>So, overall a success, but much food for thought.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_345683">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345683/#Comment_345683" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T11:46:11+00:00" title="October 12, 2011 11:46AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse,<br/><br/>   You make a great point. I think one of the more successful games we played was Zombie Cinema. We were able to knock it out in an hour or so and that fit very well with our companion's schedules.<br/><br/>I talked to the 4th ed guy a bit. Apparently he was completely unaffiliated with WotC, and he had only signed on because the organizer of the room had asked him to. Although he had obtained a good bit of swag from WotC once they figured out what he was up to. I got a dice set for playing a Dragonborn Paladin for an hour. Good times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_345690">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/345690/#Comment_345690" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-12T12:21:31+00:00" title="October 12, 2011 12:21PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jesse, all the con slots at PAX were 2 hours and I thought that was plenty long enough.
