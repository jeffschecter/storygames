I think it may be the last major thing I do because it will make game I always wanted. The challenge is how to write it and what art to put in it. What I'm thinking is to take Wells' text and chop it up, add in lots of pictures of modern toys and terrain, and use lots of text from classic adventure stories to show how we can describe scenes (Lovecraft, Howard, Stevenson, Wells of course, Dumas and others) to show how players can b writers. But I want it to also create rules that operationalize the kid game my brothers and I played with trolls and other toys. Where you can point at a place and say what happens. There are not so much rules as procedures.<br/><br/>This is going to be a big work and when it's done I'm not certain I'll have much left to say. What I'll need is help from a few people, some writers. I'd like Howard Whitehouse (need to contact him). Readers, pictures from people with cool toys, and accounts of their games. So help from classic writers and present gamers. <br/><br/>The idea is to use a book format like Don Featherstone did back in the sixties. It's a little daunting.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389025">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389025/#Comment_389025" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-01T19:04:13+00:00" title="September  1, 2012  7:04PM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It sounds great Chris.

In a way it might seem matrix gamely, because people say what happens from a god like perspective, but I'm aiming more at a "how kids play" feel. Someone points at a place and says X. Others accept or say no this is what happens. The difference is there will be rules to resolve the "bang bang you're dead" scenario.<br/><br/>I like the idea of making it a coffee table book.

I have it every time I set down and try to write up stuff in the vein you're talking about.<br/><br/>At the same time, I think this kind of playstyle, with minis, is great for all kinds of reasons. I want to share it with other people and get them to give it a try, including people I'll never meet face to face.<br/><br/>A paid for book does increase the chance that someone buying it ( or pirating it) will give it a certain amount of value just on those grounds.<br/><br/>I've considered whether maybe just having videos might be a better answer if the real goal is to show this thing, this general broad concept off, and get other folks out there in minis loving gamerland to take a stab at it.<br/><br/>I know you've already put together some videos, so you have some experience with it.<br/><br/>I'm just thinking this might be a better way to show and share the concept than tryng to write a book and sell it, at least initially.<br/><br/>It might be a great way to share ideas especially with different people scattered all over the globe, especially if other people are also invited to link up videos somehow.<br/><br/>It does seem like the core idea has fans, and they get it, it's just kinda hard to get the ideas across to folks that might be interested, but think that minis use or rpgs/sgs only work a certain way. Showing it might be more useful.<br/><br/>Which doesn't preclude your publication or anyone else's from being a success. It's more like laying the groundwork for it by networking with likeminded individuals, while giving the interested but unsure a good solid look at the thing in a way that doesn't cost them more than a few minutes of viewing time per video.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_389286">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389286/#Comment_389286" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-05T06:30:57+00:00" title="September  5, 2012  6:30AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Videos are a good idea. These are games that would be fun to watch because they are spontaneous. The video would require editing and camera angles so they would start with a wide shot of the game to capture it and the sound, the going back to do set up shots and re-record the sound. It is some work but it would be work that would make it so much better. <br/><br/>I may do that. I'd need a camera just for that and better sound...
