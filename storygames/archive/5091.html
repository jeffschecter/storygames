In fact, I've been working on it a good bit in my spare time.  Would anyone be interested in playing in a weekly or bi-weekly game on Tuesday or Thursday evenings (EST)?  My idea is to run through the <i>Tomb of Abysthor </i>module then discuss whether we want to continue to play after that.  So, while this will be more than a session or two it is not a neverending commitment either.  If you are interested, give me a shout and I'll see about compiling an email list and then getting the things started after the beginning of the year.<br/><br/>~Andrew                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_114986">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21" title="Ken Sentowski!"><img alt="Ken Sentowski!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ken%20Sentowski%21">Ken Sentowski!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114986/#Comment_114986" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T08:25:52+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  8:25AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm down for giving it a whirl.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_114994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/114994/#Comment_114994" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-18T08:35:16+00:00" title="December 18, 2007  8:35AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, put me on the list.

I haven't played D&amp;D since 1991.  Gaerik, my only request is that we find out a little bit about the adventure <i>before</i> making characters, so we can build little dungeon-specific flags into the background material, and maybe have a pre-selected reason for why we're all sticking together to do this stuff.

It's irritating to create a good character only to find that he'll be among overtly evil characters that he'd realistically attempt to redeem or kill... Which can be great if you're prepared for that, but when you're just in for a little dungeon-delving, having to handwave interpersonal conflicts is annoying.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf we're going to go for the generally good side of things that D&amp;D tends to encourage, great. If we're thinking more morally ambiguous characters, that's fine too.. But some idea up front is what I'm going for.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, I'm not familiar with the module, so I don't know if it is attached to any particular setting.. So do you have a setting in mind? The basic proto-setting outlined in the PHB? I've a fondness for Eberron if the group is flexible.. But I'm good either way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115509">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115509/#Comment_115509" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-20T06:27:52+00:00" title="December 20, 2007  6:27AM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 20, 2007 6:57AM by Gaerik.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with James and Lance.  I'd prefer that the players add their own hooks into their characters.  So, here's what I've got so far about the game.<br/><br/>My goal stylistically for the campaign is to strike a nice balance between role-playing/storytelling and a good, old fashion dungeon crawl.  I expect there to be a about a 40/60 split between the two things.  That doesn't mean that every session will have that ratio but rather the ratio should hold up over the course of the whole game.  Some sessions might be 90% dungeon crawling while another session might be 90% social interaction outside the dungeon or with denizens of said dungeon.  Hopefully this kind of game appeals to you.  If not, let's talk about it.<br/><br/>I'd like people to post their ideas about characters they are wanting to play.  What I'd especially like is for you as players to connect your characters together in a way that makes sense.  Why are they traveling into the Stoneheart Dungeon?  I can't see them as a collection of strangers who just happened to bump into each other and say, "Whoa!  Let's go dungeon delving!"  So, how do they know each other and why are they doing what they're doing?  Which brings us to setting....<br/><br/>It makes it easier on you guys to come up with cool things to do and reasons for doing them if you have some setting elements to hang your ideas on.  I'm going to give you some of those.  Please, if you have any ideas that go beyond the ones I list, feel free to express them.  The setting as it stands right now is sketchy and only a loose framework to get you started.  I'd like to see the setting really develop during play with most of it coming from the ideas of the players.<br/><br/>Setting Elements\n<ul>\n<li>Abysthor, High Priest of Thyr - Received a vision from his god and disappeared into the Stoneheart Dungeon some 15 years ago. <br/></li><li>Thyr - God of Justice <br/></li><li>Muir - Goddess of Virtue (Paladins) <br/></li><li>The worship of Thyr and Muir have slowly decline over the last decades.  They have lost followers to the newer gods who are not quite so strict in their worship requirements.  The Stoneheart Dungeon used to be a burial place for their heroic dead but with the decline of their sects, the place has fallen into corruption. <br/></li><li>The tomb of Alaric, Paladin of Muir - A long dead hero with his tomb located somewhere in the Stoneheart Dungeon. <br/></li><li>A tribe of Gnolls - There is a tribe of Gnolls living in the area of the Stoneheart Dungeon somewhere. <br/></li><li>A young dragon - A young dragon has been spotted in recent years and has probably established a lair nearby. <br/></li><li>A beholder - Rumors of a beholder lairing in the area have cropped up lately. <br/></li><li>Cult of Orcus - Evil followers of the demonlord of the Undead have taken up residence in the Stoneheart Dungeon and are desecrating the burial sites located there. <br/></li><li>The city of Bard's Gate is concerned about the increased activity of monsters and evil men in the vicinity of the Stoneheart Dungeon.  The location is only a day or so travel away in the nearby Valley of the Shrines in the Stoneheart Mountains.  This kind of activity rarely bodes well. <br/></li></ul>\nOther than these things, the setting is fairly wide open.  Feel free to add stuff or expand things already listed.<br/><br/>Characters should be made with the Standard Point Buy system with 28 points.  All characters should start at an Effective Character Level of 2 and should have the standard wealth of characters at that level, which is 900 gold pieces.  You can have any items that you can afford with 900 gold that are listed in the DMG.  I am not banning any sourcebooks.  However, if you have a race or class you'd like to play that isn't listed in the PHB or DMG, then you need to ask me about it.  I'm fairly easy going about that kind of thing as long as it isn't too bizarre/powerful.<br/><br/>We need to decide on the day and time for the game.  My preference is either Tuesday or Thursday starting at 5- 6 in the evening and running until 9 pm, Eastern Standard Time.  I might be able to work out Friday instead but Tuesday and Thursday work better for me.  I'd like to play once a week.  If that's too much with most, I can go for every other week.  I don't want to get slower than that.  Christmas and New Years is upon us and I have a cruise with my wife from January 6th - January 11th.  We might get 1 or 2 sessions in before my cruise or if people would prefer to wait until mid-January to get started, that's fine too.  Let me know what you think.<br/><br/>Have I missed anything?

We can always discuss/negotiate over setting elements that you've added later if need be.  Don't worry about niche protection.  That's not a big concern of mine.  Making sure all the niches are actually covered is more important.<br/><br/>If we have 4 to 6 players, we'll keep the characters at 2nd level.

(Wizard role, I'd like to take multiple bloodline/heritage feats for more spell selection so I can cover the required versatility - I could even go Mystic Theurge from this role depending on whether the party can handle me multiclassing that way).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_115944">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack" title="James_Nostack"><img alt="James_Nostack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Nostack">James_Nostack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115944/#Comment_115944" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T15:30:52+00:00" title="December 21, 2007  3:30PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 21, 2007 6:26PM by James_Nostack.">edited December 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1 - A seasoned burglar who has "seen the light" and has joined the Holy Military Order of Muir (or something) to expiate old sins.  Expertise would involve melee flanking, with a minor in trapfinding &amp; lockpicking.<br/>\n<br/>\nHooks might involve the Old Gang (who may have left this character for dead, or are up to no good in the area, or may seek to convert either sincerely or as part of a scam); inquisitors who frown on his/her past life (either as an internal political adversary, or as a way of blackmailing the character into further indiscretions); a wealthy merchant badly wronged by this thief (sending minions against him or providing information to enemies; figuring ways to harass the party).<br/>\n<br/>\nThis character may have organized the expedition to prove his/her worthiness to peers--a bit of status-seeking.  Alternately, the character may have been appointed by superiors to assist an officially sanctioned expedition.<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n2 - A dramaturge driven out of favor with the court through the machinations of religious zealots, who proposes an expedition to the forgotten tombs of an unfashionable sect as a way to criticize the lax observances and insipid theologies of the now-dominant faiths.  Expertise: diplomacy, buffing, and obscure knowledge; minors in everything else.<br/>\n<br/>\nHooks include an impetuous spoiled court runaway (either captured by gnolls, or stupidly insisting on following the party); a financial crisis at the playhouse (requiring urgent production of gold or ancient treasures--or, perhaps, a bit larceny in the town); rumors of dimwitted, easily cheated gnoll stage-laborers (either as a resource to be found and exploited, or as irresponsible troublemaking servants); perhaps capturing a dragon or beholder, King-kong style.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe playwright may have organized the expedition to serve his or her own need to one-up rivals with lost legendry.  Alternately, the playwright, exiled from the capital and looking for work, may be picking up some money as a scholar, historian, and translator.<br/>\n<hr class="bbcode_rule"/>\n3 - An ex-nun of the Orcus cult, who left them to gain greater command of the sinister necromantic arts.  Expertise includes undead-management, diabolical conjurations, and estate planning.  Minors include religious lore and bitter denunciations of her ex-colleagues.<br/>\n<br/>\nHooks might include an irritating ghost with a laundry list of tasks in exchange for hints and dire predictions; a wizardly rival who hopes to steal the Orcus McGuffin and interfere with the mission; or a love interest in the Orcus cult who refuses to leave his foolish brothers.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs a principal, this character is your standard ambitious magician, eager to exploit the zeal of the churchmen and the greed of mercenaries to clean out the Orcus cult.  As an agent or contractor, she might, perhaps, have an unconscious desire to find a purpose larger than the mastery of arcane power - but was brought on to deal with freaky ghosts, ancient lore, and the inevitable horde of undead skeleton armies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_115950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik" title="Gaerik"><img alt="Gaerik" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Gaerik">Gaerik</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/115950/#Comment_115950" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-21T16:08:47+00:00" title="December 21, 2007  4:08PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You guys kick ass!

I'm back now.<br/><br/>Either Tuesday or Thursday is good for me, but only once a week, I think.<br/><br/>And I can't get home and online before 6 PM EST.  Starting around 6:30 or 7 PM would work better.<br/><br/>OK, concepts... hmmm<br/><br/>1)  A dwarven locksmith and trapfinder (i.e. rogue) who has a mercenary outlook on life.  He's only coming along because of the challenge and what it will do for his reputation (plus any loot he might find).  Greed is definitely his big weakness.<br/><br/>2)  A disgraced human fighter who has been branded as a coward (literally branded).  He now seeks to redeem his reputation by entering the most dangerous place he knows.  Likely to be reckless.<br/><br/>3)  An half-orc cleric of Thyr who has reached a crisis of faith as his church falters.  He hopes to find some sign of his god in the dungeon, but doubts that her own motives are pure.<br/><br/>And just to round things out...<br/><br/>4)  An elven wizard who flunked out of a university for not completing her coursework.  She is vain and arrogant, but cowardly.<br/><br/>Hope I still can get in on this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_116358">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/116358/#Comment_116358" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-12-26T15:37:29+00:00" title="December 26, 2007  3:37PM">December 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think you're still good, Jeff. <br/>\n<br/>\nCheck out the thread "[D&amp;D] Tomb of Abysthor Online Game", where additional conversation, leading up into character generation, is ongoing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
