The tenants responsible apologized for their clumsiness but were clearly under some sort of hypnotic influence. Theo was Targeted for his interference.<br/><br/>Flashback 2: In a previous episode, Magda arrived from a parallel world and was briefly driven mad by the presence of our impossibly large moon. Lenora coaxed her out of the ocean and back to her office before the police could intervene, suffering Hypothermia as a result.<br/><br/>Flashback 3: In a recent episode, Billy was drawn into the Psionic Vortex and nearly devoured by the Etheric Monstrosity before being rescued by Magda, who drove the creature away with a surprisingly powerful bowl of geraniums.<br/><br/>Flashback 4: During that battle, Theo was caught off-balance when the Ghost Path twisted under his feet, threatening to pitch him into the Psionic Vortex. Billy caught his hand in the nick of time and Lenora and Magda formed a human chain to pull them free.<br/><br/>End of Round: Threats vs. Freedom<br/>The Etheric Monstrosity hits. The heroes learn that it's just devoured the last of our psychic and mystic allies, and now it's entirely up to us to save the world.<br/>The Lunar Mystery hits. After countless eons, the Stygians' plan is finally reaching fruition. They have established a solid foothold on our Earth by somehow using the power of the Moon.<br/><br/>Freedom Status: 4 / 6 hits remaining<br/><br/>Turn 1: The Lunar Mystery<br/>Wild speculation regarding the effect of the Moon on planar travel leads our heroes to map out the ley lines of our Earth and confirm that they have been twisted into the Stygian Gate Configuration foretold in theosophic texts. A temporary tunnel to the Abyss has opened and the imprisoned spirits within are preparing to wreak havoc on the multiverse once again.<br/><br/>Turn 2: The Stygian Marauders<br/>The completed ley line diagram leads to an investigation of the focal point of the distortion, a brownstone apartment in Hell's Kitchen. Ambushed by hypnotized tenants, our heroes are forced to retreat through the Gate, tumbling out into a blasted wasteland. Narrowly avoiding detection by the resident evil spirits, they quickly and explosively sabotage the Marauders' psychic machinery and dive back through the dimensional tunnel as it collapses behind them.<br/><br/>Turn 3: Theo vs. The Etheric Monstrosity<br/>Our heroes stumble out into the street just as the brownstone implodes. The dimensional shockwave supercharges the Psionic Vortex and all of New York is suddenly thrown into the Ether. Theo draws his Blade and faces down the oncoming Monstrosity, nearly destroying it (5 hits), before a flailing tentacle blindsides him and casts him into the Vortex (11 danger).<br/><br/>Turn 4: Lenora vs. the Etheric Monstrosity<br/>As Theo's sword falls to the ground and crazed New Yorkers run mad through the streets, Lenora draws her .38 and shoots the weakened Monstrosity in several of its thousand eyes. It shrieks and explodes in a shower of supernatural ectoplasmic energy, the force of the psychic feedback leaving Lenora reeling and defenseless in the path of a rampaging mob.<br/><br/>End of Round: Threats vs. Freedom<br/>The Unstable Mind Control and Psionic Vortex both hit. "Everybody's losing their minds."<br/><br/>Freedom Status: 2 / 6 hits remaining<br/><br/>Turn 5: The Unstable Mind Control<br/>Billy attempts to shield the crowd from the madness of the Ether, but his wounds cause him to falter and the mob batters him senseless. Staggering, he trips over Theo's fallen sword, picks it up and sweeps the ghostly blade through the horde, dispelling their insanity.<br/><br/>Turn 6: The Psionic Vortex<br/>Trees bending and twisting around her, Magda steps out into the street and summons her indescribable Multi-Planar powers to silence the storm at last. Billy and Lenora watch in horror as the full moon slowly "separates out like bubbles of oil scattering across the sky" while Magda unconvincingly reassures them that it's for the best and that we didn't really need it anyway.<br/><br/>Freedom Status: Restored<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
