I played two games the whole weekend, which was disappointing, but they were fun games at least. I participated in four panel discussions, which were, by and large, pretty great. I spent a lot of time stumbling around looking at people and things as well. I made some new friends and saw some old ones! <br/><br/>Gaming at Dragon Con is not a huge focus, and what gaming there is tends to be tightly structured and organized. My efforts at pick up and play were ... not successful. But the panels were packed with people who want to play and design weird games, and I have some ideas about both making them more accessible and introducing an even wider swatch of D*C attendees to gaming through the lens of the thing they are obsessively enthusiastic about. On a whim I sat in on a panel called "Steampunk and Orientalism", and it was intense - name-checking Edward Said intense. Discussing Muhammed Ali's relations with the Ottoman Empire intense. So more of that next year I think.<br/><br/>Finally I saw a couple of costumes that were <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/cosplayinamerica/sets/72157627466112013/with/6112426126/" rel="nofollow">OK, I guess</a>.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341657">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341657/#Comment_341657" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T16:20:56+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  4:20PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 5, 2011 6:53PM by Scott.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Jason,<br/>I wish DragonCon had a better gaming experience and would be hopeful that this may be improved.  There are pockets of very interesting people here and there.  Personally I had a pretty good time even though personal issues made my attendance a bit spotty.  I played in Dungeon World (run by you) and several of us broke out Fiasco although none of us had played it before.  I also ran Dungeon World and Amber Diceless.  The only thing I really wanted to do and couldn't was go to the feedback meeting about RPGaming after the con to push for more indie/small press games.  Here's hoping the powers that be see us as valuable and try to create an even better setting next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Skage" title="Skage"><img alt="Skage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Skage">Skage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341659/#Comment_341659" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-05T16:52:21+00:00" title="September  5, 2011  4:52PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played two games of Dungeon World, two games of Fiasco, and ran one Lady Blackbird game.

I played in 4 games, 3 Fiascos, two with Skage and friends and one with Harlequin and crew. All of them were very different. I died in my second scene in the Harlequin game, and the game became totally about the void my character left. Very interesting.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also wandered around a lot, missed some musterings of people (including being 3 minutes too late to get into a screening with friends), saw Ralph Bakshi's Wizards with an enthusiastic audience, made new friends and had amazing experiences with old ones. In all it was pretty great, and I managed not to get that run-down feeling I often get in the middle of Cons.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm hopeful that we've met a critical mass of people and that future story/indie games pick-up culture will expand as a result. We may still be a year or two away from official recognition, but I have ideas for next year, lacking that. We can definitely put up the necessary people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341869">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JuddG" title="JuddG"><img alt="JuddG" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.juddgoswick.com/icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JuddG">JuddG</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341869/#Comment_341869" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T15:56:25+00:00" title="September  7, 2011  3:56PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I missed it this year, a friend of mine who went said it seemed almost gamer-hostile this year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_341881">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DrTachyon" title="DrTachyon"><img alt="DrTachyon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DrTachyon">DrTachyon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341881/#Comment_341881" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T18:13:16+00:00" title="September  7, 2011  6:13PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I went to a lot of panels (including one of the awesome Indie Game panels), played a lot of Werewolf and had a lot of fun.

I would love to send them your way, Jason, but I've mislaid your email address.<br><br>The Mountain Witch, I had three players turn up.  All were fans of the genre, so we had that going for us.  I told them 4 hours was just enough to give a taste for it, and we got a lot done.  Reached a suitable conclusion, and took some wicked cool scenes and visuals away.  That's about all you can expect in a short time.  We had some creative constipation here and there, but I see that all the time with this game.  At the end, during the final conflict and epilogues, they all went "oh, I could have been doing that all along" and were really excited to try it again.<br><br>Kagematsu had three totally new players.  One player was a little too much of a GM at times, but with constant guidance, he worked out.  They got in the groove and worked towards a semi-tragic, entirely thematic ending.  Delicious.  Even had a passer-by want to take a character sheet home with him so he could find the game later.  Woot!  Plus, I got to talk about it to another GM who was looking for a game to play with females.<br/><br/>Puppetland was great, and the only game I took a recording of.  I was totally surprised by one of the players... usually he screws off and disrupts, but the game went awesomely well.  A fine way to end the con off.  Our Kagematsu from earlier came back to play, and we did a lot in our little hour.  Picking the "cans" and "cannots" took some time, but we had one person at the table who had only played one RPG ever before this one, and I mean one "session" ever.  The game tought itself.<br/>The take away from this was the scene where Detective Higgins had snuck up on some Nutcrackers who (I had decided) couldn't swim.  They were on a dock that was tied to the shore, and the player had to decide whether to untie the dock and push it outonto the lake, effectively murdering the Nutcrackers, or find a peacable solution.<br/>He chose murder, but reluctantly, to save his friends.  It was tense, and well worth the game by itself.<br/><br/>The pickup of Ganakagok was deliciously dynamic.  We had a few intinsely personal scenes, with a backdrop of earth-shattering events.  The game was really well showcased.  The world was literally being devoured by cannibal spirits, and at one point, the ice mountain was eclipsed in fog.  A horrible noise came, and they feared the mountain was being devoured, but they couldn't / wouldn't confront it directly.  So Anuk the great bear abandoned the people to go and fight the spirits for the health of the Mountain.<br/>Also, the village was being torn by a struggle for power, which was based on the number of children a couple could produce.  Naturally, one of the player took "Barren, 3 points" as a burden.  Bang!  <br/>One scene was actually over trying to overcome this limitation.  It sounds totally creepy in text, but it can't compare to the actual execution of the scene, where the village was gathered around watching this "ritual."  There wasn't even a marriage before-hand, so that the man (from another village) wouldn't have to suffer the shame of marrying her if she wasn't capable of conception.<br/>But we trusted each other, and approached the scene properly, and it was a great scene in the end.<br/><br/>Fiasco with Remi and Joey and Ken went well.  Little funny, little messy, hella violent... good game.<br/><br/>ALL OF MY GAMES MADE!!! AT DRAGON*CON!!! You have no idea how rare that is and how awesome that is.<br/>While I'm super excited that the Dresden RPG brough people into the gaming track from... wherever they came... I'm always a little sad when we can't reach out to other fandoms and get them to play with us.  This year worked out... at least for the offerings I put up.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_341908">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord" title="SquidLord"><img alt="SquidLord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/690/n6I44LRPBAB7W.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">SquidLord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341908/#Comment_341908" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-07T23:07:39+00:00" title="September  7, 2011 11:07PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 7, 2011 11:07PM by SquidLord.">edited September 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I was staffing the Disability Services group at D*C this year and the only pass I even made by the Hilton gaming area was very, very <em>en passant</em> on my way to the <strong>Son Of ...</strong> screening (which I was obliged to attend since I designed the poster/flier for it and helped find some content; I was kissed by a lesbian there for my singing voice, so it could've been worse).</p>\n<p>Talk about gaming as an activity was down this year in overall Con discussion outside of the track itself; in past years, I've heard way more chatter in the halls. I think its a very real thing that MMOs are reprocessing a lot of the energy that used to go into traditional gaming and some of the push in the Gaming Department on rigid trad forms (including scheduling) versus more indie-friendly structures is in subtle reaction to that. I expect it'll shift on over in the next couple years because trying to put <em>4e</em> head-to-head with <em>World of Warcraft</em> is going to be a losing proposition for a while to come.</p>\n<p>And now I get to shift gears to working Security at Anime Weekend Atlanta where maybe, just maybe, I'll have more evening free-time and get to run some <em>Microscope</em> ... or at least get into the drum circle with my portable synth. Maybe.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
