Everyone generally agrees that's unlikely, but I think I have a handle on why that is.  It has nothing to do with technological options like video games or TV being easier / more appealing.  Or rather, they are easier, but not because they're technological.<br/><br/>Rather, it is that anything that can be considered real roleplaying* requires <i>a willingness to be vulnerable in a social situation</i>.  This isn't about Creative Agenda, though I might argue that the (need for) vulnerability is most profound in Narr games.  It's simply the nature of the activity that when participating in it we open ourselves up to have our very deeply realized personal visions fail, be criticized, or even be subject to ridicule.<br/><br/>Think about the stereotypical group of beginning gamers: awkward teenage boys.  They're looking for closeness and connection with other people, as well as the sort of "awesomeness" that is packaged into the idea of being a kickass wizard or whatever.  But sometimes they don't like what they find so much.  The kinds of recrimination and arguments that such groups often experience don't just have to do with bad rules design, but more to do with people who are at an extremely emotionally vulnerable stage discovering that, hey, this roleplaying thing can really hurt when it goes badly.  Conversely, people who were awkward teens or tweens when they started gaming but who managed to have functional experiences with it will often really grow and change as a result.<br/><br/>Nota bene: GMing also requires this willingness to be open and vulnerable.<br/><br/>Matt<br/> <br/>*This isn't a thread about 4E, but maybe part of its appeal, but also part of the reason so many people pan it as "not a real RPG" can be explained not only by how close it is to a boardgame but that *along with* the fact that it's quite forgiving.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284005">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284005/#Comment_284005" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T12:14:26+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 12:14PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2010 12:16PM by mease19.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would take it one step further, role playing requires a willingness to be vulnerable in social situation, which requires trust.  Role playing games are an expression of how the world works and how people work.  Gaming shows people these truths by explicitly modeling human psychology, sociology, and physiology and by explaining a system by which these factors interact with their [un-] natural [perhaps quasi- or sur-] reality.  Vulnerability and weakness is an inherent part of this inner and outer exploration, however, I think more importantly it requires trust.  One big difference that I see among gamers is that, I believe, they are more accepting and trusting crowd.  In many ways, good RP is the social equivalent of a "trust fall".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284007/#Comment_284007" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T12:26:26+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 12:26PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It doesn't work as a general principle for me, unless you define "real roleplaying" so that it's a tautology or your standard for "vulnerable" is exceedingly low.<br/><br/>I mean, every one of those asshole jocks that are so much fun to demonize has had a coach criticize his play style, his attitude, his aggressiveness level, his physical technique for playing the game.  They (I might say "we" here, but it's been a long time) are *accustomed* to having their best physical efforts fail, be criticized, and be subjected to ridicule.  An unwillingness to risk that level of vulnerability is not why asshole jocks are not playing roleplaying games, because if it were, well, they wouldn't be playing sports, either.<br/><br/>And most of the teenaged boys I've seen arguing over roleplaying games -- it's not that roleplaying hurts when it goes badly, but that when you equate you winning with your character winning, and your character loses, you feel like you have lost, and losing hurts; but because it's a shared fantasy and there are a couple hundred pages of rules, you might be able to argue your way to winning.  The asshole jocks are doing the same thing -- but instead of arguing over whether it was right that Thog the Mighty-Thewed Warrior died when he took on the red dragon and rolled two 1s in a row, they're arguing over whether the Red Sox would be having a better season if Josh Beckett had not wound up on the 60-day disabled list.  And they're not identifying so strongly with Josh Beckett as at least one gamer is identifying with Thog, so it's far less personal.<br/><br/>I would buy a claim that many roleplaying games are more satisfying if you allow yourself to be vulnerable, but I don't think it's anywhere near a requirement for everything I'd call real roleplaying.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284011/#Comment_284011" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T12:56:57+00:00" title="August  2, 2010 12:56PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Great posts, both of you!

It is something I have been thinking about lately.<br/><br/>I try to play RPGs with my friends who don't normally play them. Usually the experience is a good one; I rarely convert non-gamers to avid gamers (okay, never), but everyone usually has fun, and it's always cool to step back and see role-playing games as these really amazing tools for entertaining one another and creating stories (or fiction, whatever) together.<br/><br/>However, I had a not-great experience along those lines recently. Someone was invited to join a game who had no real idea what was in store (she was invited only to "game night!", which can mean lots of things), and was not super enthused when she figured out what was up. We pressed on, and the evening was not a total loss, but it was a constant effort to keep the game from collapsing.<br/><br/>It *is* socially awkward to play an RPG if you aren't used to it, and it's "safe" to make jokes and innoculate yourself by mocking the very activity you're participating in. ("Okay, well, I guess I'll roll some crazy dice to see if I can kill that vampire, or whatever it is...")<br/><br/>I think the reason people take that approach is because of the vulnerability you're talking about. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite>I would buy a claim that many roleplaying games are more satisfying if you allow yourself to be vulnerable, but I don't think it's anywhere near a requirement for everything I'd call real roleplaying.</blockquote>\nI think that it is, and that's true of most RPGs, regardless of where they fall on the (mutating, murky, useless) scale of traditional to indie.<br/><br/>I have a friend whose husband is a gamer, and I have tried for YEARS to get her to play, but she's convinced she'll hate it, and she won't be able to think of anything to say, and she'll face horrid performance anxiety.<br/><br/>Of course, it wouldn't be like that, because good games are tools that help us do that stuff, but it's difficult to get past that idea for some people, because it does require making yourself socially vulnerable - sharing your ideas, your creative powers, the dialogue you invent, all that stuff. Most leisure pursuits do not ask that of us.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284023/#Comment_284023" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T14:52:19+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  2:52PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Your not wrong.<br/>\n<br/>\n<i>TODAY'S</i> rpgs do require heaps of vulnerability.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook to cranium.<br/>\n<br/>\nLook at it,<br/>\n<br/>\nMarvel at how brilliantly it solves the problems of adult party games.<br/>\n<br/>\nUnderstand that the problems of game play can be solved while keeping the best of the experience intact.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you want play to be creative you must have a game that builds the confidence to do so, otherwise your game will only work for the people who are already confident.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284029/#Comment_284029" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T15:10:05+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  3:10PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

I totally agree.<br><br>I find it interesting to think about how that requirement for vulnerability shapes the kinds of games that people play, and the kinds of people who play games. I think absolutely that the degree of violence in roleplaying games is in part a way of covering for or neutralising that vulnerability. Maybe this is too spicy for the internet, but I think it's no coincidence that groups of adolescent boys doing an intimate thing together would turn to violence and ultra-masculine imagery to make that behaviour "safe". My game "Dungeonfuckers" is in many ways about unpacking and deconstructing that association.<br><br>Acknowledging roleplaying as a vulnerable activity that requires trust and compassion, and actively promoting that kind of trusting, even loving environment in a group has improved the quality of my play immensely. The group I played Bliss Stage with actively discussed the fact that we would be delaing with difficult and emotional subjects, and we explicitly agreed to support each other through that, and to try not to deflect and minimise that vulnerability.

The implication from this thread, though, is that because I'm not all that vulnerable, what I'm doing is not roleplaying, because roleplaying requires vulnerability. <br/><br/>These conclusions do not make sense to me, and yet it seems to me that it follows logically from what you're claiming.<br/><br/>It also occurs to me that I've seen a *lot* more mockery involved when someone steps up to the plate in a pickup softball game than I ever have around a gaming table, and yet I think the analogous claim - that a *real* softball game requires the players to be vulnerable - is ridiculous on its face. <br/><br/>(I also don't follow the Cranium example, because I've played it exactly once and bowed out several turns in because I found it deathly boring.

Everyone at your table understands how role-playing games work, and you understand the "rules" - not the game rules, like a shovel does 2d4 damage, but the social context in which a role-playing game happens, the social context in which one person says "The vampire penguin leaps at you!" and another person responds "Oh yeah! I wham it with my shovel. 2d4 damage!".<br/><br/>Someone new to all this who sits down will likely experience some confusion or anxiety or fear or what-have-you because they don't know that stuff (yet). How do you talk? How do you know what to do? Do you have to speak in dialogue? How do you win? What are the weird dice for? What if I'm not clever, or entertaining, or funny? Etc.<br/><br/>So that new person can either take refuge in jokes or mockery or hyper-violence - any of which will protect them socially (and emotionally), or they can engage with the game in a more serious way - playing their character and contributing to the game fiction. Which requires them to be vulnerable. Which is bold! And leads to a more fun game for everyone, I think.<br/><br/>Obviously this is different for experienced gamers, but I'm talking more about new players, which I think is the context suggested by the OP.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284051">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284051/#Comment_284051" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T16:57:04+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  4:57PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Posted By: Brian Minter&lt;/cite&gt;<br/>\nAlso, I don't follow the 'Cranium' example.

Cranium side steps this problem by upping the number of skills included in the game, the skills themselves are rather diverse, math, drawing, sculpting, humming, performance. it's probably hard to find a person in a party who can not do at least one of those things and enjoy it.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlong with some clever distribution cranium did really really well for it'self.<br/>\n<br/>\nI brought up cranium because it was able to solve a problem that before cranium existed was just accepted as a reality of party games. invention is solving problems, really successful inventions transcend this by solving a problem people accept as a reality.<br/>\n<br/>\ni think requiring vulnerability is such a problem.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284058/#Comment_284058" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T18:15:54+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  6:15PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The vulnerability isn't about not knowing the rules or fear of not performing well (although those things also happen) the vulnerability is saying "I care about this" or "this makes me excited" or "I don't know how I feel about this".

Is that a fairer statement about what you think?  Because *that* I can agree with 100%.  At the same time, it's almost a truism -- no matter what social activity you're talking about, there will be people who are scared to try it -- I think the RPG fear is just most apparent to RPG players because we see so much of it, but it's there for just about every other social activity.  <br><br>Simon: Right, and I think that players allowing themselves that vulnerability can make a good game great, so I agree with you there.  When you put something you care about out into the fiction, and it *works*, it's an amazing feeling.  And I've seen games fail for some players because they played with too much distance -- in a lot of GMless games, you have to care about the characters and the conflicts they're in, or the game Just Doesn't Work.<br><br>(But neither of these is the point I was objecting to, which is that all roleplaying games require vulnerability.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284063/#Comment_284063" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T18:36:55+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  6:36PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>RPGs definitely require putting yourself up for<b>judgment</b>by your friends in a way many other things don't.</blockquote>\nSee, that I'll buy, and it explains a lot of why this doesn't make sense to me: I'm not afraid of being judged.<br><br>That's radical, Charlton.<br><br/>I, personally, am very afraid of being judged. A good, healthy kind of fear. The kind that keeps me invested in the game. The kind that makes me want to forgive any lackluster contributions of others, so that in turn we'll have more trust between us. The kind that makes me want the whole experience to work.<br/><br/>When we are in the spotlight, it can put us on edge. But if we can manage to handle that edge, that anxiety, we emerge more attentive, taking greater stewardship over the results. Feeling more accomplished when it goes well. That we are all sharing that spotlight together helps build trust and confidence, but there is still a fundamental vulnerability to being creative, and I think it's a good thing.<br/><br/>I don't think that "creative people" face unprecedented vulnerability. But it's a different vulnerability than you face when you're on a basketball team. It's "I made this, and think this is the direction we should go," versus "this is the limit of what I am capable of."

One of the ways that many games do this is by giving players control over just one character, and giving them the mandate to say whatever they like about that character. It's a dodge. "I'm not saying that I think the game should go in this direction, I'm just saying that I think that's what my character would do". OF COURSE you're saying you want the game to go in that direction, but having the character there lets you pretend that you're just playing the character.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284074/#Comment_284074" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T20:21:44+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  8:21PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2010 8:25PM by nemomeme.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know if this is quite on topic; a lot of the focus of this thread seems to be on performance anxiety and the thesis that even the most basic forms of role-playing involve some measure of vulnerability.<br/><br/>But reading the thread invokes these possibly tangential observations.  I've had a lot of pretty good role-playing recently and the two games I'm playing a bunch of are Apocalypse World (one-shots and two campaigns) and Love in the Time of Sei\xf0.  I don't think of myself as "emo porn catharsis guy" (maybe I'm just in denial - in my defense one of my favorite games is Danger Patrol!), but it occurs to me that player willingness to be vulnerable is one of the key components in what's made some of my recent gaming so excellent.<br/><br/>You take a game like Apocalypse World and you pitch it to an array of gamers, people already comfortable with pretending to be other people, maybe talking in funny voices and rolling oddly-shaped dice, etc.  They look though the rules and read a couple APs.  Holy ****!  The PCs might get in each others faces and fight with each other!  T<i>hey might even... have sex with each another.  I might have to pretend that my character is having sex with someone else's character.  Probably even someone who's gender is not in alignment with my sexual orientation!</i><br/><br/>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0 - Same thing!  And my character will probably die or lose in some other manner!  And it's GM-less; I'll have to improvise a bunch of stuff.  I'll totally be in the hotseat!<br/><br/>My point is that both of these games have a natural filtering dynamic for their audiences.  Unless the participants really drift the game, it's going to involve some significant vulnerability.  For me personally, that's where a lot of the value and fun is.<br/><br/>Inside of both of these games I'm now recalling that there's an additional level of vulnerability that can make some really golden scenes.  Aping their real world counterparts in emotional nakedness, it's the post-coital scenes.  Talk about vulnerability!  Even if you totally fade to black on the act itself (my common preference), you've got two fictional characters being played by two real people and there was likely some heavy emotional grist that led to that act.  Now comes the even harder part.  What do you say to each other afterwords?  It's different based on context, but it's almost always really good.  Like the fictional conceit has prepped both of its actors to express something transcendent or, at a minimum, real.<br/><br/>Sorry if this was digressive, Matt.  Maybe it's the case that at least part of what prevents role-playing games up to now from becoming the next soccer, cross-stitching, or even World of Warcraft, is the willingness to be vulnerable.  But it also happens that it's a significant part of why I love this hobby, at least as expressed in singular moments of the kinds of role-playing games I enjoy most.<br/><br/>Take even bunch of couples and singles and put them in a room together with the express social agenda of cutting loose, hanging out, and getting to know each other.  Maybe a bunch of them have known each other for years even.  Add alcohol, its suppression of inhibitions and the accompanying understood permissiveness allowed by same to "get real" and maybe be a little vulnerable.  And you STILL mostly get status games and a bunch of tedious small talk about inconsequential bullshit, stuff I can scarcely tolerate in my less generous moods.  Being vulnerable is difficult and rare.  I'm pretty sure that's built into the definition of the word.<br/><br/>Maybe this hobby will always be small but I'm thankful I've found people within it that are willing to express themselves creatively in ways that are especially vulnerable (being creative and sharing your creations with others is inherently vulnerable).  It's interesting (basic?) that it's largely done via avatars.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284075">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C" title="Simon_C"><img alt="Simon_C" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/Heartland/6459/apatosaurusk.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Simon_C">Simon_C</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284075/#Comment_284075" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T20:38:47+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  8:38PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good call Matthew.

A lot of it is that no judgment I am likely to receive at the hands of gamers is going to match the thoroughness or intimacy of the judgments I had to deal with in graduate school.  So at least in my case "fear" is the wrong word -- I care about my fellow players' judgment of what I have contributed, but it feels like a judgment of ideas and not a judgment of me.  If I do something great that they can play off of, the game will be even better, and I care about that, but if they don't like my contribution it's not a rejection of me. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: nemomeme</cite>Maybe it's the case that at least part of what prevents role-playing games up to now from becoming the next soccer, cross-stitching, or even World of Warcraft, is the willingness to be vulnerable.

It's possible to play many games in such a conventional way that nothing is really at risk.  (Witness: endless tables of RPGA games at trad cons, players all playing through similar stylized adventures in similar stylized ways.)  So I still resist the notion that vulnerability is an inherent part of roleplaying, because there are an awful lot of people doing something that looks a lot like roleplaying without any real vulnerability.  Maybe this isn't really disagreement about vulnerability, but disagreement about whether roleplaying requires creativity and whether playing a stylized role is creative or not -- and I can see that spawning a dozen offshoot threads.<br/><br/>At the same time, I completely agree that the most amazing roleplaying experiences I have had have involved investing myself in the character or the game somehow, and getting a major return on that investment.  So I'm not disagreeing that some of the most amazing roleplaying moments involve vulnerability and trust, not at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284079">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284079/#Comment_284079" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T21:46:55+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  9:46PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 2, 2010 9:50PM by Brian_Minter.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Simon C</cite>The vulnerability isn't about not knowing the rules or fear of not performing well (although those things also happen) the vulnerability is saying "I care about this" or "this makes me excited" or "I don't know how I feel about this". The vulnerability is putting a small piece of yourself, something you care about, something you're invested in, naked and weak, entirely into the hands of your friends and their imaginations.<br/></blockquote>\nDefinitely! I agree completely. <br/><br/>But that thing is what I think is even more difficult for new players to do. That's what I was trying to say earlier, which I clearly did not do well. Aside from the lack of understanding about rules - formal and informal - there's a real (normal, healthy) anxiety about engaging in this way. And it's easy to hide from that by joking or not taking it seriously.<br/><br/>I disagree that this is just the same feeling we get from any new social activity. Role-playing games require a level of social and emotional and creative investment that most social activities do not. Like playing Cranium or bocce or knitting. I'm not saying its objectively better (of course) than other leisure pursuits. But it's fair to acknowledge that it asks things of us that many other activities do not.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284080/#Comment_284080" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-02T21:49:24+00:00" title="August  2, 2010  9:49PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I also don't think this vulnerability is limited to cutting-edge emo-porn games.

Especially about new players. Sometimes though I think that instead of learning to be comfortable being vulnerable, some players learn to go through the motions of play without ever making themselves very vulnerable.<br/><br/>I think it is worth examining how different games go about making the experience safer for participants. I think violent subject material (or rather, a particular <i>approach</i> to violence&gt;) is one way that's done. There are other ways. For example, the way Dogs aligns player goals while retaining opposed character goals.<br/><br/>Well designed rules can help create a safe space for emotional vulnerability.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor" title="IceCreamEmperor"><img alt="IceCreamEmperor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/IceCreamEmperor">IceCreamEmperor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284089/#Comment_284089" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T01:28:10+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  1:28AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2010 1:46AM by IceCreamEmperor.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I dunno, I think the OP is kind of looking at this backwards.<br/><br/>I have been roleplaying for a long time; I am fairly adept at the social activity of roleplaying. Consequently, I can easily protect myself from any emotional or social vulnerability while playing a roleplaying game. It is easy for me to withdraw, to step aside, to put up walls or even to act destructively towards play that I find upsetting. I mean, it's easy: these are <i>basic adult skills</i>, applied to a particular social medium. And I do this all the time, in momentary instances or even sometimes over entire sessions of play.<br/><br/>It's easy to not be vulnerable while playing a roleplaying game. It's harder if you don't know how they work, which of course is going to freak new players out -- that's been covered already pretty thoroughly, but it doesn't seem to be about <i>being vulnerable</i> so much as <i>having no control over how vulnerable you will be</i>. But in any case it is much harder to maintain vulnerability -- to stretch the rubber band without having it snap back. That's kind of a major roleplaying skillset, to my mind -- to be vulnerable on purpose, to bypass the basic social and emotional instincts that let you back off or defuse vulnerable situations.<br/><br/>And in case it wasn't obvious, I'm with Charlton on the OP -- no way does roleplaying <i>require</i> vulnerability, unless taking the subway to work does too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284126">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator" title="Deliverator"><img alt="Deliverator" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/109/nKP8VPA3YE5G4.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deliverator">Deliverator</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284126/#Comment_284126" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T09:15:19+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  9:15AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            mease, Brian, Simon C, Mark W: thanks for clarifying my thoughts from the OP.<br/><br/>I do agree that what I said initially could be interpreted to be fallacious or stupid.  Yes, of course athletes face criticism from coaches or teammates.  So do saxophone players!  And actors!  Etc.  But I do maintain there is something different and, yes, special about the vulnerability required by RPGs.  And, if we're going to compare it to other activities, it's more like other performing arts, or yes, sports, than more "normal" forms of socialization where nothing is at stake.  I really like that point about just putting a bunch of people in a room, giving them alchohol, and telling them to have fun: it's usually boring as hell.<br/><br/>Regarding those tables of RPGA players at trad cons: They're pretty much playing a boardgame, in my experience (and yes, I have done it).  Remember that thread where Luke defined roleplaying in terms of advocacy for a character and ethical choices?  Yeah, there's none of that happening in RPGA modules.

(Yay, Latin roots.)  But as an example of something raised here as the power of vulnerability, let's take the sex rules in Apocalypse World.  I might have to play a courtship scene or a foreplay scene with a character who is not of the gender I myself am oriented towards!  Um, yeah, I've been doing that in RPGs since I was 14 and figured out that I *had* an orientation, and it wasn't the conventional one.  I can understand that for some people, that might be scary and transgressive -- I mean, I'm sure if you searched rpg.net, you could find at least one ongoing thread about how terrible cross-gender play is, since that's a perpetual flamewar -- but for me, it's old hat, so it's extremely unlikely that I'll be *hurt* by even a terrible reaction to it.<br/><br/>And Matt: Even if I accept Luke's definition of roleplaying (which I don't, really, but I'll ignore that), there's definitely character advocacy going on at those tables, and there are ethical choices -- it's just a foregone conclusion that they'll be decided in certain ways, because of the stylization.  <br/><br/>A lot of this sounds like story-gamer exceptionalism: the idea that what we do is so special that it is completely unlike what other people do.  I don't buy that for a second, and it really makes me uncomfortable to define "roleplaying" in a way that excludes the majority of people who call what they do "roleplaying," or to claim that the amazing results you can get when you allow yourself to try things that might go over poorly or be mocked in a roleplaying game are somehow qualitatively different than the amazing results you can get when you allow yourself to try things that might go over poorly or be mocked in a baseball game or musical jam session.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284206/#Comment_284206" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T16:38:53+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  4:38PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2010 4:39PM by Brian_Minter.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think we are doing that thing where we all talk about MOSTLY the same thing, but maybe not QUITE the same thing.

The game I referenced as an example in my first thread was basic old-school-as-it-gets dungeon adventuring. Like I said above, I think this applies pretty equally to all RPGs.<br/><br/>But I do think role-playing itself is pretty special, in terms of a leisure pursuit people do. (Special, not unique).<br/><br/>There's a lot of analogies in this thread, not all of which I think are totally valid. Sports, for example, is different from RPGs in so many ways that I think the comparison is not useful. I say this not as a basement-dwelling hater of "jocks" (I am a former wrestler and track runner and the son of a gym teacher/coach). There are all kinds of ways in which athletics require a lot of you, but the specific kind of social vulnerability that I *think* Matt's thread is about doesn't seem like one of them.<br/><br/>Music is more relevant. And I think that there's a similar dynamic there. If I sit down to jam with friends, I will be pretty secure, even if I'm not the most skilled at improvisation. But if I sit down with strangers, I will definitely be nervous, and I will need to let myself be vulnerable in order to really get into the activity and appreciate what I'm doing.<br/><br/>But I think this example strengthens the point, rather than weakening it. Because creating music with people - group invention and performance for the sheer pleasure of it - is kind of similar to role-playing. And it's also pretty rare. Most people do not sit around after work playing music with friends for fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284207/#Comment_284207" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-03T16:59:06+00:00" title="August  3, 2010  4:59PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 3, 2010 5:01PM by Mcdaldno.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: cwilbur</cite><br/>A lot of this sounds like story-gamer exceptionalism: the idea that what we do is so special that it is completely unlike what other people do.

I think if we both used the same definition, we'd be in agreement.  There's not much to be gained by hashing that one out in more detail; I think we just need to accept that we have that difference.  <br/><br/>And as far as the different qualities go -- that I think we have a more fundamental difference on.  I don't think the qualitative experience of being judged for your performance really differs that much.  I think the reaction differs depending on how much of your self you have invested in whatever it is.  If you have a lot of yourself invested in being a great musician and very little in being a good softball player, you are going to experience judgments based on your musical performance quite differently than judgments based on your softball performance.  The difference, though, is not in the skills that are involved but in the investment of the performer in those skills.<br/><br/>Matt, I understand what you're trying to say quite well.  I just don't agree with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
