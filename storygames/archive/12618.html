It's a lot of fun, but I'd love to see the game go more serious, where there's just limited comedy, mostly situational, and it doesn't start to feel like a game of Toon.<br/>\n<br/>\nDoes anybody have any tips for how to make that happen?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283505/#Comment_283505" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T11:01:18+00:00" title="July 29, 2010 11:01AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.  Since there's really nothing guiding play except the elements (there's no "you have to play like this") it's all reliant on the players.<br/><br/>Often, when people are set free on a game with very little distinct behaviour control, they'll get a little goofy and gonzo.  I've seen games of Penny for My Thoughts or Inspectres go this way. <br/><br/>You can control it by having a conversation about it before you play.  Talk to the people you're playing.  Make sure they're all on board with the humor being dark, not silly.  Also, play with people you are comfortable saying "try it another way" to, you know?  To be able to say "that doesn't sound quite right, maybe let's try something else?" and not worry they'll take it personally.<br/><br/>I empathize completely.  I hate silly in my RPGs.  A lot.

Once you've seen how it works and what authority you have, repeated play tends to get more subtle and refined if your tastes run that way.<br/><br/>So if you've only played once, or are new to the format, that silliness may be an artifact of its newness - silly is easy, and when you've got a lot of new stuff to think about, easy is welcome.<br/><br/>Don't be afraid to be intentional - a few words at the top tends to stop this, if what the whole table is after is something particular. Poll the table, see what the mood is, and then ask people to choose elements that will reinforce that. If you want violent and ugly, choose things that point in that direction. If you want melancholy, same. It isn't a guarantee but it can help set the tone a lot.<br/><br/>I know Fiasco is very capable of a wide range of tones, from shooting drug dealers inside a tornado to the quiet sadness of the one you let get away.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283517">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283517/#Comment_283517" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T11:36:46+00:00" title="July 29, 2010 11:36AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I find that when a game is new to players and when there's a lot of collaboration required, things often take a turn towards silly humor.  I'm not entirely sure why this is, but I'm betting it has something to do with the immediately rewarding feedback you get when you make other people laugh, combined with how people tend to try to lighten the mood when they're uneasy.  Plop 'em down in a game where they're not entirely sure what the fuck they're doing or what anyone else is doing or what kinds of ideas will get traction, and out come the murdered penguins and other goofy stuff.  People don't seem to put out serious material they care about unless they already know it'll work in the game and with the other players, and that's hard to achieve in a first session with a new system, or even a first session with people who know the system but have never played together before.<br/><br/>Getting to a less over-the-top game session that still manages to entertain everyone is probably going to require getting everyone more familiar and comfortable with the system, and then doing exactly what everyone else has already said above:  getting agreement about what tone you want to aim for.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283526">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon" title="lordgoon"><img alt="lordgoon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lordgoon">lordgoon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283526/#Comment_283526" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-29T12:00:16+00:00" title="July 29, 2010 12:00PM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In all of the games I've run, the players I've taught the game to (many of whom were  utterly new to GM-less play) have impressed me by injecting just the right amount of silliness into the game. There'll be maybe one penguin murder, drunken horse or gratuitous fart joke, bu there'll also be plenty of the darker side of the Coen-ish universe. I do think it'd be a mistake to try and totally purge a game of silliness - the dominant theme, after all, is people with horrifically fucked-up lives, and silly things really do happen to such people with astonishing regularity.<br/><br/>In this connection, one thing I did notice at my last session is that one has to be a tad careful with one's table-talk while playing the game. A woman I know (who was doing a fantastic job performing the role of a knocked-up, fifteen-year-old Alaskan Inuit Pole Vaulter with a contract out on her life) turned out to herself have been pregnant before she was married and thrice-divorced to boot. About halfway through the session, she suddenly sort of lost her sense of humor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver" title="DInDenver"><img alt="DInDenver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/510/nMDKSOO3KDKEF.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DInDenver">DInDenver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283809/#Comment_283809" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-31T08:51:45+00:00" title="July 31, 2010  8:51AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jamie,<br/>\n  I was going to agree with Jason, but, when we played there was a bit of silliness.

Specifically: "Water pistol that looks like a real gun" and "Relationship:Odd:Socialism" The rest of the entries we rolled from the Gangster London Playset were appropriate for the feel of those kind of stories.
