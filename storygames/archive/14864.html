For example, I love it when in response to a miss the GM gets to say "Right, cool.  So you've never been to this village before in your life, right?  Why is it that the sheriff hates you so much?"  Or whatever.<br/><br/>Basically, I'm talking about games where the conflict is driven by player failure, which is set up to occur often enough that the story stays interesting.  Character failure is probably less frequent, as exemplified by, say, off screen moves in AW/DW, and GM discretion for how hard and direct a move to make.<br/><br/>Burning Wheel is almost in this category, because the probability of failure on a roll is generally pretty high (there's incentive for setting yourself up on the brink of failure all the time), and the consequence is not intended to be "okay, that doesn't happen, what will you do instead", unless that's somehow an interesting outcome.  The main barrier I see for BW is that the GM rolls for, say, contested tests.<br/><br/>So, a couple of questions, here, moving in various directions:<br/><br/>1) Is it feasible to play Burning Wheel with a diceless-GM, or does that just fundamentally break the system?<br/><br/>2) What games use systems that have, or at least readily allow for, this feel of "dice failure is frequent, irrespective of actual character action failure per se" and "GM rarely or never rolls dice" and so on?  Or to put it another way, which games support the implied GM style of Vincent Baker without bending to the breaking point?  Obviously "anything written by Vincent", and then Lady Blackbird, and more or less "anything by Luke Crane".  What else?  In particular I'm looking for other *systems*.  But exemplars are interesting, too.<br/><br/>3) Has anybody tried to run, say, nWoD games this way?  4e?  Other games that don't at first blush fit the mold?  I don't mean the fluff, here, I mean the system.  So this would mean for nWoD you're still rolling d10s and counting 8+, but with maybe some changes to invite more frequent roll failure, allow the GM to bypass rolling, etc<br/><br/>I realize this is a tad stream-of-consciousness, but hopefully the basic intent of my question is clear enough to spur discussion.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_337949">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337949/#Comment_337949" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T00:01:04+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 12:01AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 10, 2011 12:02AM by JDCorley.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Buffy/Angel iteration of Unisystem games only had GMs roll for big bad guys, never for anything or anyone else.<br/><br/>I am not quite sure what you're asking about with respect to the frequency of failure?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337955">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337955/#Comment_337955" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T00:58:53+00:00" title="August 10, 2011 12:58AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I pretty much play this way.

The trick (for me) was in the fronts and threats. The conflict is driven by the difference in goals of the PCs and the Threats. The story is driven by the repercussions of the character's actions and choices.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe biggest thing that the AW results make crystal clear is that "if you try X, something WILL happen". In a lot of other games all that failing a roll means is that "nothing" happened. An example might be "I try to convince the guard to let me in". If you get a great success you get in. If you get a partial success (7-9, of difficult+3 success in my system), then you either get past and the guard phones in the event (alerts the others) or you are not allowed in but the guard doesn't mention it to anyone, or maybe you get in but the guard himself is alerted and running for help.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you fail, it doesn't mean "the guard just says no". There have to be repercussions - whats the worst that can believably happen in the fiction because of a failed attempt to bribe/pursuade you way past?<br/>\n<br/>\nThat sort of attitude, that there are ALWAYS repercussions and that something always happens, is important. :)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_337971">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad" title="Caesar Slaad"><img alt="Caesar Slaad" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar%20Slaad">Caesar Slaad</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/337971/#Comment_337971" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-10T04:19:49+00:00" title="August 10, 2011  4:19AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Danger Patrol and ICONs are two example.
