Each game is played differently, and all of the games are designed to be easy to learn, but hard to forget. The games draw inspiration from a number of sources, including role playing games, board games, card games, and improvisational theater. The mechanics have been carefully chosen to compliment each game\u2019s subject matter.</blockquote>\nSome of you may remember <i>The Misery Index</i> from our Kickstarter last year.
