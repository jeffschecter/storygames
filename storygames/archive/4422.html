Overall a good experience.  First thoughts:<br/><br/>We wound up with a Nobody developing a Soul's Desire and protagonizing in the same scene.  Specifically, Vitya, the son of Galena, our chief victim, who'd been in several scenes because Galena (as lone victim for a while) appeared frequently, and it was natural for her son to show up too.  So, we got in the habit of torturing Galena for a few power and then trying to seduce Vitya over to our brand of the dark side.  Which was increasingly mechanically unlikely, since his purpose kept going up.  Late in the game, Colin's character Pyotr, as my underling, got framed into a scene with a victim, specifically the now agency 3 Galena.  Before trying to elevate Vitya, he gave him the Soul's Desire "Will I ever see my mother again?" (after having stranded her in the catacombs under Paris).  (And there's something really cool there: by presenting a question that can't be easily resolved, Colin separated these two NPCs that were always showing up together.)  <br/><br/>So, facing 6 dice with his 3 for elevating Vitya, Colin game him an agency of 2, and lost to both pools.  Vitya, who had made a career out of resisting the seduction of evil, turned to Pyotr and told him that he pitied us all, but most of all him, turned his back and walked out of the story.  Solid stuff, and un-forced, which was pretty awesome.<br/><br/>We didn't create any Soul's Desires that were open ended, all binary questions.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the final encounter with Epoctha, the all-beast wasn't as satisfying.  There was precious little stopping any of us from confronting him immediately when we reached Anathema, and it really was a mistake for me not to.  Josh wound up going against him when none of us how Power to burn against him, rolled 4 clarity to no resistance and won.  On reflection, we all realized that only I was in a position to hold off, since I had a shot at winning, but not the current wherewithal to succeed.  Colin had a small chance, but no prospect of improving them, and expressed that he'd go as soon as he could in order to spoil our chances.  <br/><br/>I think we all agreed we'd like to see the endgame expanded.   At the bare minimum, a failed tilt at Epoctha should probably result in Epoctha recognizing that the rest of the Onset is a threat, and confront them each in turn.  The upshot being that it doesn't make as much sense for the underdog to just end the game, since that puts the other players in a position to just win.<br/><br/>We also felt like the roll against Epoctha (Clarity v. Resistance) was too easy, since we'd discovered near the beginning of the second session that the strongest strategic play you have is to reduce your resistance to zero.  And that's strong enough to be a universal first priority.  Perhaps Epoctha's Clarity is equal to yours, or one higher than the best Clarity in play?  And the roll is Aspect v Clarity?  Or each Aspect in turn?  (Which goes into the feeling of wanting the Last Battle to be a little more protracted.)<br/><br/>We recognized two strategic outliers.  The first is the player who goes into Iniquity with zero Underlings, since now he has to fetishize to even have a chance at producing more underlings (and at one die).  He's not out of the game, just utterly, painfully hamstrung.<br/><br/>The second is a starting character that looks like: Clarity: 4, Imagination: 4, Ambition: 5.  We didn't actually try it, but I think that character might have such an early game (and indeed: whole game) advantage as to be the obvious initial stat distribution.  The only thing that stops him is the GM forcing non-imagination aspecting on scenes, and that might be rough to make plausible.  He starts by requesting a scene with a Rival, rolling 4 dice once for a point of Aspect and then reducing to Underling.  Next, Rival again, and keep building aspect until you dump denial into resistance.  Switch to Underling to Reduce resistance to 0.  Rivals for Aspect until you transcend.  Try to Reduce your Rivals rather than lose Resolution to them.  Feel free to throw draw in Nobodies for Power, since you're rolling 9 dice out of the gate.  Reducing those Nobodies into Victims isn't too bad, either, and it's worth reducing a high-purpose nobody if only to be ready to jack your Rage up.<br/>(Alternatively, 5/5/3, or even 6/6/1, with the idea that you'll mostly get power from victims, and you can move NPCs around their states really easily).<br/><br/>We had a couple of aesthetic criticisms: that the color was awfully loose unless you had a reason to be angling for a particular aspect, and because of the transcendence requirements, you spend a lot of time with equivalent aspects.  Plus, some of the aspects serve as more of a constraint than others - Imagination was really easy to work in, and we used Voice a lot as "command," but Flesh and Memory were trickier, and so more interesting.<br/><br/>Second, we felt really powerless as players, since we couldn't have scenes that involved particular characters.  We discussed the idea of a mechanic whereby, once per scene, you could pay 1 Power to introduce any character of your choice into a scene.  Essentially, you call for the character, the GM introduces them.<br/><br/>As to the Aspects and color thing, it occurred to me that if there were mechanics that required the values of the Aspect to be different, and for the high aspect to move around (some sort of leapfrogging maybe, or levels that leak over to other aspects?) you might find more interesting constraint in narrating to aspect.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_99927">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/99927/#Comment_99927" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-29T07:48:50+00:00" title="September 29, 2007  7:48AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow. <br/><br/>*sigh* I gotta get a group together that can play this game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100071">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100071/#Comment_100071" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-30T22:39:53+00:00" title="September 30, 2007 10:39PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My big take-away is that I wanted to be able, once per scene, to spend one power to keep a scene going after a failed roll.

The three players reached anathema within a round or two of eachother. we had our first case of a player reducing another pc to an underling: Colin's character was (or posed as)  the golem seeking to lure forth rabbinical secrets when judson's character seized him and by draw him away from the ghetto, and earth itself, was able to gain control. <br/><br/>As judson describes, we also had our first closure of a soul question/ protaganization of an npc. <br/><br/>For her successful challenge to ephactha, josh's character  visited the primordial oceans where the god feasted and was pursued by one of its pseudopods into a vortex that transported the entirety of ephactha into interstellar space; the god kept devouring (star systems rather than unicellular life) until josh's character shaped galaxies into missiles and shredded it. <br/><br/>A few gm comments. I used the random chart to determine scene's setting and transgression more in the first and third sessions (probably 80-90 percent vs. 20-30 percent in the 2nd session), and liked the random inspiration. <br/><br/>The problem of my not calling for conflicts when the players wanted them for strategic reasons was much less of an issue as the game progressed. I basically just started being more aware of what the players were trying to accomplish, sometimes asking them if they want to roll now. <br/><br/>I continued to enjoy framing the scenes focused on npcs. My framing was looser than encouraged by the book. During the first session, I would usually end the framing with the pc revealed as a shadowy figure entering the scene so that the players could take over from there. By the 2nd and 3rd sessions, the players would sometimes anticipate or put a different spin on where and how and in what form they came into the scene- which was great. For example, in one scene, boris (a proto stalin), was sitting alone in an observatory on the new year's eve that launched the 20th century. I was going to have colin's character burst into the place, but when I described Boris watching the stars through a telescope, josh used concomitance to suggest 'you should be a star' and colin ran with the idea. <br/><br/>by the way we used concomitance more as the game progressed, which was nice<br/><br/>during the 2nd and part of the third sessions I grounded the game more by linking some scenes to important and infamous events and people in russian history. <br/><br/>colins and judson's characters were pretty well defined in our minds by the end of the 1st session; josh's was less clear. At the start of the 3rd session I asked him what kind of scenes would support his vision of the character. One thing he said was that he didn't want the game to be like mage where the occultists had to be secret and never use any powers in ways that normals would notice. I'm not sure if this changed how I framed scenes but it was good to know. <br/><br/>Colin and josh expressed a concern at the end of the game that having characters who weren't designed to be 'cared about,' who were antagonists rather than protagonists, made it hard to enjoy the game consistently. From their perspective, sometimes scenes were enough to hold interest, sometimes figuring out the strategic use of the rules was enough, but not uniformly thoughout a multi session game. We talked about giving characters 3 human features at the start of the game- aspects that players would have to strip from them during the game. For example, maybe you have to rid your self of one before coming scourge and the remaining 2 before becoming anathema- and of course the only way to excise the human element is to give an npc a soul's question related to that element. (And not raise the nobody with the new soul question to underling- nullifying the question- that same scene which the players got very good at doing.<br/><br/>another random thing is that josh (sort of) became his own nemesis because I put him in a scene in a way that suggested his nemesis features. We debated whether this was allowed. I should have used a version of the character against herself to cement this. <br/><br/>Joshua recorded our discussions after the 2nd and 3rd sessions so hopefully he can post it at some point.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_100152">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege" title="PaulCzege"><img alt="PaulCzege" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulCzege">PaulCzege</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/100152/#Comment_100152" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-10-01T08:23:02+00:00" title="October  1, 2007  8:23AM">October 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey Joshua,<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's interesting feedback.

We realized at the end of play that the beginning of the game was powerfully effected by how slow we were to advance.  Josh lucked into a transcendence as his first roll of the game, but Colin and I struggled with resistance for the entire first session, and only transcended at the beginning of the second session.  The beginning of the third session, though, I went from 2/2/2/2 to Scourge in one scene.  Even so, we had scenes where we flubbed the first roll and were done.  I very much resonated with Josh's recommendation of spending power to continue.  Maybe the buyoff of a forced ending is the number of rolls so far?  So that well into a scene, you're more likely to give up rather than spend to continue.<br><br>That mechanic would also help address the taffy-like nature of A:.O:.E:. scenes - you don't have to front load a whole lot of narration, because this roll isn't necessarily gambling an end to the scene.  Which also might overcome a lot of the weird helpless feeling we had.  (We joked that the mechanics were de-antoginizing us.)<br><br>Contrariwise, those mechanics might make me even more wary of Clarity:6, Imagination: 6, Ambition: 1.  Being able to buy more rolls might make that setup really game-breaking.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137718/#Comment_137718" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T13:16:28+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  1:16PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2008 1:22PM by Mike_Holmes.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            {Meant to be whisper}                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_137756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester" title="Judson_Lester"><img alt="Judson_Lester" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://judsonlester.info/initials.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judson_Lester">Judson_Lester</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137756/#Comment_137756" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-02T16:44:40+00:00" title="April  2, 2008  4:44PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 2, 2008 4:46PM by Judson_Lester.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As long as this thread is on the front page again, though: Paul, do you have any responses to all this?

The player need never have a scene with a Nobody or Victim. Do you think it's addressed at all by <a href="http://www.ashcanfront.net/forums/?CommentID=380" rel="nofollow">Carl Congdon's suggested alternate Concours of Terrenes</a> that starts Denial at Clarity minus one for each additional occultist PC in the Terrene? How would you think about addressing it?<br/><br/>In the playtest I'm currently running we haven't had the issue with scenes ending being a problem for narrative flow. Scene-ending rolls are often disappointments to the player, and challenges to player creativity, but when that happens everyone throws out suggestions, and something sticks and gets roleplayed out to wrap the scene.<br/><br/>However, some players have clearly been plagued by repeat failures. I think I need to tinker with the odds of success a just a bit. I wonder if switching so the GM always rolls a d8 would be enough. My gut tells me it's not quite enough.<br/><br/>And regarding anti-climax...I like the idea of making the roll vs. Ephactha a bit tougher. But was there no great drama to your narration of the destructions of the other player characters? I've been thinking the roll vs. Ephactha is just the threshold you cross, with the real drama being the way you work the group, enjoying describing how your minions brutalize and destroy the other characters. Not so?<br/><br/>Thanks,<br/><br/>Paul                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
