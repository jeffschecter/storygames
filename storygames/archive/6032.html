The NPCs the party encounters in the Dungeon is a nice way of getting players who've lost a character back into the game.  Best of all -- it's low level (1-3) and uses the Basic rules (B/X) which is how I like D&amp;D; the best. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\nI've run several different groups of players through this module over the years, and there are still areas none of them have discovered.

We'd maybe get as far as Nulb or the first level of the Temple and then we'd decide that we could've done it <i>better</i> and so we'd end that game there, roll up some new characters and start from Hommlet all over again. Getting it done right was important. Fun at the time, but looking on back on it is was a bonkers way to play <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> We never saw Zuggtmoy, Iuz, or the Nodes.<br/><br/>Also our DM misread the stat blocks for the Earth Elementals in the Earth Temple on the first dungeon level of the Temple. There were at least four Elementals and they were cunningly named A, B, C, D. So when my mate read D=60, he mistakenly read that as DAMAGE = 60 instead of D's hitpoints are 60. The repeated battles we had were insanely difficult as a result, because one hit from these bloody earth elementals instantly killed any on of our 4th-5th level characters.<br/><br/>I should add that we were 11-12 years old at the time <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Cheers<br/>Pete                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135039/#Comment_135039" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-15T08:42:09+00:00" title="March 15, 2008  8:42AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ahh perfect thanks!<br/><br/>We played that using the option of 100th level characters.

One party goes in, dies quick. The second one is generated, goes in, avoids the pitfalls (sometimes literally) that killed the first party, only to die a little later. So you generate another party. This one gets a little further. Maybe even makes it to the lich and then dies. You get the idea.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat's fascinating to me about this is that we at no time questioned that the players were using player knowledge to get further into the dungeon. It's a puzzle for the players to work out. Not the characters... it should kill most characters that come inside, presumably not knowing about the Sphere of Anihillation and such fun stuff, for instance. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis sort of play clearly promotes "Pawn Stance" - playing your character like a pawn in a game, and not considering having it *not* act using knowledge that only you as a player has (to say nothing of characterization, etc). <br/>\n<br/>\nPeople always think that I'm down on these games for this sort of play. I'm not. It's not what I prefer from a TTRPG these days, no. But it was fun then. And it's still fun for me as World of Warcraft now. Tomb of Horrors is simply unrelenting in terms of providing maximum challenge for players. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135256">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135256/#Comment_135256" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-17T15:11:07+00:00" title="March 17, 2008  3:11PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Holmes</cite><br/>Your GM was fudging in your favor.</blockquote>\nDude.

This is from a LJ post I made when they announced Tom Moldvay passed away. \n<blockquote>For those unfamiliar with Moldvay's work, he was responsible for some of Dungeons &amp; Dragons earlier modules, including one of my all-time favorite adventures, "The Isle of Dread."<br/><br/>This module, set on a tropical island filled with monsters and new creatures/races, came with every blue-box expert set, and was one of the first modules I ever played or ran. One of the things I remember most about the setting was the freeform nature of the game. You had this huge island to explore, and it was dangerous to set off without a goal in mind. Many players visited just a small portion of the coastline of  the Isle of Dread, never realizing the crazy things that waited further inland. An entire race of monkey-like creatures that could glide like flying squirrels, massive tar pits, giant spiders and fearsome dinosaur-like creatures were just a few of the hazards that could be encountered.<br/><br/>Speaking of tar pits, the Isle of Dread taught me the valuable practice of map making. A party I controlled once wandered into a huge tar pit, and my inability to tell direction (north, south, east, west) from my brother's description led to the entire group drowning because they continued to venture further and further into the tar rather than trying to escape. <br/><br/>I also remember some of my terror at having to sail to the island. My brother made it a difficult trek, and a huge monster (possibly a Dragon Turtle; my memory fails me) took a good portion of our ship before we made landfall, stranding some of my favorite characters on the isle.<br/><br/>It was a massive, dangerous and fascinating place, all contained within a relatively small adventure module. And I loved it.<br/>Moldvay also was credited with contributing to the Fiend Folio, one of the most fearsome gatherings of monsters in the D&amp;D game, and designing or co-designing several other modules that filled my early D&amp;D days, including "The Lost City,"  "Palace of the Silver Princess" (which introduced my first recurring villain) and "Castle Amber" (again, one of my all-time favorites). Only a few years ago I picked up Moldvay's sequel to Castle Amber, "Mark of Amber," which was part of the then-TSR's audio-enhanced series. I still listen to the CD in my car when I travel.<br/><br/>A lot of these old modules set the tone and feel of D&amp;D, and even roleplaying in general, for a lot of us gamers who grew up in the 1980s. Moldvay's writing especially became the template I used in creating my own adventures, and moments playing through his modules are still among my most treasured gaming memories.<br/></blockquote>\nME                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_135408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/135408/#Comment_135408" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-18T12:34:28+00:00" title="March 18, 2008 12:34PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've never played Isle of Dread, but I'm a big fan of the module just from reading it.
