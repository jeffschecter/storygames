The card-feed work like wonders in such games, shedding the need for a GM and tightening the gameplay in wonderful ways.<br/><br/>I have come to understand that <i>ability-cards</i> and the like are quite common in American live roleplaying games (L-RPGs). I hold this to be due to your larps not being able to free themselves from their ancestors: the verbal rpgss. In Nordic larp the inheritance of the verbal rpgs has been left dead for a decade. The freedom and great development of Nordic larp lies in its ability to exist as a form on its own, playing to its strenghts rather than trying to be tabletop games with costumes. In a Nordic larp the framework is typically based on what the players can act out as is, with their own physical abilities. This means you "restrict" the settings available to history and natural laws as we know them (little magic and lots of realism). You may play vikings, or romantic 1700 nobles, or Victorian age scientists, or WW2-soldiers, or hippies of the 60ties, or punk-youths of the 80ties, or any other setting that lets you dress up and have fun. Then you add relationships and conflicting interests to the brew, and you have a larp that plays out with action that is really ALIVE.<br/><br/>You are free to make great larps due to the fact that you recognize the limitations of the form, and play on the strengths inherent in it.<br/><br/>PS: "V-RPGs" and "L-RPGs" are chosen as terms in the heading only to point to the fact that both these forms are <i>roleplaying games</i>. They are related, but not the same.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164747">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164747/#Comment_164747" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-24T10:10:00+00:00" title="August 24, 2008 10:10AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm.

We are not "bound" by TTRPGs (table-top RPGs)--folks playing games with Tags or Cards and non-physical resolution (I coined it STAT play several years ago; as opposed to the DO play you espouse exclusively) do so because they want to be able to simulate things that are either unsafe (kick someone in the balls) or impossible (run as fast as a car) or socially discouraged (whip out a 3' zweihander in the middle of a crowded nightclub).<br/><br/>But there's quite a bit of DO LARP in the States--like, every single scenario (not Speedball) paintball or Airsoft game. The SCA itself is a very DO LARP, though their tourney style of fighting is a bit rigid and formalized, and they're rather "low plot". My own impending generic LARP system GLASS is all-about DO, in a full-speed, boffer mode... until you have something dangerous, impossible, or too expensive to set/prop/model. Any of those effects, further, can be toggled off, for folks who want 100% DO play (like you line-smashing, down-when-it-feels-right Nords).<br/><br/>But another big issue with STAT play is trust--and we have little for our fellow scheming, cheating-ass bastard players. Relative efficacy is a BIG status thing, in many LARPs; and systems to support and regulate and verify that relative efficacy are a large part of what you see with LARP systems that have Hit Points and Armor Ratings and one-use spell Tags and so forth.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>In a Nordic larp the framework is typically based on what the players can act out as is, with their own physical abilities.

You aren't even "past" us on it. I played my first all-DO "LARP" in about 1983: BB guns and fishing rods, Star Wars theme, running all over our neighborhood. Goggles were required but often forgotten. One-pump maximum (yeah, right...). Them's the rules: GO!<br/><br/>That said, the Nordic scene seems to favor high structure (or high concept) LARP far more than we do in the US--must be the shitty winters driving you batty. Hey, at least that's better than alcoholism and suicide! (I keed, I keed!) <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><i>You are free to make great larps due to the fact that you recognize the limitations of the form, and play on the strengths inherent in it.</i></blockquote>\nAh... but you are imprisoned in limited LARPs because you don't recognize the power of substitution and imagination!<br/><br/>Seriously, though, you aren't really coming down the mountain with much, here. This is an old, OLD point of debate (and rant) at the RPG.net LARP forums, and LARPList. There is no "goodrightfun" in LARP, any more than in RPGs or life. If I want to do a Star Wars LARP, with The Force, or a Tolkien LARP with flinging magic, then I get STATy and only DO the stuff I can do (melee, ranged combat; social conflict; mental puzzles and deduction; etc). I'd go so far as to say GLASS utterly disproves the kernel of your point, in that balances both modes, with a very strong DO leaning (frex, I don't have Flight because it can't be DOne... but I have Ranging, which is what really matters about Flight in a melee fight). I recognize the limits and play on LARP's strengths while also enabling folks who are willing to use their imagination. Chocolate and peanut butter!<br/><br/>And I've been in some really, really great LARPs. Weepy times, boiling rage, sensual fun, inspiring action and words.<br/><br/>About the only things the Nordic Scene has on the US (and elsewhere) are (a) HUGE fan bases, with massive gathers; (b) governmental support, as an art form and historical preservation; and (c) gonzo, out-there experimental shit that would likely lead to lawsuits in this country. I'll give y'all that, for sure! (I can't imagine what an advertised Gang Rape game would draw, in terms of both news and police attention! Well, yes I can, actually; and I don't imagine it being very pretty or easily explained away as consensual and experimental and socially enlightening.)<br/><br/>I'd recommend you head to the RPG.net LARP forum and do some reading. The hackney "Euro v Anglo/Yank" divide is well worn and becoming more and more outmoded every passing month.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
