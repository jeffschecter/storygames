If you don\u2019t feel angst, sadness, frustration, anger, or emotional distress then you have missed the point of play.</i><br/><br/>Cool!<br/><br/>Of course this game is all about "angst, sadness, frustration, anger and emotional distress". So I am not complaining that Davids game is something it is not intended to be. I am also truly thankful to Meguey Baker for giving us this phrase. It is very helpful, for a lot of players, gm's and designers.<br/><br/>But the paragraph in FMA got me thinking. It set up two opposites:<br/><b>- I will not abandon you</b><br/>vs<br/><b>- Nobody gets hurt</b><br/><br/>How about not abandoning players who aims for happiness, love in relationships, strong family-ties, etc. Will they be met with understanding and supportive play, or will they be laughed at for being so naiive?<br/><br/>I'm asking for two reasons:<br/><br/>1 - The "cool" stuff seems to be delving into brutality, cynicism, violence and crime. Why?<br/><br/>2 - I've experienced and seen other become laughingstock for trying to create tender scenes.

If they just go out, search for strong relationships, achieve them without hardship or risk, and enjoy them ... well, I for one sorta hate those people a little.  I don't want to hear their story, much less tell it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat said, I know for a fact that you can get believable and heart-breaking suffering without ever descending into "brutality, cynicism, violence and crime."  I play games in high school settings, and there's plenty of suffering to be wrung from people breaking themselves over the questions of "What does he think of me?  And what would he think if he really knew me?  But if he doesn't really know me then does what he thinks count at all?" and the like.<br/>\n<br/>\nOn your question #2:  I think that creating tender scenes has to come <i>after</i> people care about the characters.  It really does seem sort of silly and contrived before that point:  that's why folks can have a hard time getting into a character-based story (like a TV show) part-way through.  The affection that lets you suspend your awareness of the form doesn't exist for them yet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186411/#Comment_186411" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T17:59:18+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  5:59PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>I don't want to hear their story, much less tell it.</blockquote>No, but playing a role-playing game is not the same as "telling a story" (pardon me for saying this here).\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>I think that creating tender scenes has to come<em>after</em>people care about the characters.</blockquote>Ja, but you havae to care for them in a special way, and be open for tenderness, and have a group around you that makes this feasible.

So... what you describe certainly never happens in my play.<br/><br/>What DOES happen in my play is those tender things can be put at legitimate risk and might get harmed or destroyed.

More than once I've witnessed players introduce some awful things with a sort of haughty puppy demeanor, expecting to be congratulated for being so edgy as to dare introduce paedophilia or some such "mature" topic into the game with no better reason than to prove that they could. Seems to be a pretty common reaction to playing a GMless game for some reason. The few times I've questioned the players about this inclination have received explanations that boil down to "I wanted to see how the other players would react to it". I imagine that anybody going to play long-term would grow out of that sort of thing pretty quick.<br/><br/>Otherwise what Tomas describes is an unknown phenomenon to me - games certainly have crises, horror and misery, but it's all legitimate and balanced by the sort of katharsis you'd expect of any sort of drama. Some games are lighter and thus have serene ups and downs, others have more brutal swings.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186421">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186421/#Comment_186421" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-06T18:36:45+00:00" title="January  6, 2009  6:36PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hereby second the question, "What's FMA?"

To have players being romantic idealistic poetic characters all the time is one solution to what I perceive to be a problem in a lot of classical role-playing; the tendency to shy away from any tenderness or romance.<br/><br/>Eero: most classical rpg's may be said to focus on "misery for it's own sake"; Vampire, D&amp;D, Warhammer, etc. The focus of these games are violence, and the players growing up with this focus is the ones most inclined to consider you a "softie" if you propose other themes in your play.<br/><br/>I do know that the slogan "I will not abandon you" is not directed at the typical classical rpg in the first place, but I am of a mind to discuss it in that context. In my view it has as much merit there as anywhere.<br/><br/><i>Mind you: I do not blame Warhammer for having a violent focus, or players for playing up on it. None of these games are at fault for doing what they do. None are at fault for this. It is just a phenomenon with consequences. We as a community are cheated and left with less than we could have had, due to this being such a predominant phenomenon in our gaming.</i><br/><br/>What i am talking about is how the predominance of violence in games lead some/many* players to abandon each other in scenes of more tender qualities. This problem has been with me in one form or other since the 80s, when I made the naive, poetic rpg <i>Muu </i>in answer to it. Even though much have changed since then, most is still the same for the majority of players. The predominance of games like D&amp;D and Vampire gives the typical players little leeway from harsh brutality. They are "educated" to play up on cynisism, brutality and violence. In my view this manifest in abandonment (amongst other things) towards players that dare to introduce anything soft and serious in these game-groups.<br/><br/><i>* how widespread this problem is, is of course something we may disagree on. We really have no way of knowing without proper staticstical analysis. So we may leave that debate dead. Let us for the sake of discussion accept that the problem is real, and look for explanations and/or solutions.</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186449">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Pete" title="Pete"><img alt="Pete" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Pete">Pete</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186449/#Comment_186449" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T01:09:57+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  1:09AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 1:12AM by Pete.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: GB Steve</cite>What's FMA? </blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Roby</cite>I hereby second the question, "What's FMA?"

In some situations I propose (and have experienced) that this reluctance translate into abandonment of the player in question. That is: the player is met with possible hurtful and cynical reactions not warranted by the initiative itself.<br><br><i><b>Possible line of play:</b> Roger plays a warrior in a fantasy rpg. He visits his hometown and seeks up his mum. He initiates a really tender moment in his approach to the scene, and the GM introduces his brutal father to end the "dangerous" tendency, to the cheers of the other players. Roger had not realized up until this point that he has really missed such opportunities in this "you may do anything"-game, and are really surprised by the hurt he feels over being "snubbed" like this.</i><br><br>Of course we may explain this as a bunch of young men with brutal behavior, but there is always the possibility that they are educated by the game to react this way. At last we may observe that in our subculture the opposite is much more rare; that a player is snubbed due to him choosing a brutal/cynical/violent approach to the scenes. If, for instance, a player where to play the character meeting his mother in a cynical way, it may well be cheered as \xfcber-cool by the same group. Again: this may be due to the group being immature, but I have a suspicion it is as much induced by the game itself.<br/><br/>My claim is that the dominating consensus of a brutal/cynical/violent narrative in the most popular games, leads to a lot of abandonment of players who wish to express other sensibilities in their characters. Players are susceptible to the games they are playing. The principles for our immersion in the interactive system is laid in the game-rules, and as such I believe it will influence the social behavior of immature players around the table.<br/><br/>This would have been less of a problem if the brutal/cynical/violent-games where not so dominant. If the field where softened by popular games with other themes, even the gamers in the brutal games would be less inclined to abandon a fellow player on such grounds. It would help players to accept that indeed any notion or initiative may be fruitful in a role-playing game, if treated with respect.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186463">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186463/#Comment_186463" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T04:06:44+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  4:06AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 5:17AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Kaare Berg</cite>Do not conflate "misery for its own sake" and conflict as a narrative tool.</blockquote>I don't.<br/><br/>I said that most classical rpg's may be said to focus on "misery for it's own sake"; Vampire, D&amp;D, Warhammer, etc. The focus of these games are violence, and the violence are seldom justified by any higher goal (treasures are certainly not a higher goal, and neither is killing on racial grounds). This is violence as entertainment. We play this games to have fun slaughtering monsters. Close enough to "misery for it's own sake", in my view.<br/><br/>I am not against it as such, but I resent the fact that it is so <i>dominating</i>, both in the games we play and in the way a lot of players think on rpgs. Such dominance has consequences, one of which I am proposing for us to explore in this thread.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186465">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186465/#Comment_186465" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T04:18:30+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  4:18AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, Meg's probably got a lot of insight into this  Happily she's not some cloud-dwelling robot, but she doesn't hang out here, as far as I know.

It has taken me a good 20 years to reach this insight, so I don't consider it "simple". <i>A hard won insight</i> would be a better description, in my view.<br><br>I would love to give you actual play, but the example already given is the closest I come. I've experienced situations very much like the one I describe, and have had similar and different situations described to me. Sometimes the emerging issues of conflicting player-interests do collide like this, in various ways (depending on the game and people).<br/><br/>Still: more often they give raise to a general uneasiness, an uneasiness that often lead to some player dropping out of role-playing altogether. Or worst case scenario: they keep playing, but find no fun in it anymore.<br/><br/>And further: I do know that some groups manage to resolve such conflicts  in a constructive and/or amiable manner.<br/><br/>It is typical for such conflicts to arise in young game-groups in the late teens and the early twenties, I would say. These are people growing into adulthood, with a lot of issues emerging due to that. My claim is that there is abandonment going on due to the nature of most role-playing games, a nature that feeds into players being cool and cynical in attitude, at least during their game-play.<br/><br/>I have a great respect for role-playing games. I have seen players laugh themselves silly, seen them cry in sorrow and attack each other in anger, and I've seen a player so taken with a rpg that he repeatedly banged his head against a window-pane with such force that I seriously expected him to break it (head or window). So it is obvious to me that these games we play may claim part of our heart and soul  ...<br/><br/>I believe the games we play affect us, as individuals and as groups, so I try to think aloud here, around the idea that my experience on how players are abandoned when aiming for tenderness is due to the games played.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186479">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186479/#Comment_186479" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T06:12:40+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  6:12AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2009 6:14AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Meg!

The discomfort some folks feel in the face of tender emotions is just as real as that felt by others in the face of explicit gore and mental violence. A commitment to IWAY play ought to also cover this ground, to agree not to give in to nervous giggling and diffusing comments when something emotionally vulnerable is happening. <br/><br/>As designers and GMs, we can offer a lot of support for this kind of play simply by actively looking for opportunities for the PCs to engage in this way, and then listening really carefully if they do. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>Back to initial questions:<br/>1- Why is "cool" so knitted together with "the dark side" in our rpg-culture?<br/>2- Have we inherited it from other popular-cultural phenomenons?<br/>3- Is this really where the strengths of dialogue-based role-playing lies?<br/>4- Are there more joyful and tender themes which have as great a potential (or greater) for exciting game-play?</blockquote>\n1 - I suggest that it has roots in two things: one, the adolescent desire (male and female) to explore the dark sides of one's own psyche and impulses, and two, the human experience of a compelling story having trial and strife to cast success and harmony in a stronger light.<br/>2 - I don't think so. I think the act of story-telling, from the earliest cave paintings to the most recent down-loadable whatever, contains this examination of what is painful, grotesque, and frightening.<br/>3 - No. And that needs expanding, probably.<br/>4 - Absolutely. However, if it's an uninterrupted waltz through a field of bunnies and rainbows, it's going to be pretty dull for a sophisticated audience, which requires more texture and subtly. Perfect for a toddler, though. Seriously, sometimes everyone wants to succeed, to win peace for their people, to catch the bad guy, to reconcile with our parents, to find true love. If we never get to do those things, our games feel flat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186484">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186484/#Comment_186484" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T06:45:59+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  6:45AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You've got a lot of strong cultural forces working against genuine emotional engagement with games... especially vulnerable/"soft" emotion.<br/><br/>1. RPG culture is overwhelmingly masculine, so you have gender constructions that don't permit expression of emotions<br/>2. RPG players are often young adults or adolescents, so emotional expression is often difficult due to a limited palette of experiences<br/>3. RPG play groups are rarely durable, robust social environments in which there is or can be an expectation of emotional support and "safe space"<br/>4. Related to 3, one of the most common social contract elements that evolves in lasting groups is a variation on "no politics, no religion, nothing controversial or emotional"<br/>5. Fiction-making in RPGs tends to work best when it's not subtle or nuanced. Fiction construction relies on tropes and cliche, and thus it can be difficult to present genuine emotional content without it looking forced or fake.<br/><br/>I've always felt that "I Will Not Abandon You" works best as an explicit commitment made by a group of players, rather than a broad aesthetic, design principle, or manifesto. It may be that certain games only work well when that commitment is made, though, just as there are others where it is actively destructive.<br/><br/>Emotion is hard to communicate in art in general. Representation is easier. The risk of failure and misunderstanding is much more personal and much more severe when working with content that is meaningful and resonant to players on a real-world level than it is when playing with genre trappings and flash-bang-smash.

RPG culture is overwhelmingly masculine, so you have gender constructions that don't permit expression of emotions<br/>2. RPG players are often young adults or adolescents, so emotional expression is often difficult due to a limited palette of experiences<br/>3. RPG play groups are rarely durable, robust social environments in which there is or can be an expectation of emotional support and "safe space"<br/>4. Related to 3, one of the most common social contract elements that evolves in lasting groups is a variation on "no politics, no religion, nothing controversial or emotional"<br/>5. Fiction-making in RPGs tends to work best when it's not subtle or nuanced. Fiction construction relies on tropes and cliche, and thus it can be difficult to present genuine emotional content without it looking forced or fake.<br/></blockquote>\nI'll add another item to the list :<br/>6. Sociology researchers (I tried to find a link to some source, maybe I'll be luckier later) has investigated the link between thoughts about one's own death and violence. And there seems to be strong evidences that, to some individuals, being confronted with their own mortality triggers violent reactions. Then a game that threatens PCs with the risk of death frequently might induce violent behaviors from players (IC or OOC I don't know) more so than a more "peaceful" game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186578">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186578/#Comment_186578" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:39:50+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:39AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi, folks; I wish I'd gotten here sooner (you Euros need to switch to US time and start posting late night!). <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>First, the game link directly to FMA is here: <a href="http://davidartman.com/games/for-mature-audiences" rel="nofollow">http://davidartman.com/games/for-mature-audiences</a>.<br/><br/>To clarify one thing about the game (for what it's worth) that folks might need to realize for MY treatment of IWNAY: you are, in effect, playing yourself. Your "PC" is an idealized representation of what you want to be, envisioned in a plush doll or stuffed animal or similar. Your "angst and pain" will come in because you Scar this cute ideal with a Sharpie pen, drawing what look like tattoos that symbolize the real-life issue(s) with which you want to struggle in the narrative. Mechanically, those are the points where your Plushie is stabbed with a knitting needle to be introduced into a scene (and from which stuffing is ripped by a crochet hook, to represent the Damage of disengaging from a scene with the issue unresolved--you gotta pick at the scab SOME, or it gets ripped open by someone else).<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't want to derail the real thread point (to which I reply below), but I think recognizing the intentional push on players to prod what hurts and shames them most is KEY to recognizing how seriously I take IWNAY as The Prime Directive of the game (I repeat it ad nauseum, according to one reviewer). But does that mean FMA is all and only angst and pain. Fuck no, not if it's played fully. Quite the opposite: I imagine moments of serious empathy, sorrow for others, joy at seeing someone break through a painful issue and become stronger--all KINDS of hippie, softtie, crying jag stuff (I get a bit misty just writing about it here). If all one does in FMA is grind and gripe and face-stab, one is totally missing the point and, frankly, being abusive, regardless of the IWNAY Prime Directive. It's a valley, not a plateau: you slide and fall and sometimes trudge down IN ORDER TO get through it, climb out, and stand taller at the other side; you don't crest to some height of masochism and see how long you can hold that feeling in the thin air.<br/><br/><br/>Second, Meguey's article is quoted <i>in toto</i> (with some... edits... for clarity), with her permission, in the aforementioned sidebar. Of course, direct discussion of it in context as a standalone article could well be done via comments to her blog. But, LO, here she is. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>My understanding (and how I use it in FMA) is that IWNAY is a social contract, an agreement between players that lines WILL be crossed, veils WILL be pulled back, and yet no one will back off emotionally or react with stigma and judgment to other's doing so. Conversely, NOGH play is when you have those lines and veils conversations prior to play and, nope, no one will cross them or unveil them and, thus, no one gets hurt by having their noses rubbed in something they abhor (and can justly leave or react with righteous judgment when that happens). To directly answer Thomas's first line of inquiry: if you're playing IWNAY, you DO NOT GET ABANDONED, period, no matter whether you're raping puppies or composing an impromptu ode to the beauty of an NPC beau (or another PC!). And, conversely, the freedom to push, by others, doesn't equate to the freedom to be abusive: to mock is to abandon, in my opinion, because it perforce requires a "me versus you" stance, so I can start pointing my cruel fingers at your soft underbelly.<br/><br/>But neither is a One True Way, nor a manifesto, nor a design element (excepting in my own usage of IWNAY as the keystone to support the rest of play). ANY game can be played IWNAY or NOGH (except FMA and others of similar seriousness and intentional risk-taking), even though most games are played NOGH by tradition or due to the players being strangers or due to one or two assholes who can't tolerate being pushed at all (the second is what makes con games rather staid; the first and third are what typically prevent local groups from pushing the envelope). We've had Lines and Veils discussions prior to playing DitV, for goodness sake--is there any game which has as much in the rules about pushing players' actual morals and beliefs, through conflicts and the mechanics of escalation? But, yep, we had the L&amp;V talk:I said no child rape--softie that I am--and, of course, the GM threatened children in every way possible OTTHER than such horror, because I showed him the doorway to pushing me. Had we gone IWNAY, he coulda thrown me right into an Urutsigadoji-on-kids scene and I'd have had to stay in it (shooting the shit out of everything in sight, probably) and not abandon him. (There's some AP to come down from theory clouds.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186579">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186579/#Comment_186579" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T10:40:14+00:00" title="January  7, 2009 10:40AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Third, I agree with Meguey that the proclivity in gaming (and stories) is to circle around then finally engage in CONFLICT, and conflict is typically recognized when (in fiction) a character is hurt, attacked, denied, shunned. The resolution of conflict could well be the "softie" results that folks seem to find so rare (me, not so much--a LOT of my adult play has explored love, commitment, honor, joy). But the coda is never the climax, and an intrinsically negative conflict source has an intrinsically negative climax. It's rare that the violent villain is "talked down" from his doomsday device by his loving mother or wife. He's shot down by the rugged hero (who then gets the loving girl and a nice smooch--there's yer LOVE and JOY, wimp! In the coda.).<br/><br/>But, no, I do not agree whatsoever that softie play is not possible in RPGs. Now, many RPGs don't seem to encourage it with tone or mechanics; others do quite a bit (see "Ardor" in Pendragon). I'd even argue that FMA is MUCH more about the loving results, but only because trusting and loyal friends gather to help each other to that place, by exposing and (hopefully) purging things which bring them significant sorrow. If you don't love your fellow players in FMA, you're going to be VERY hard pressed not to abandon them at some trying point. This is all to say, yet again, that the game text and artifact will set the tone and point of play; and drifting amongst NOGH players is done at one's own risk. We sit down to play Champions, the book has already "programmed" us for biff-bam-boom action... and then here you come wanting to have a smooch scene or cry on my cape about how your father's coldness pushed you into crime fighting? Dude, Seg Twelve!<br/><br/><br/>Finally, to catch up to the drift of the thread, I think the adolescent desire to explore the dark is part and parcel with their difficulty expressing emotions (I, for one, don't think that's male-exclusive, though females have different means of learning how to do so, and do so quicker). Look at the transitions these poor fuckers have to go through:<br/>* They no longer can cry and moan if some minor slight occurs--that's been stigmatized out of them years earlier. "Stop acting like a baby!"<br/>* And yet, hormonally, they are awash in the most powerful emotions--some of them BRAND NEW--they've ever felt. "Girls are weird!"<br/>* Intergender (of, if you prefer, inter-attractional) relations are going through a complete sea change, literally flipping on their head. "Mmmm... boobies."<br/>* And yet, they're STILL not "old enough" to really get off--to face, address, express, and release these crazy new desires and urges. "Wait until you're older; don't be a slut."<br/><br/>Given that, is it any wonder the poor bastards try to find channels of expression where they can vent and then back off and say, "Oh, it's just a game." Is it any wonder this demographic is what makes most horror flicks profitable? Is it any wonder they don't have the tools to explore a sensitive and mature treatment of themes of love and honor and sharing... hell, even simple sensuality free of raw sexuality? As Mark points out, it's hard enough for adults, so the "representation" is the cheap and quick solution to get through a weekly session of entertaining gaming.<br/><br/>Sure, that's a bit of armchair psychology, but it seems to answer Thomas's queries (in their various permutations) to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186692">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo" title="Daniel Yokomizo"><img alt="Daniel Yokomizo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Daniel%20Yokomizo">Daniel Yokomizo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186692/#Comment_186692" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T16:36:17+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  4:36PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A couple of anecdotes:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Most of my characters (in these 15 or so years of gaming) were pacifists. I managed to even create a pacifist cleric in a D&amp;D campaign and be quite successful. Also I managed to live with a pacifist Garou in a Werewolf the Apocalypse game (this campaign had more than 50 sessions). I got into this because seeing how every other character was so violent got me pissed off. The only game I never managed to write a non-violent character was in CP2020 which lead me to anecdote number 2.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. I know a GM that avoids tender scenes (mainly romance) and if you insist the scene always ends up in betrayal, mockery or comedy (in the fiction, not at the table). Whenever a game included violence he pushed for it very hard, most of the time you could only escape a conflict if you killed the opposition, merely hurting them ensured they would came back with vengeance in their eyes.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. IME most of the players who can't deal with tender scenes also can't deal with sexuality at all, other than as an exercise in ego masturbation.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. IWNAY is great but I see it used to push against issues that hurt much more often than not. In a sense I find it even dysfunctional by itself, as a social contract it doesn't work for tenderness unless the players are sufficiently compassionate and open to feel vulnerable (i.e. a kind of vulnerability that cripples your aggression instead of fueling it). OTOH I try to use IWNAY as a guideline in all my close relationships, I became a better person because of this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186722">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186722/#Comment_186722" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T19:15:30+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  7:15PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I started writing this to be funny but now I'm genuinely curious.<br/><br/>Okay, David, you state in FMA that the opposite of "I will not abandon you" is "Nobody gets hurt." Is that really true? Because it seems to me that the obvious and logical opposite of "I will not abandon you" would be a theoretical "I <i>will</i> abandon you" type of play. And "nobody gets hurt" seems like it's far, far away from "I will abandon you."<br/><br/>Now I'm wondering if there are in fact players out there operating from this sort of perspective? <i>You're on your own! I'm outta here -- don't care if you get hurt or not! </i><br/><br/>You know?<br/><br/>(Although I certainly see the value of viewing the opposite of "nobody gets hurt" as "I'm probably going to hurt you (but I will not abandon you if/when I do).")<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186732">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe" title="Wolfe"><img alt="Wolfe" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://wolvesdenpublishing.com/GoPlayLogo2.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Wolfe">Wolfe</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186732/#Comment_186732" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-07T20:25:52+00:00" title="January  7, 2009  8:25PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I might take a stab at answering that Paul, even though I'm not David.<br/>\n<br/>\nIWNAY and NGH are opposites in a <i>functional</i> spectrum of play.

Fuck that right in the ear. Our group is "no one gets hurt" because we're all Alzheimers, drugs, bloodied children and disease all week long and the last thing we want, the very last thing we would ever want to do in our pretendy game time is to push an emotional envelope. We wouldn't be hurt by it. We'd be annoyed and pissed off. Oh great, THIS shit again. If I wanted to cope with this, I'd go in to work. Just throw a dart at my 110-family caseload and pick a file.<br/><br/>We do love emotional material, though:<br/><br/>"My character feels horrible. His face falls. Tears fill his eyes. He looks out across the desert, consumed with grief. He thinks of his mother, in a happier time from long ago.

It may be tapped into as a ressource, but it has to be respected too, and for some people the tender issues are plainly not fun. I wish for all players to be met with respect at the table. Respect taps into trust.<br/><br/>Role-playing is dependant on players trusting each other. Trust enables acceptance, and acceptance enables listening and supporting, and going into flow with your fellow players.<br/><br/>Jason Corley; It is challenging to be tender or poetic, or to play out romantic ideals deeply set in us. The challenge is not a negative thing, for most people. In my view it is a hell of a lot more entertaining than anything else. To choose not to do that is your prerogative still, Jason. I'm not advocating for all players to do this, or for any players to do it all the time. I'm talking about those that would like to do it, but are left out on a bare limb if they dare. I understand that you react to the contents of this thread, as it may be read as a proposal that ALL MUST DO TENDERNESS. It is not meant so, ok?\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meguey</cite>As designers and GMs, we can offer a lot of support for this kind of play simply by actively looking for opportunities for the PCs to engage in this way, and then listening really carefully if they do.</blockquote>I've been a GM for lots of people out there and have had great fun pushing some tender buttons. In classical rpgs it is seldom expected, and certainly not in convention-games, so I've done it as much as I can. Even a small spark of emotion can ignite inspired game-play.<br/><br/>In my experience the slight discomfort felt by most players <b>*</b> opens them up to an intuitive character-immersion, in most cases, when you offer these scenes in the right way. In some rare cases you quickly understand that it will not be fun for the player, and back off. And in some really rare cases it has been necessary to push a player, on the grounds that "if you have gone so far, I must ensure you go through with it" (a very few of us have made a habit of abandoning themselves).<br/><br/><i><b>*</b> -  yes, I do think most of us feel some discomfort when something of value to us is surfacing in a game. I believe this discomfort positive. We tell ourselves that THIS is something we care about, and must protect, and will close in on with respect and feeling. Most of us will feel a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">positive</span> discomfort when such issues surfaces.</i><br/><br/>As for a solution to the problem we are discussing here, I see the designers of rpgs as essential. As we write more and more games on alternate themes, with alternate dramatic curves and conflicts, the field will open up for all of us. Then choosing a theme and a play-style will become more of a conscious choice, and be out there for all to see (I'm talking the <i>ideal </i>future here, of course). When all themes are valid, and catered for in the games we choose amongst, no one needs to sit on their high horse and look down on the other "idiots" (the triggerhappy idiots, the tenderhappy idiots, the dicehappy idiots, etc.).<br/><br/>I'm proud to say that I have done my share here, in almost every conceivable part of the rpg-spectrum.<br/><br/><b>1- Why is "cool" so knitted together with "the dark side" in our rpg-culture?</b>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meguey</cite>1 - I suggest that it has roots in two things: one, the adolescent desire (male and female) to explore the dark sides of one's own psyche and impulses, and two, the human experience of a compelling story having trial and strife to cast success and harmony in a stronger light.</blockquote>I am not convinced that "the adolescent desire to explore the dark" is not something induced by culture. That is; this desire may not be a natural law. In other times, when children are growing up in another society, we may as well talk about an adolescent desire to explore the trappings of a responsible and empathic adult ...<br/><br/><br/>As for the trial and strife: yes, I do consider this a very solid argument. In age old stories we humans have explored everything that treathens our love and happiness, and with good reason. At the same time we have idolized love and happiness, with equally good reason. In my view the balance is essential, and in the rpg-culture as a whole it is a bit skewed. In the long run it don't have to be, if designers take the challenge and write more games in other parts of the narrative spectrum.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>1. RPG culture is overwhelmingly masculine, so you have gender constructions that don't permit expression of emotions</blockquote>Yes! Gender construction interests me. It is a "magic" of complex and fleeting nature, tapping into almost everyone and everything making up our everyday life as adolescents. Out of this "magic" grows an adult wo/man, more or less equipped to meet the travails and challenges of a grown up. The magic of role-playing games is that they may tap into any conceivable part of this process, and offer practical tools for gender-building. And the magic of it is that role-playing games may be 100% fun while doing it!<br/><br/>I know that masculine gender construction which supports the strength to hold your emotions, are indeed possible. A man may very well teach himself to rule his emotions (and slip out of the emotional shackles placed on men ruled by their emotions). In my view there is no better way of growing the strength for this, than to embrace your emotions with your consciousness and reason. To do this in role-playing games is a highly rewarding practice, as long as the game and the co-players are supportive. We do need games with such aspects!<br/><br/><i>- continues in next post ...</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_186758">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186758/#Comment_186758" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T01:40:06+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  1:40AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 8, 2009 1:40AM by TomasHVM.">edited January 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>2- Have we inherited it from other popular-cultural phenomenons?</b>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meguey</cite>2 - I don't think so.

There is too little of the virtues and the ideals in our role-playing games.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>2. RPG players are often young adults or adolescents, so emotional expression is often difficult due to a limited palette of experiences.</blockquote>I believe you are right, with regards to the limited palette. Still; I've played a lot with children from 10 to 15 and have found them to be eager explorers of the emotional palette in rpgs, if given the chance. So its all about giving young people the chance to educate themselves on emotions, both light and dark, and to play around with them in positive and harmless ways. My youngsters have had lots of benefits from me being a grown-up GM, of course, but they have certainly thrown themselves at the issues. And the issues have paid back to them, both in play and in their personality.<br/><br/>I believe healthy youngsters are explorative and challenging, and that they are THE most malleable players of all. Most of the truth about young role-players is a product of our games and our gaming-culture.<br/><br/>And I do believe we have inherited most of our standards from popular culture. Our origin in fantasy and games has led us as a sub-culture to focus on obvious themes within our popular culture; violence and war (Barbara Cartland is conspicuously absent in role-playing games ... sry, just <span style="text-decoration: underline;">had</span> to say that). This stems from the origin of role-playing games, not from their nature. I believe that role-playing games are as diverse as any other expression in their nature. And I believe it essential that they express the whole range of possible expressions, to function as a healthy and whole alternative to other expressions when it comes to being a social toolbox for younger humans to play around with.<br/><br/>Whatever way you turn this thing called "role-playing games", however much you are into the fun of it, it is in fact a social toolbox for us.

However, if it's an uninterrupted waltz through a field of bunnies and rainbows, it's going to be pretty dull for a sophisticated audience, which requires more texture and subtly. Perfect for a toddler, though. Seriously, sometimes everyone wants to succeed, to win peace for their people, to catch the bad guy, to reconcile with our parents, to find true love. If we never get to do those things, our games feel flat.</blockquote>Waltzing a field of bunnies and rainbow is good for the toddler, yes, and dull for a grown up. But what is in-between there? What does the youngsters get? Is shooting the bunny all the alternative there is for the 14 year old girl?<br/><br/>I'd rather see the 14 year old girl getting emotionally involved with the bunny ... (no, only joking).<br/><br/>There is of course other themes and play-styles to be had for the youngsters of our time, and for grown ups. This is no time for game-smiths to sit back and relax. Go game!\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>4. Related to 3, one of the most common social contract elements that evolves in lasting groups is a variation on "no politics, no religion, nothing controversial or emotional".</blockquote>\nI have the feeling that this "social contract"-thingy is far more common as a spoken contract in your game groups. I have scarcely any experience with any contract being set in stone in any groups I've played with. No players I've played with have ever had the privilege of barring any theme from play, except in games where personal issues was meant to be an explicit and serious foundation for our interaction. In normal play I've yet to see anyone suggesting a "social contract" being set up before play.<br/><br/>Of course; you may talk of this as an implied thing, and as such I can understand it. If this is so I maintain that any such "contract" will be fleeting in nature, and ever prone to negotiation. And said "negotiation" may very well be implied in the blink of an eye when someone trespass on one of your sore-zones, and you let them. Why do you let them? Well ... their offer was such a promise of interesting interaction that you could not refuse. That is all the "negotiation" you need to overcome such preconceptions of what is proper in a role-playing game.<br/><br/>To put it another way: are the "social contract" you talk so much of really worthy the term <span style="text-decoration: underline;">contract</span> at all? could it be that the "contract" is a discussion-ghost, and not a real thing?<br/><br/><div><b>* * *</b></div>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>5.

There is a lot of killing, monster hunting, macho styling, and lack of tenderness. No surprises there. Those male entertainments that don't revolve around killing, such as (again) singing, sports success, and stardom, are again not well represented with RPGs.<br/><br/>So the rather uncontroversial conclusion is that a large majority of RPGs (especially trad ones) are aimed towards, and played by, those boys interested in killing and bashing things, who are also often those interested in rebellion and dark themes (to better shock others). They are also played by girls with the same interests. It doesn't surprise me that such players don't have much time for happiness, love in relationships, strong family-ties, etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186769">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Meguey" title="Meguey"><img alt="Meguey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lumpley.com/megweb/dollz/1001.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Meguey">Meguey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186769/#Comment_186769" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T05:40:46+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  5:40AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few things:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite>My understanding (and how I use it in FMA) is that IWNAY is a social contract, an agreement between players that lines WILL be crossed, veils WILL be pulled back, and yet no one will back off emotionally or react with stigma and judgment to other's doing so. Conversely, NOGH play is when you have those lines and veils conversations prior to play and, nope, no one will cross them or unveil them and, thus, no one gets hurt by having their noses rubbed in something they abhor (and can justly leave or react with righteous judgment when that happens). To directly answer Thomas's first line of inquiry: if you're playing IWNAY, you DO NOT GET ABANDONED, period, no matter whether you're raping puppies or composing an impromptu ode to the beauty of an NPC beau (or another PC!). And, conversely, the freedom to push, by others, doesn't equate to the freedom to be abusive: to mock is to abandon, in my opinion, because it perforce requires a "me versus you" stance, so I can start pointing my cruel fingers at your soft underbelly.</blockquote>\nIf you are able to be explicit enough with the social contract, and then stick to it, then yes, that's a good example of IWNAY. The struggle is to stick to it.<br/><br/>Wolfe's observations of what breaking IWAY can look like\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite><br/>Checking Out: turning your focus elsewhere; surfing the web, flipping through a book, stacking your dice*<br/>Mood-shattering: Cracking a joke or some other way breaking the mood or distracting from the play so that it cannot be engaged in<br/>Protesting: Vocally saying that something isn't acceptable to you; Possibly leaving.<br/>The Dodge: Doing something in the fiction that redirects the scene; Can be preemptive; Sometimes may be uncharacteristic</blockquote>\nmakes it clear, I hope, how hard it is to stick to it. <br/>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><b>1- Why is "cool" so knitted together with "the dark side" in our rpg-culture?</b><br/><cite>Posted By: Meguey</cite>1 - I suggest that it has roots in two things: one, the adolescent desire (male and female) to explore the dark sides of one's own psyche and impulses, and two, the human experience of a compelling story having trial and strife to cast success and harmony in a stronger light.</blockquote>I am not convinced that "the adolescent desire to explore the dark" is not something induced by culture.

And as children mature into adolescence and young adulthood, the monsters may change, but the impulse stays the same. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: JDCorley</cite>Oh great, THIS shit again.

And as children mature into adolescence and young adulthood, the monsters may change, but the impulse stays the same.</blockquote>You are right. Children and young adults do love to explore the dark corners of the world, of course. What I am trying to say is that too much of the dark brooding, especially induced by the products made by grown-ups, are paving the ground for an unhealthy focus in the lives of teenagers and young adults. I suspect that the <i>dominance </i>of "cool" violence amongst young men (primarily) has other causes than only the natural drive. And I believe that a "combat is the only fun"-stance has consequences on the social level.<br/><br/>I do not blame any players for this. I don't blame any players for believing that "combat is the only fun" either. Many players have tried to change their play-style and the focus of their games as they grow up, and have failed abysmally in that. So they flee from rpgs (and tend to view them as a juvenile activity), or they revert to the age-old formula of monster-bashing. As long as there is no alternative to the "juvenile" monster-bashing, players will continue to do that, and many more than necessary will end up in frustration.<br/><br/>Which leads me to this question: how can the new role-playing games purported by you and me make it to the mass-market? How can we, the new designers, be the constructive force supplying players with cool games to take them further, deeper, wider ...<br/><br/>What I am advocating is not <i>banishment </i>of all things dark and mysterious, but <i>balancing </i>it by introducing a bit more of light and luck in our part of the cultural weave.<br/><br/><div><b>* * *</b></div><br/><br/>I opened this thread by describing something I perceive to be a problem for some players, and hinting at a possible answer to why this problem arises.

So I'll weigh in a bit more....\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Wolfe</cite>WNAY and NGH are opposites in a <em>functional</em> spectrum of play. NGH is "I will abandon you if we go there, so let's not go there, okay?"</blockquote>\nThis is right. I think "I WILL abandon you" is just a part of NOGH; it's the stick that will keep others from crossing the established lines and veils.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>At least a few of them seem to genuinely value *using* emotional investment as a strategic tool - "you won't go there, and I will, so I win".</blockquote>\nPretty succinct definition of abuse, seems to me. But, hey, some folks enjoy masochism, so I won't say badwrongfun. Something like the game of chicken, played with emotions. Not my cup of tea, but I'd say mainly because I know I could always win (wanna compare dark sides with ME, bub?) and I don't like being a bully.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>In normal play I've yet to see anyone suggesting a "social contract" being set up before play.</blockquote>\nWell, it's not explicit, and yes it's malleable as a college coach's "contract." Term debate might make an interesting thread, if you'd like to go there (I enjoy nomenclature, and can agree that "contract" is a bit misleading).<br/><br/>However, if we're going to compare anecdotes, I've seen some degree of social contract establishment in every game I've played in my adult life, with (yes) the continuous refinement of same during play. Folks are more than happy to speak up about the dark (or light) things they don't want to address, if not in some formal declaration process.<br/><br/>Some games even codify elements of it into their very setup to play (<i>Universalis</i> springs to mind, with the Tenets phase and examples of Tenets like "no cell phones" or "no Monty python jokes" or what-not). I've had a lines and veils talk with every new group and at con games, when appropriate (usually based on the scenario and where it might lead).<br/><br/>Maybe it's a result of having such a fluid, variable play group (or none at all, and seeking one) that's got me into that mode by default. Maybe your experiences reflect far more stable and consistent play groups... or maybe you and yours don't have any/many lines or veils and, so, don't see the need to establish them and, thus, NOGH play.<br/><br/>Hmmm... that makes me wonder: can one have lines and veils and still play IWNAY? Say, maybe, I just will not tolerate child abuse (line), but am willing to be pushed on any other conceivable subject, with a clear IWNAY perspective? I reckon if its a continuum between IWNAY and NOGH then somewhere in that continuum is a blend of NOGH on THESE issues, but the rest is IWNAY. Huh... hadn't really thought it through like that. I've really only ever considered it binary, but that could be a sign that I only see IWNAY as a "valid" or "worthwhile" stance if one is going to go into the dark (or light) places with which one is most uncomfortable. IWNAY play about something that doesn't push my buttons seems... flat, I reckon.<br/><br/>OK, anyone got a thought about that? I'm willing to buy into the continuum theory, but someone has to show me that IWNAY can be done in "half measures" or sort of "progressively," ramping up but never peaking because the thinnest air is still feared (and, thus, sealed off behind NOGH). I'm dubious, now,, of the continuum theory....\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Hituro</cite>Is it really the case that RPGs delve into the dark side when played by teens because that's what teens want to do, or because they attract those teens interested in the dark side through reputation, while repelling those who are not?</blockquote>\nGood point. I don't know. I can think of myself back then... and I don't know that I got into D&amp;D (blue book) because I wanted to kill things. I think the mound of treasure drew me more than the sword or the dragon. So when were my most "dark adolescent" games, what were they...?<br/><br/>Ya know... I don't really recall, to be honest. Sure, if viewed through a post-modern lens, the idea of genocide of species because they're "monsters" is sort of abhorrent. But we were just trooping through dungeons and using our Kewl Powerz and thinking up traps and how to avoid them. I recall far more times where we were trying to con our way past challenges, rather than hack them into giblets ("Dungeon Cleaners--Dust Free By 3! We're scheduled to do this treasure room today, if you'd be so kind as to open the door?"). By sixteen, I was playing Pendragon with a girlfriend and, let's just say, the "Ardor" thing was the source of much fun (though, OOC, we violated the hell out of the "no consummation" tradition of Ardor).<br/><br/>So, hell,, maybe I'm unique, but the "lure of the dark" didn't really come down the pipe until WAY past adolescence, with things like CoC and Dark Champions and Warhammer coming into my hands during and after college. Hehe... late developer, maybe?<br/>[continued]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_186785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186785/#Comment_186785" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T07:36:03+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  7:36AM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyhow, I'd have to say that it's not an either/or proposition, David D. Some are lured by the "bad boy" or "secret club" image of some games (I'd bet a LOT of Vamp players, for instance), some are lured because they want to "play Tolkien" or "play Star Wars" or some other lighter draw to be creative in a stimulating setting or context. Still more come for the tactics and competition, no different from being into chess (straying a bit into minis stuff, here, but I saw it a lot with Champions and "Danger Rooming" being a whole night's session). Even in this thread's context (the "willingness to be tender" in IWNAY play), I'd say it's a varied split between those cruel to their soft-hearted mates (discomfited) and those who are fascinated with the romance and sensuality that so underlies much of genre fiction (really, most fiction).<br/><br/>I'd say again, though, that it's the games' tones, settings, artwork, and mechanical hooks which push play most towards dark (or light) themes. No one plays Dread: TFBOP to enact a romantic tension between two members of a Cabal--there's no tools for doing so; you might as well put the book away and just use the Sick Six System and homebrew "lovey dovey" traits. Likewise, trying to play It's Complicated as a Reservoir Dogs game is... well, actually, that works, because IC is a very flexible system (highly generic).<br/><br/>OK, point made, Thomas--I can't really think of a game that truly DRIVE towards tenders, that makes it hard to play dark or cruelly. I will concede that there is a skew to the balance, in our hobby.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Meguey</cite>The struggle is to stick to it.</blockquote>\nNo doubt. Which is why I pretty much presuppose love, for true IWNAY play in very difficult subjects. And love means, for me, merely placing another over oneself--HOW could I abandon one for whom I care more than myself? While I reckon that the mode of IWNAY play mentioned by Mark W might work--I can take it if you can, bub!--it's not the way I would approach IWNAY play. But I'm not into S&amp;M either... well, maybe a little light bondage, all in laughter and fun, with a Safe Word--but no striking and cutting and domineering, which is how I imagine the "emotional chicken game" playing out.<br/><br/>OK, longer than I intended, but I stumbled into that continuum uncertainty and talk of the motivations to play ANY sorts of RPGs.

It's not like there's no precedent (Once Upon a Time springs to mine). Build a reward cycle that encourage "tender" play--we have plenty of examples how to do a RC in general, so just apply your favorite (or a new one) to mechanics which resolve conflicts with peace or joy or contentment or love, not with fighting or fear or control. Read every AP you can find about games played with young children of mixed genders (they're heartwarming in and of themselves, but they also show how the less "jaded" player approaches certain challenges--surprising, often!).<br/><br/>But that's just the "gaming world"--if you want to change The World, you can start by pressuring every government over which you have any influence to provide for its people, regardless of their perceived "worth" to society. The One Thing that would get the world on track towards our next stage of evolution would be to stop valuing people in relative terms (he's smarter, so teach him more; she works harder, so pay her more). If people and policies treated every person as equal and worthwhile and a jewel of consciousness, unique in all time and reality, it would be VERY hard to go to war, or step over a body on the sidewalk, or expect a certain class of people to be the shit-eaters.<br/><br/>But THAT is definitely... another thread.

It's not a better way to play, and I certainly would not advise it to everyone. Heck, I rarely if ever play that way myself, and I have two solid groups of folks I feel pretty seriously safe with. IWNAY also has strong admonitions to the listener; if this scene of delicate tenderness is uncomfortable for you, stay with it, try to find out why - are all those things talked about above, about gender roles and the drive to hack and slash and deny emotion, playing out somewhere deep inside?  Stay with it, stretch yourself, learn something real. That other slant, where IWNAY means I can pour out abusive shit all over you and you have to take it? Not what I want at all. <br/><br/>I'll be watching for those threads on designing for tenderness.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_186935">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/186935/#Comment_186935" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-08T15:22:14+00:00" title="January  8, 2009  3:22PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What Meg said. I wasn't meaning to suggest that brutal face-stabby one-upsmanship was IWNAY, I was proposing it as an example of Paul's hypothetical "I <b>will definitely</b> abandon you" play.<br/><br/>It feels pretty abusive to me, but I can't rule out that it was fully consensual as reported to me. In which case it's probably a weird form of gamist play that looks all issue-heavy from the surface but is really "Truth or Dare" in RPG form.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
