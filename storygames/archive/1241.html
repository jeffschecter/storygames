                    I decided to page through some of my old accounts and notes and see if I couldn't throw a few more data points out here with some specifics.  <br/>
<br/>
1.  Yahoogroups: Batman Begins RPG.<br/>
<br/>
At approximately the time of the release of the Batman Begins movie, there was the usual glut of yahoogroups RP groups initiated based on it.  Typically these begin well before the movie is actually released and can often be based upon just a trailer.  Here is the advertisement text used: <br/>
<br/>
"It began as a quest for justice, to defend those who could not defend themselves, to restore a lost city's former glory. But the battle has only just commenced. As Lt. Gordon worried, escalation of a different sort is about to strike Gotham. The criminals will come to battle the mighty Bat, and the city must watch in helpless terror as they first come to know the likes of Joker, Riddler, and others. <br/>
<br/>
Do you dare choose sides? Will you join his fight? <br/>
<br/>
The Legend of the Dark Knight continues here. Batman has only just begun."<br/>
<br/>
Since I am a dedicated Gotham City nerd and love Batman comics, and the movie, I decided I wanted to participate.  I was particularly encouraged by the prominent place of Gordon in both the movie and in the ad for this game, since he's one of my favorite comic book characters (the best DC comic in recent years, in my opinion, was the cop-centered Gotham Central.)  And the Year One-ness of the setting would allow me to do something with a character without worrying about the continuity.  Excellent. <br/>
<br/>
When you sign up for a yahoogroup, you get several files automatically mailed to you, of the selection of the group moderator. The first was basically an expanded version of the advertisement. Of interest to observers is the following paragraph: "Ideally, this will be an exciting, character intensive game with plenty of opportunity for interaction and creative development.  We welcome both original characters from the Batman universe, and created characters new to Gotham City.  All with the drive to make this game great are welcome."  File 2: a summary of the movie. <br/>
<br/>
File 3 is a list of rules. Here are some excerpts of interest: "1.  The GM(s) is in charge.  No arguments.  If she asks your character to do something uncharacteristic, you are more than welcome to plead your case.  She will work out a solution to satisfy your character and the current plotline.  Otherwise, her word is law."<br/>
<br/>
"3.  Ideally, you should make the effort to post once every 24 hours.  However, we will accept one post every two to three days.  You should never go longer than one week without a post, even if it is just a quick scene to let us know where your character is currently located.  If you will be away from your computer for an extended period of time, please let the GM know in advance.  Please do not sign on for an integral character if you are not able to keep up with the posting this role will demand.  If you do not post at least once a week for your character, the GM withholds the right to unsub you and reassign your character.  This is a fast paced game, and we cannot have players who are not willing to keep up with the posting demands."<br/>
<br/>
"4.  If a player has not posted for his character within 72 hours, the GM, the player currently interacting with him, or another player in the game will move his character for him, probably ending the scene and putting said character in a location where interaction will be minimal until the player returns or the character is reassigned."<br/>
<br/>
"5.  After being accepted to the game, you will have two weeks to catch up on the archives, understand the current threads, and join the game.  If you do not join the game within two weeks, you will be removed.  (Summaries of the current plotlines can be found under Bat's Notes in the Files section of the group.  Archived stories can be obtained by emailing the GM.)"<br/>
<br/>
"6.  Character's sexuality is open to creativity.  (HGLBT)  You will be expected to follow the same header guidelines as everyone else, however."<br/>
<br/>
"8.  Do not seriously harm or kill another person's character without his/her permission.  To the same end, remember that your characters are not invincible.  No mortal character is unbeatable, and even immortal characters get knocked around a little.  If someone throws a punch, you can't always duck out of the way and avoid getting a black eye.  While death can be avoided, minor injuries happen to everyone.  Play fair!                </div>

                            "9.  You are allowed two characters when beginning the game.  You may be allowed more than two characters once your posting frequency and writing ability has been established. "<br/>
<br/>
"Failure to comply by the aforementioned rules will result in the following disciplinary action: First Offense:  Written warning identifying the problem and asking for a quick remedy. Second Offense:  Probation which involves being placed upon moderation for the space of one month during which your posts will be censored for content before being seen by the group.  You will be notified of this action via email. Third Offense:  Immediate expulsion from the list.  Your character will be either killed or reassigned and you will be placed on the game Black List."<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, a lot of these rules are honored in the breach.  Lurkers were common both on this game and other games, so the bit about having two weeks to join or be removed was not enforced.  And as I noted in the other thread, eventually posting slows to a crawl and stops. <br/>
<br/>
File 4 was a FAQ that replicated many of the rules in more detail.<br/>
<br/>
File 5 was an advertisement for canon characters and "areas" for non-canon characters (cops, lawyers, journalists, etc.) which would be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
File 6 was a "character query", the way you get a character assigned to you on the game.  It included personal contact information, and Name, Secret Identity:  (If Any.), Age, Gender, Physical Appearance, Height, Weight, Eye color, Hair color, Ethnic Origin, Personality ("Outgoing, introverted, etc.  Include at least three personality flaws.  No common sense, arrogant, etc."), Fears/Weakness ("Different from personality flaws.  These are the characters phobias and bad habits which may cause him/her trouble during play."),  Skills/Powers:  ("If applicable, please explain WHY your human character has inhuman inabilities."), Character History:  ("This is the most important part of the application.  Make it good.  Explore the character; why s/he does what s/he does, what made s/he who they are today, what events modeled them, what events scarred them.  This will be considered part of your writing sample, so make it as well written and thought out as you can.  It cannot be too long or too detailed.  However, it can be too short, so make sure you let us know what your character's back story really is.")<br/>
<br/>
You were also required to do a writing sample of a sample post, which was also called the "most important part" of the application. Ahem. <br/>
<br/>
The remainder of the files were for your use once you joined the game, including a character profile which was to be posted to the Yahoogroup, and a way to put common NPCs into the game.<br/>
<br/>
This was actually a fairly file-intensive game, I'd say few of my yahoogroups RP groups had this level of detail put on both the rules and guidance for what characters are appropriate. I'll give a little more "standard" experience later in the thread. But I think there is something to be gained from looking at what the creator of the game thought was the issues they might run into.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote up an application to play Mackenzie "Hardback" Bock, an educated African-American GCPD detective in normal comics continuity, in this version of the Batman mythos, I had him undercover as a goon.  That way I could get involved with criminal stuff and report to Gordon and have all the crazy mopey dilemmas that undercover cops have gotten into in comics and TV since time immemorial. <br/>

                            All of the characters were made over the course of about four weeks. Canon-adapted characters included: Batman, Dr. Leslie Thompkins, Rupert Thorne, Harlene Quinzel, Alfred, the Joker, Catwoman, Wildcat, Jim Gordon, my own Mackenzie Bock version, Sarah Essen, Rachel Dawes, and Harvey Dent.  Original characters included: "a former Navy SEAL haunted by ghosts of his past", "a normal man who would never 'spill the beans'", "an electrifying civilian with an agenda of her own" (electrifying is a pun, she has electrical powers), "an inmate at Arkham Asylum", and "a nurse at Arkham".  <br/>
<br/>
I was highly impressed that people would play relatively normal characters. The electrical metahuman vigilante and Navy SEAL were more typical for original characters for these games. It was clear that the game creator's emphasis on the civilian population of Gotham (matching the movie's costarring billing for Alfred, Rachel and Gordon) had some effect on the game applicants.<br/>
<br/>
The Photos section of the game quickly filled up with people picking actors of various sorts for their characters.  (I picked Ice-T as Bock, found a cool OG picture of him with a gun.)<br/>
<br/>
Edit: tomorrow, what happened in the actual game.                        </div>
