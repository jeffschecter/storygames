They claim BGG is overrun with pics of girls' cleavage, babies with game components and cats in boxes.<br/><br/>It's really just a side effect of RPGer culture, isn't it? I mean, we tend to build ephemeral stuff with words when we play, and on the whole we're deeply suspicious of  any sort of physical or rules artifacts that seem to threaten the supremacy of the word-stuff in our games.<br/><br/>I mean, that very nature is a bit of why we get to be snobby and elitist about this stuff, isn't it?<br/><br/>Edit: Okay, so that was overly crochety, so howabout I give a more positive suggestion? Video and sound. Not as easily done, admittedly, but might actually show off an RPG or SG in a way that stills of people playing can't.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_315128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315128/#Comment_315128" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-02T10:46:39+00:00" title="March  2, 2011 10:46AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Fiasco at Go Play Jr. 2008:</b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/2716269872_6b45dd0f11.jpg?v=0"/><br/><br/><b>Fiasco at Go Play 2010:</b><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc4/hs033.snc4/34026_10150212400115113_798600112_13358393_7680041_n.jpg"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315134">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TylerT" title="TylerT"><img alt="TylerT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/081/nG0TGDSWA48LA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TylerT">TylerT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315134/#Comment_315134" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-02T10:56:59+00:00" title="March  2, 2011 10:56AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            lets contact bbg about this, even if you have tried in the past try again<br/><br/><br/><a href="http://rpggeek.com/contactform" rel="nofollow">click here for their contact page</a><br/><br/><br/>this is what i sent them<br/><br/>"RPG geek images are really really boring.<br/><br/>Board game geek has been instrumental in getting more people to play more board games more often.<br/><br/>I believe this is in part because board game geek makes it's games look visually appealing. while a little frivolous from a database perspective, images of actual people, actually enjoying games ARE KEY to getting more people to game.<br/><br/>These images are entertaining<br/><br/>These images prove were not just a bunch virgins or wacky larpers.<br/><br/>These images help the outside world relate to us!<br/><br/>Do not be so short sighted!

They claim BGG is overrun with pics of girls' cleavage, babies with game components and cats in boxes.</blockquote>\nThey could still set some standards and guidelines and require pics to be approved or whatever so there's no random shit. :shrug: I think it just alienates people.<br/><br/>I would agree, and that was my argument. Of course, I actually <i>like</i> all the boobies and cute kids and kitties on BGG. <br/><br/>I think such a social hobby needs to be about people as much as the tools we use to play, so for me it was an odd decision on the part of the RPGGeek moderators. <br/><br/>On the positive side, they are getting some really nice play-by-post forums going and good session reports for a variety of games. I'm still finding value in the site.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_315441">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/315441/#Comment_315441" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-03-04T06:18:37+00:00" title="March  4, 2011  6:18AM">March 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            BTW, if you go into the RPGGeek photo gallery and set the Gallery tab to People, you will find pics of people playing games.

No threads about this were deleted (and if they were, I'd be pretty pissed about it).  We do have galleries which we employ on RPG Geek to categorize pictures into Covers, Play (the game in play) and Creative (painted minis, props for games, etc). All three categories bubble up to the front page - nothing is filtered. You can, however, change the front page default behavior to only show Covers or only show Play or only show Creative.  I half remember a discussion about the endless supply of cats in box tops and girls holding boxes at chest height - and those tend to get rejected by the user-guided moderation but that's nothing to do with play pics or creative pics which we encourage and generally sail through the geek-modding process. Right now, the community is focused on database entry and so the vast majority of images are cover shots - but you guys are free to upload whatever play pics you want.<br/><br/>I'm sorry that anyone got the impression that such images were not allowed or discouraged. It's my fault for letting this perpetuate here for far too long.<br/><br/>--<br/>Dave Bernazzani<br/><a href="/forums/profile/rpggeek">@rpggeek</a><br/>www.rpggeek.com                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
