This discussion reminded me of both how awful that can be what it fails and how creatively rewarding it can be when it works.  I think the key is how the group negotiates the parameters of an in-game challenge.  Does the GM simply toss out an obstacle, and the players tackle it?  If the players think of a way to dodge it, is the challenge overcome, or moved, or simply negated?  Which of these are acceptable?  Does the usual challenge resolution method, such as die rolls, need to be employed?<br/><br/>Here are some examples of what I'm talking about:<br/><br/><b>1. No competition for advantage:</b><br/><br/>GM: Around the corner, it dead ends!  You're now trapped!  Looks like you'll have to turn and face these scary bastards!<br/><br/>P1: Shit!  I draw my sword.  Alright, guys, let's form a wall so no one gets surrounded.<br/><br/><br/><b>2. Taking turns or trading advantages:</b><br/><br/>GM: Around the corner, it dead ends!  You're now trapped!  Looks like you'll have to turn and face these scary bastards!<br/><br/>P1: I jump onto a rooftop to escape!<br/><br/>GM: Oh! Um, can you jump onto a rooftop?<br/><br/>P1: Sure I can!<br/><br/>GM: Hmm.  Well, okay, I'll go along with that, but only if you are now spotted by the archers of the city guard!<br/><br/>P1: Yikes!  Okay, yeah, I jump up, lose the pursuers, and then, uh oh...<br/><br/>GM: ...you see an arrow heading toward you.  Roll to dodge!<br/><br/><br/><b>3. Negotiating and then rolling for advantage:</b><br/><br/>GM: Around the corner, it dead ends!  You're now trapped!  Looks like you'll have to turn and face these scary bastards!<br/><br/>P1: I jump onto a rooftop to escape!<br/><br/>GM: Oh! Um, can you jump onto a rooftop?<br/><br/>P1: Sure I can!<br/><br/>GM: Hmm.  Well, okay, I'll go along with that, but only if you are now spotted by the archers of the city guard!<br/><br/>P1: Oh geez, which is worse?  I dunno, man.<br/><br/>GM: Let's roll!<br/><br/>P1: Yeah!  High roll, I get up there quickly and subtly, no one notices.<br/><br/>GM: Low roll, the guards shoot you as you're pulling yourself up, defenseless.  Medium roll, you fail the climb, and the scary guys catch up. <br/><br/>P1: Here goes nothing!<br/><br/><br/><b>4. Competing for advantage by pure argument:</b><br/><br/>GM: Around the corner, it dead ends!  You're now trapped!  Looks like you'll have to turn and face these scary bastards!<br/><br/>P1: Wait, how do we get trapped?  As soon as we look around the corner, we can see it's a dead end, so we just keep going past it.<br/><br/>GM: Okay, you're running full speed, then you change your momentum to turn, then you change it again to go straight... the scary guys make up ground and swing for your legs!<br/><br/>P1: Why would we break stride until we knew we could turn?  You can glance to the side without slowing.<br/><br/>GM: Well, you did say you were turning.  You didn't say "we'll look first, and then turn".<br/><br/>P1: But that'd be stupid.<br/><br/>GM: Doesn't seem stupid to me.  Let's roll.  Evens you don't break stride; odds, they make up some ground and get a swing at you.<br/><br/>P1: But if I roll odds, I still don't see how it'd make any sense for them to make up ground on us.  Any idiot can glance without slowing.  We're not incompetent.<br/><br/>GM: Okay now you're being a dick and trying to delay the challenge.  What fun is that?  How much longer do you want to run and turn corners before you fight?<br/><br/>P1: If I have to fight, fine, but don't give me a bogus reason for it.  Don't tell me I'm in a fight because I'm too stupid to look before turning.<br/><br/><b>Turning (1) into (2) or (3) is where a lot of the creativity comes in!  This is part of why you'd tackle an imaginary challenge instead of a well-calibrated board game.  But how do you make sure (2) and (3) don't become (4)?</b>  I have plenty of thoughts on this, but I think this post is good to go as an opener.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JasonT" title="JasonT"><img alt="JasonT" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JasonT">JasonT</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419226/#Comment_419226" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T06:53:37+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  6:53AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man, it like 4 came from secret audio recordings of any of a number of games I ran from awhile back. My working plan for the next time this came up has long been to try to turn 4 back into 3, though you paint a pretty clear picture of how an argumentative player can even dispute "Let's roll...." <br/><br/>Would it go better if that suggestion to roll were specifically framed as rolling something on their character sheet (rather than roll even/odd), I wonder? Like: "Well, things are stressful and confusing. You're moving pretty fast. Roll against your Perception. Succeed, and you notice it's a dead end before you turn. Fail, and through a trick of the shadows, you mistake a dead end for a way through, but don't realize until it's too late." Or perhaps it would be better to let them have that first set-up as a freebie, then reframe the same obstacle a few moments later as something harder to argue with, like: "Okay, you can run past that dead end without breaking stride. Ahead, you see turns to the left and the right as far as the eye can see. You can keep running at full speed as you pass each one, but if you do, you're going to have to make an Agility roll to change directions suddenly. And along the way, you'll be making contested Strength rolls against their Strength to see whether they catch up...."<br/><br/>I personally dislike turning everything into rolls like that, but I tend to lean on it when players don't get the logic of why things are happening. Really looking forward to how others address this kind of thing, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419227">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419227/#Comment_419227" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T07:17:12+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  7:17AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2013 7:19AM by komradebob.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Find different players than the one in example 4.

I mean, yes, I have played with people who have given me trouble and who I won't play certain games with (if ever again at all), so sometimes that advice is fine. Personally, though, I don't consider example 4 above a "banished from my gaming circle" offense. As WarriorMonk pointed out in the thread that inspired this one, these are my friends we're talking about. My friends are reasonable and intelligent people; we learn and change and grow, we have gotten better about how we play games together. They're people I enjoy gaming with, despite the occasional dispute. I would rather figure something out that works for all of us than just declare them exiled. (Edit to add: And if getting pissy over a game were a one-strike-and-you're-out kind of thing, I'd have been booted myself years ago...)<br/><br/>More to the point: The player in example 4 might be acting like a jerk about it, but they might also have a valid point. Even if you're not concerned with cries of "That's not fair!", what about murmurs of, "Wait, why is this happening? I don't get it." If I'm putting players into situations that they have a hard time following or enjoying, that's a problem I need to deal with.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419232">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419232/#Comment_419232" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T08:01:32+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  8:01AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I can think of a few occasions I would have booted myself as well.<br/><br/>Actually, if you count those times I dropped out of something I wasn't enjoying due to clashes in playstyle (pissyfit or not) as self-booting, I guess I have done that on a few occasions. <br/><br/>Back to the original point, though.<br/><br/>I look at those examples and wonder how much a given player has available to manipulate in terms of resources and what that means in context of continuing to play.<br/><br/>I know I harp on this point, but if I'm playing an RPG and all I have to use is my personal character <b>and</b> chargen is lengthy in one fashion or another, I may well be tempted to play like the player in example 4.

There are people who will argue over the rules of Monopoly or Chess. But I think we've all played with (and even occasionally been) That Guy in #4; usually late in the evening and libatiously lubricated.<br/> <br/>So, let's assume a baseline indicator of willing/enthusiastic/creative players (GM included). I've been toying with the idea that parameters must be set for the fiction.<br/>That is to say: establish what the basic result is first, then collaboratively agree on how that result occurred.<br/><br/>In the "2d6 mechanics" thread, I had a notion of establishing patterns of thought.<br/>A roll would indicate Linear (straight forward, obvious, task-resolution) solutions; Centers (to the heart of the matter, what is your actual goal, conflict-resolution) solutions; and Corners (outside the box, creative/dramatic) solutions. A successful roll would tell us that what ever we come up with WILL work; we just have to fit the pattern to the fiction (of course always keeping with the setting and tone of the situation).<br/><br/>In the example of the alley-way, what is a (Linear) straight-forward, obvious solution? What is the (Centered) actual goal of the players? Escape? Gain tactical advantage? What is the (Corners) cinematic/dramatic/just-so-crazy-it-might-work solution? Having already established that it WILL work, you are no longer arguing against each other but, perhaps, arguing to top one another's ideas. Collaborative one-up-manship until someone says: Oo! That's cool! THAT'S what happens!" The same can apply to failure. There's many ways of establishing who gets the final say but I would suggest the player who initiated the action (rolled the dice). And, yes, That Guy/Gal will still argue his/her idea was best - good rules can't fix bad behaviour but they can help to identify it.<br/><br/> I also have the Alec Baldwin - Glenngary Glen Ross solution but I'll let you pick this idea apart first.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419237/#Comment_419237" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T09:14:08+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  9:14AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2013 9:14AM by J_Walton.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There are so many problems with 2, 3, and 4, honestly.<br/><br/>In <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>, you're negotiating with the fiction?

Some games have mechanics that work that way, where you force someone to make a choice, but it seems really strange and socially messed up as part of freeplay. RPGs aren't some sort of zero-sum game where each player has to have some kind of boon to make up for a boon given to another player. How about you just follow or interrogate the fiction and see what happens? Like:<br/><br/>GM: Around the corner, it dead ends! What do yo do?

Extremely rare case. Even this doesn't mean a TPK.<br/><br/>On the few occassions something like 4 happened, the rest of the players tend to collaborate with the GM and add logical arguments to help the negotiation, for the sake of not breaking the inmersion or letting players emotions contaminate the creative agenda. Worst case escenario is when situation isn't resolved to satisfaction of one of the sides and then later they use the fiction to make them even. On this, an angry GM is as bad as an angry GM. We have seen games breake before because of this, so our first reaction is to negotiate and concede something to each side.<br/><br/>The worst kind of player/GM we ever had on the table were the stubborn kind, for whom no logic applies save their own and keep the argument going until they win or even raise new arguments later just to have it their way somehow. It's because of this that we made 3 into a rule where, <i>never mind the logic arguments used</i>, one side wins, the other loses, there are no hard feelings except against the dice, and the game moves on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419239/#Comment_419239" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T09:50:47+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  9:50AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's hard not to see this kind of dysfunction as a case of bad game design.

Let me rephrase it, just to see if I can find out why do I still play it that way and enjoy it:<br/><br/>In my table, example 1 would also be totally a no-go. For us GMs shouldn't tell you what to to, they are supposed to ask you what do you want to do and say if it's possible and the requirements. If player's input looks like an improvement to the story, the GM may even adjust the fiction, bend or breake some sules to make it happen. This is our new Rule Zero, which doubles for a "say yes or roll the dice" specifying when to say "no", "yes" or "roll the dice".<br/><br/>Example 2 happens most of the time, though it's actually more like:<br/><br/>GM: Around the corner, it dead ends! You're now trapped! Either you'll have to turn and face these scary bastards or find another way out! What do you do?<br/><br/>P1: I jump onto a rooftop to escape!<br/><br/>GM: Oh! Can you jump onto a... 12 feet rooftop?<br/><br/>P1: (checks his character sheet) Sure I can!<br/><br/>GM: Ok, roll perception, or better alert if you've got ranks on that.<br/><br/>P1: no, no Alert, Perception it is! (rolls and fails)<br/><br/>GM: Yeah, jumping up is the best way to get out! No, don't roll for the jump, you're already up there. (rolls for archer's perception, success)<br/><br/>P1: Oh boy, this can't be good...<br/><br/>GM: Now you're a perfect target for the archers of the city guard! <br/><br/>P1: wait, wouldn't my character know that the guards had bows? we've seen them before!<br/><br/>GM: Agreed, roll Intelligence to see if you remembered that before jumping up the roof.<br/><br/><br/><br/>GM: The rest of you, roll alert, perception or intelligence, try to save him please! Of course, whoever fails is right up behind him on top of that roof... don't worry, you still get to Roll to dodge.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419247">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419247/#Comment_419247" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T11:13:17+00:00" title="July 30, 2013 11:13AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In 4 <br/>P1: Wait, how do we get trapped?

I mean, for me part of the work as a GM is to single out these assumptions and turn them into skill or ability checks.

I like that too, but it seems off-topic to me here.<br/><br/>WarriorMonk, if the GM is proud of the challenge he's invented in These Scary Bastards, I believe that "now face them!" style of narration is quite common.<br/><br/>Paul, I agree there should be some game design here.  I may throw around some ideas for that.<br/><br/>Jonathan, yeah, playing tit for tat with establishing fiction looks really weird when highlighted, but I think this secretly goes on in freeform tactical play <i>all the time</i>.  <br/><br/>When it's the GM's job to provide challenge, and the players' job to overcome challenge <i>by applying their wits to the fiction</i>, then often there's a mismatch between what's prepped* and what happens.  So as the players are stepping up to be clever, while hoping they're not ruining a fun prepped challenge... and as the GM is trying to reward their cleverness, while hoping there's still some challenge left... "what should happen next?" often enters a murky state.<br/><br/>There are many ways out of this murk:<br/>- impartial arbitration based on game principles<br/>- two sides compete to get their way<br/>- two sides collaborate to compromise<br/>- let the dice decide<br/>- give one side fiat powers<br/>- pause play and discuss out-of-game<br/>- pay game resources (the Universalis solution)<br/><br/>WarriorMonk's style melds a bunch of these, and it while it isn't my personal first choice, I think it has a lot going for it:<br/>- anyone who's firing creatively has a <i>lot</i> of options for input<br/>- color and fictional situation can change quickly, which can be exciting<br/>- it strives to channel and arbitrate problematic player impulses rather than simply prohibiting them, and some players respond <i>way</i> better to "yes, but" than to "no"<br/>- with lots of ad lib and the nature of challenges turning on a dime, the GM will probably (a) get the hint not to waste much time on prep, and (b) not need to prep much anyway<br/><br/>Which is not to say that the bad scenario, # 4, isn't a threat.  How to keep it at bay?  Here's the trick, I think: <b>the group needs to know, and be able to reference when needed, the higher-level collaboration that encompasses the immediate competition</b>.  I think the collaboration is always there!  Always!  But naming it and having it at your fingertips can be tricky.  Any game (or non-game freeform toolkit, if you view it that way) that helps the players with this is doing a great service, in my opinion.<br/><br/>* if not before the session, then at least a little bit before it comes up; the point is that the GM has some investment in X happening                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419257/#Comment_419257" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T14:16:46+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  2:16PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            David, I think Dani is spot-on and not off-topic at all. It's not about making decisions based on drama or story concerns. Forget that. It's about letting go of the idea that the GM's job is to make things difficult. You're playing an exciting premise, right? Full of danger and challenges? So if you do your job as GM and just <i>say what's happening in the fiction</i>, it'll be exciting and dangerous and challenging and the players will have to use their cleverness to overcome the obstacles. The NPCs are trying to trick the players, but the GM shouldn't be trying to. You don't have to try to make things difficult; things are already difficult! It's an incredibly freeing perspective to take, actually. At least, it was for me.<br/><br/>It also means the GM really can't have any firm ideas about what's going to happen. You just say what the current situation is and ask the players what they do. If you try to think about drama and story and such, this will mess you up here, actually. It's not about what's difficult or dramatic, but about what naturally happens next, given all the other things that we know. Sometimes this means looking at your prep and being like: "Who is going to be upset about what just happened?" and then have them do something about it. It's not always at the tip of your tongue. But if the premise is full of excitement and danger, then exciting and dangerous stuff is inevitably going to happen.<br/><br/>Actually, it's much easier to challenge the players if you don't try to decide what's going to happen next!  You just are like: "So... uh, now you're surrounded and have discovered that there's archers up on the rooftops... what do you do?" It's the players' job to figure out how to get out of the situation (fighting, negotiating, fleeing, magic, surrendering, getting killed, whatever), not the GM's job. The GM's job is to make the situation clear and then answer any questions the players have about it, since they probably need more information if they're going to use their cleverness to get out of it. Playing the "what is the GM thinking?" game where you try to guess the "correct" answer that will get you out of a situation is, IMO, really frustrating to the players. But if the GM has no particular ideas, then the players really can be clever (as opposed to playing bullshit mind games) in figuring out a way out of an "impossible" situation.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's my experience.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419258">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419258/#Comment_419258" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T14:43:17+00:00" title="July 30, 2013  2:43PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2013 2:56PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Everyone, please avert your eyes while I bring up GNS!

I mean, I understand why, but this is totally preposterous and unnecessary. For once, there's Illusionism (well, Collaboration too, though I don't rely too heavily on it, I'll go later on this) and there's also Recycling: that challenge the players avoided can always be reused later if designed in a modular way.<br/><br/>But after seeing myself and a three other GMs using this style of narration with different degrees of failure I think I found the root of the problem: Player/GM expectatives on their Creative Investment. The more time and effort a GM or player uses to create something for the game, the more attached they grow to it and the more payback they want from that investment. The more payback they want from it, the more prone they are to use railroading techniques. The more they use railroading, the higher the chance of misuse.<br/><br/>Think of the detachable Paranoia Troubleshooter's clones or characters from games with a really simple character creation processes, or how easy is to whip out a can of generic Orcs come out from nowhere against the players; think about pre-gens; fun and cheap in terms of time and creative investment. Now compare those to an hour of careful character creation, two for making a session, a couple of weeks invested in creating a campaign setting, all the time and money we spend on manuals and modules... doesn't make you want to railroad as a GM, or argument your way out of trouble as a player until your GM's ears fall?<br/><br/>That's why I've been working in less and less complicated systems that still produce the same color or effect than the setting original system (which means less time to create anything) and randomizers to create interesting color &amp; tactics for challenges on the go (which means you can still get quality material without wasting enough time to grow attached to it.\n<blockquote><br/>Which is not to say that the bad scenario, # 4, isn't a threat.  How to keep it at bay?  Here's the trick, I think: <b>the group needs to know, and be able to reference when needed, the higher-level collaboration that encompasses the immediate competition</b>.  I think the collaboration is always there!  Always!  But naming it and having it at your fingertips can be tricky.  Any game (or non-game freeform toolkit, if you view it that way) that helps the players with this is doing a great service, in my opinion.<br/></blockquote>\nYou're right about Collaboration. It's part of every single game, on it's most basic form as a way to level everybody to the same situation to start the game fairly. Now, asking players more than that requires a different approach to the definition of the game and limiting what's going to be fun about it and what not. It's not a usual philosophy for an RPG, though RPGs now aren't going for usual at all and that's what is so good about them.<br/><br/>So, for a game with a more collaborative agenda, assuming things that will ruin the excitement of overcoming a difficult challenge is no fun (and cheating) Main fun here will be creating a coherent story with the help of all players, so don't railroad or ruin the mood insisting in something that won't fit the setting's logic. You'll be given author tools to bend the fiction along with the responsability of not breaking it, so you better leave competition out of this. Have your group of players adhere to this and the game will work wonderfully.<br/><br/>For a game with a flexible agenda between competition and collaboration you'll find a moment for each one, though you will need coordinating a set of techniques that allow players to discern when is being applied one or the other. Otherwise you risk dysfunctional play at each step. Players need to be this flexible too for this to work, but the reward when you make it work is as you say Dave: you get the best of both worlds, players compete against the GM or each other and collaborate to make both victory and failure memorable moments.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_419279">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419279/#Comment_419279" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-30T22:57:34+00:00" title="July 30, 2013 10:57PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 30, 2013 11:02PM by creases.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm not sure I tooooootally get what's going on in this thread, but I seem to have thought juice dribbling out, and that's a personal problem but now you must all be embarrassed for me by beholding my off-topicality(???).<br/><br/>In my experience with Apocalypse World, there is definitely a level of competition in this sense going on between the MC and the PCs. My interpretation is that "Be a fan of the PCs" often means "put them through the ringer to see what they're made of"! And since THAT (and "Make their lives interesting") is the core of the MC's agenda in that game, anything that puts the MC in a better position to put the PCs in situations that challenge them personally, I mean really put them through the crucible psychologically and morally, is essentially an advantage for the MC---if I understand <a href="/forums/profile/David_Berg%27s">@David_Berg's</a> use of the word up there. In fact, I thought Vincent was pretty explicit that it's the MC's job to make things "difficult" <i>in this very specific sense of "difficult"</i>. This design principle is even clearer in the Sundered Lands games, but as far as I've ever played AW, it's there too. In short, I see AW as a clear case of 3, and indeed right in a really satisfying gamist sweet spot.<br/><br/>(To be clear, I'm not saying the PCs don't want to be put in those positions. It's just not their job to put themselves there; it's their job to get out of them more or less intact. And getting them OUT of trouble isn't the MC's job---"being a fan" means wanting to be with them to the bitter end, though it be an untimely one! It means wanting to see what they were made of after all, and wanting to see how their fate shakes out for them.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419311">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419311/#Comment_419311" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T10:19:54+00:00" title="July 31, 2013 10:19AM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 31, 2013 10:22AM by Paul88.">edited July 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I was thinking ,, when I said in my last post are we just talking about rail-road play, this could apply to anything that has an agenda or path set down.<br/><br/>Players trying to use the best skill in a situation, instead of being creative with the character,,, are we being rail-roaded by the game set-up to play in a skills way.<br/><br/>A positional system is great for knowing how good you are compared to,,,,<br/>But a creative system doesn't tell you anything only your imagination can help you out or the combined collaboration of the table, (playing group) <br/>That out the way, I think 4 falls down with cause and effect issue, simulation.

"Character faces tough choice about what to do!  Clever action would be good!" is nearly universal to improv character play.  So, sure, that's a challenge to the player, in the same way that coming up with good threats or setting description is a challenge to the GM.  But if you think that's the same as being challenged to make a clever move in chess, I strongly disagree.  I'm talking about roleplay that's more chess-like.  I wish I could succinctly describe the difference, but I don't think I can.  For anyone who wants to discuss that specifically, might I suggest starting another thread?<br/><br/>Regarding difficulty, in challenge-based gaming this is important, and the idea that the GM can just do "whatever would happen" and expect good challenges (i.e. satisfying difficulty levels, as opposed to cakewalks or sure TPKs) to fall out is pure fantasy.  There are many ways for the GM to attempt to provide optimal difficulty:<br/>- rigorously prep encounters and railroad like crazy (no good for sandbox)<br/>- rigorously prep for everything the players might possibly do and set them free (takes forever, burns out GM)<br/>- take stuff that other people have prepped (i.e. modules) and plop it into a sandbox (just be sure to pick good modules, and provide enough info for players to meaningfully choose between them)<br/>- total or partial ad lib (that's what this thread is about)\n<blockquote>The more time and effort a GM or player uses to create something for the game, the more attached they grow to it and the more payback they want from that investment. The more payback they want from it, the more prone they are to use railroading techniques. The more they use railroading, the higher the chance of misuse.</blockquote>Agreed.  That's is a technique appropriate to dungeon crawls, where the players opt in to a physical railroad of "next room; next room; next room".  No GM manipulation required!  You entered the dungeon!<br/><br/>For sandbox it sucks.\n<blockquote>You're right about Collaboration.

For me, it's easy to talk about "let's all play nice together", because I can make that work with my buddies, but I realize that's not always a good approach.  It seems you have an instructive in-between -- a mix of people who totally <i>do</i> have fun together, but totally <i>do not</i> simply follow a game's advice about how they're supposed to play.<br/><br/>So, what are some of the sources of fun that "approach this as a collaboration" tends to stifle?  Is there any way to reduce that opposition, so you can collaborate <i>without</i> losing that fun?\n<blockquote>For a game with a flexible agenda between competition and collaboration you'll find a moment for each one, though you will need coordinating a set of techniques that allow players to discern when is being applied one or the other.

"When does which principle apply?"  Ideally, I think the answer is to define the principles without dissonance, such that it isn't a matter of "collaborate <i>or</i> compete" but rather you're <i>always doing both</i>, and the game helps you see where to look for each to make sure neither is being violated.  I mean, that's the way I see it already.  Is it possible for advice or principles or procedures or rules or rewards to make others see it that way too?<br/><br/>Some folks in this thread are claiming that certain principles in the Apocalypse World book might help, and I agree.  As long as the GM knows how to synergize "be a fan" with providing challenges, "be a fan of the characters" is great.  "Look through crosshairs" is also a useful tool, and I'm sure there are more.<br/><br/>Some of the stuff I use for Delve certainly applies, like "make sure everyone has all the relevant info to make decisions from".  This is not a GM job or a player job, but an "everybody" job -- we're all doing this for each other, because we all want a fair and informed competitive arena.  There's something else I use for Delve, which I wish I could implement here, but I think it kills some of the fun for WarriorMonk's group: "GM preps challenges, and then in play upholds what's prepped no matter what; beyond that, GM collaborates with the players to <i>help</i> them tackle those challenges, without ever doing it for them".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419344/#Comment_419344" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T20:08:35+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  8:08PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I've played AW and I've played challenge-based gaming, and I do not find the two to be remotely similar experiences, regardless of how the fictional transcripts may resemble each other. </blockquote>\nI'd like to throw in here. I agree with Dave: I don't understand how these two are similar at all. And yet I hear people talk about using World of Dungeons for an "old-school dungeon crawl", with a heavy Gamist approach, and I can't even imagine how that would work. Is it just a question of trying to roleplay cleverly enough to avoid rolling the dice? Because the mechanics themselves seem entirely disconnected from fictional-positioning-for-advantage. (With the exception of finding clever ways to use unusual moves, like <i>an arresting skinner</i> or WoD's magic.)<br/><br/>[If this is off-topic here, I can start a new thread.

Uh\u2014iunno.<br/><br/>Well, okay, let's say, in chess, White wins when Black loses, and vice versa. An advantage for White is a disadvantage for Black, and vice versa. Is that what we're talking about? Games where the GM wins when the players lose, and vice versa? Okay, AW isn't like that, but I didn't understand that from the context of example <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a>. If that's what we're talking about then, sure, my comparison wasn't apt. Sorry!<br/><br/>In Apocalypse World, the MC and the players have different objectives and agendas. They're not always mutually exclusive but they are in tension. So the MC, pursuing her agenda, is very often led into conflict with the players, pursing theirs. That's when the magic happens! Advantage for the MC is not necessarily disadvantage for the players, because the players don't necessarily lose when the MC nails her agenda. But the MC still has to wrestle for it, because it doesn't always directly serve the players' agenda to give it to her easily.<br/><br/>That seems to me to be true both of fictional positioning and game mechanical strategy. I mean, those are the same thing in AW. So, <a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">@Paul_T</a>, when you say,<blockquote>Because the mechanics themselves seem entirely disconnected from fictional-positioning-for-advantage.</blockquote>\u2014man, I just gotta say, that does not compute for me. The mechanics of AW directly plug into the fiction, and the MC's and the players' respective agendas are satisfied or frustrated there. Fictional positioning is where the game is happening, and it's where advantage is won or lost. Most fictional positioning has nothing to do with rolling the dice, but in AW, <i>every</i> roll of the dice results in a change in fictional positioning, and therefore advantage to the MC, or the PCs, or both, or neither.<br/><br/>All's I was saying before was, the MC is not "collaborating" with the players "to tell a story", as some games romantically portray their GM's role. The MC's job in AW is, expressly, to futz with the PCs. Not maliciously\u2014but, nevertheless, very, very aggressively.<br/><br/>Now, the story might be different if we were talking about a game where the GM or the players had extra-fictional objectives, and they had to jockey for advantage in the fiction in order to use moves that would give them extra-fictional benefits. Is that what we're talking about? Because that's not what I was talking about, but it is also super cool and I would love to hear more about that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_419348">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/419348/#Comment_419348" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-07-31T21:19:13+00:00" title="July 31, 2013  9:19PM">July 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            creases,<br/><br/>Basically, yes. The AW rules state certain things, like "getting into a straight-up fight is dangerous and you'll get hurt", and then they help conflicts and actions resolve into snowball effects which drive forward the story. The dice provide randomness we don't have a ton of control over.<br/><br/>It's pretty hard to use the system for one-upmanship, where you fight someone and we see that, "Hey, what a smart move! I didn't expect that combination: I guess you found a way to make violence in Apocalypse World to be quite safe after all!" As you say, it's never clear that *someone won*; it's not really an outcome which we can easily strive toward in that game. For instance, when you roll a failure (or a 7-9), you don't get a sinking feeling that you're not playing the game well and that's why you're losing. It's not what the game is optimized to deliver.<br/><br/>I may be explaining it very poorly. I hope Dave will come and do it better, as he usually does!

AW's principles are the proof of that. Principles help the GM focus better on using techniques that optimize the game flow, though probably he learned those techniques somewhere else or extrapolated them from the book examples and by trial and error on the game, if he hadn't any previous experience with RPGs. Now I consider Principles a must for every RPG design, but the Techniques are still missing, and both should be enforced as <i>game rules</i> and not as<i> game advice.</i>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>You're right about Collaboration. It's part of every single game, on it's most basic form as a way to level everybody to the same situation to start the game fairly. Now, asking players more than that requires a different approach to the definition of the game and limiting what's going to be fun about it and what not.</blockquote>I'd like to hear more about this in your group.  For me, it's easy to talk about "let's all play nice together", because I can make that work with my buddies, but I realize that's not always a good approach.  It seems you have an instructive in-between -- a mix of people who totally <i>do</i> have fun together, but totally <i>do not</i> simply follow a game's advice about how they're supposed to play.<br/><br/>So, what are some of the sources of fun that "approach this as a collaboration" tends to stifle?  Is there any way to reduce that opposition, so you can collaborate <i>without</i> losing that fun? </blockquote>\nTo reduce opposition I'd need really good examples of why is it fun to collaborate in X way, and why that fun is better than the fun I already have with other games. The examples should include the basic tools I need to make it work (the techniques) along with the game Principles -best if both are stated as game rules and not just game advice. Otherwise "Let's play nice" kind of advice sounds naive for a group bent on bringing up Competition when provoked, and keeping the right game flow for that kind of game looks like an impossible task for the GM of that group. Whenever the "fun intended for this game" seems unclear for either players or GMs, or difficult to achieve due to lack of proper techniques and/or, the current group's set of techniques is still being perceived as "more fun" or "able to breake the fun of another game", your chances of convincing that specific group will decrease.<br/><br/>"When does which principle apply?"  Ideally, I think the answer is to define the principles without dissonance, such that it isn't a matter of "collaborate <i>or</i> compete" but rather you're <i>always doing both</i>, and the game helps you see where to look for each to make sure neither is being violated.  I mean, that's the way I see it already.  Is it possible for advice or principles or procedures or rules or rewards to make others see it that way too?<br/><br/>Yes. I guess we should add a couple of principles to the list:<br/><br/>-Collaborate whenever you've got to do (whatever process in the game require this)<br/><br/>-You (can) compete for (whatever field of your game can handle this, being either the gamist challenge or verbal negotiation of advantages in the fiction)<br/><br/>I think that the questions we need fo focus on a bit are: What makes us compete? What makes us collaborate?<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
