The game is based on the <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=58815" rel="nofollow">Barbarians of Lemuria</a> system, but replicates the action of the men's adventure novels from the 1980s.  Right in my nostalgic sweet spot, in other words.  I knew as soon as I looked through the preview that it was something I wanted to have and run.  The sample characters include a ninja, for God's sake.  How could I resist that?<br/><br/>Anyway, I bought the thing and read through it and I feel like I can move forward running it for my gaming buddies on <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=11452" rel="nofollow"><a href="/forums/search?Search=%23playnow&amp;Mode=like">#playnow</a></a>.  The only problem: chargen.<br/><br/>Unlike a lot of the games we talk about and enjoy here at Story Games, <i>Dogs of W*A*R</i> has a pretty involved character generation system.  Now, if I were doing this for a tabletop group I'd just have the rules printed out and we'd share them around the table.  Obviously in an IRC situation I can't do that without duping copies of the PDF and distributing them, which butts up against copyright issues to which I'm quite sensitive, what with being in the copyright business myself.<br/><br/>I want people to be able to make the characters they want, so I don't want to force them to take pregens from the back of the book or ones I make myself.  I'd also like to give the players a chance to familiarize themselves with the basic rules before plunging into things.  I considered trying to distill things down enough to post a summary and let them work from there, but chargen is more complex than can be adequately covered that way and I don't want to just replicate everything in the book, which is just as bad.<br/><br/>So what are your thoughts?  Should I just share copies of the game and have done with it, or is there some kind of middle ground I could reach?  Should I give up even trying to run the game?  What?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255905">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255905/#Comment_255905" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T07:03:55+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  7:03AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Depending on your location (those of your players, actually), it might not be illegal for you to simply copy the pdf for them.

This won't work for all systems, so you have to figure out how to do it with this game. But, for illustration:<br><br>Imagine you're playing D&amp;D (something 3E-like). You can say, "Characters can be fighters, wizards, or thieves, in whatever proportion you like." You give each player 10 levels, they split them up between those classes as they wish (e.g. Fighter 8/Thief 2). They come up with the concept, then you finish up the specifics. <br><br>That's REALLY high-level. Zooming in, you could present packages of abilities, feats, equipment, relationships, whatever the game uses that are relevant to your game. For example, you could say, "One character can be a wizard from the Very Secret School". Who wants that bit? And the "wizard" package you've made has a selection of appropriate spells and a magical item, say. You also have a package like "Wild warrior", which is a list of feats relevant to such a character.<br><br>Maybe you have other such "packages", like "From the family of the deceased", which includes "I loved her like she was my sister 2d8" and the "Key of Endless Grief".<br><br>A player in your game might say, "OK, I want to play a Wild Warrior who is From the family of the deceased". And you just slap together those two packages. Voila, instant character.<br/><br/>For something like D&amp;D 3E this wouldn't be very practical (because it's complex and because character generation is a mini-game in itself), but for many games it could work really well, especially if it's a short-term game or a one-shot where characters need to be suitable for a specific scenario, situation, or challenge.<br/><br/>For instance, if you were playing TSoY, you could say something like: "OK, here is a relationship map. You can choose to be involved with any two NPCs." Players choose two each, and each relationship comes with a relevant Key, like a Key of Love for a love interest, or a Key of Revenge for a rival, maybe a Key of the Conspirator for the player who picks the relationship with the crazy underground spy rebel character.<br/><br/>That way, you can let the players design the character concepts and surprise you, but without necessarily having to know the system and the details of character generation.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_255948">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/255948/#Comment_255948" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-10T09:38:04+00:00" title="February 10, 2010  9:38AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My struggle with the PDF continues.

Then with a little reformatting, you can then convert that into a new PDF, with just the information you need.<br/>I typically do this when making player primers for games with very expensive e-books, or if they happen to be image-heavy. I also recently did that with some of the German-editions of Dungeon Slayers so I could translate them, as well as with portions of Danger Patrol, Danger Sxool, and Ghost/Echo, while working on some house-rule versions of them (many apologies, Master Harper!)<br/><br/>I also recently purchased Dogs of W*A*R, and can't wait to play it.

No matter how quirky it might seem, roleplayers in general do not, in principle, pay for anything. This is a general rule of thumb in the culture. Some individuals make exceptions; I know a few gamers who as a matter of course throw money at any game they want to play. The vast majority, however, presumes that they won't be paying anything for their gaming. If it comes down to a choice between paying or not playing, nine in ten roleplayers that I know of will choose to not play.<br/><br/>(In case you're wondering, the reason that games are sold at all is that some roleplayers - mostly GMs - like to buy games for ostensible future need - they do not buy them because they're planning to start a game tomorrow, but to read and plan and potentially introduce the game to their fellows later <i>if</i> they liked it themselves on the read-through. Thus games are really sold to be read, not to be played. Buying as a prerequisite for playing is something I've never encountered in the reality of the hobby.)<br/><br/>If you actually own a roleplaying game text you've bought yourself, you're already in the 10% hardcore of the hobby, is my experience. That's how I recognize the committed hardcore hobbyist: they're the ones who actually spend any money on the hobby. Sam's evidently in that group (as are most people on this forum), but it'd be pretty exceptional if all of his players were, too. Then again, who knows how the scene in Sam's crew. They might go for it, I don't know.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_256102">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour" title="FigureFour"><img alt="FigureFour" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FigureFour">FigureFour</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256102/#Comment_256102" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T05:39:46+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  5:39AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Then you've got poor students like me, who would love to be able to buy tons of games and/or go to the movies but can barely afford to eat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_256109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/256109/#Comment_256109" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-02-11T06:09:46+00:00" title="February 11, 2010  6:09AM">February 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, the best suggestion is to contact the publisher to ask them.<br/><br/>::Apparently Sam did just this, and the publisher said: "Hey, gimme a day and I'll send you a tailored PDF of the chargen section you can share with your group<br/>".

Awesome.</blockquote>\nThat is indeed awesome, and not surprising.  My experience in approaching independent publishers has also been positive; so I definitely have to echo the sentiment that the best course of action, at least initially, is to approach the publisher and see if they'll help you solve your problem.  Many of them will be only too happy to do so.<br/><br/>A while back, I bought a copy Black Cadillacs (Steel Toe'd edition) from Darcy Burgess - a singularly awesome book due to it's hefty handcrafted cover.  To my utter dismay, I lost the book when the backpack in which it resided was stolen.  I contacted Darcy to find out if he had any other copies of the book he was willing to part with, since at the time that I bought my first copy he mentioned he was down to his last couple of copies.  Sadly, he had already sold the last copy, but hearing my plight, he was kind enough to send me the PDF.<br/><br/>So it really does pay to contact the publisher if you've got a problem.  It will likely help solve your problem; but it will also provide insight to the publisher about something about their product that could be improved.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
