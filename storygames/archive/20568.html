Either what I've done is pretty cool or fucking crazy &amp; stupidly unwieldy, but I'll let you decide that.<br/><br/>So, here's the problem with Range and Superheroes. On the one hand, you got superheroes like The Flash, Superman, &amp; Silver Surfer. These people can move so fast they can travel through time. Nothing is out of Range for them, everything is just a few seconds away.  Then you have other Supers like Spider-man, Daredevil, &amp; Archangel. These guys have a pretty high degree of mobility as well, but clearly they cannot cover the crazy degree of space that the aforementioned heroes can. <br/><br/>Then you got people like Cyclops and Punisher. Cyclops can shoot Eye-beams from way far away, while Punisher shoots, ya know... regular guns. Sure, he'll pick up a sniper to increase his range, but the point is he works on a sliding scale.<br/><br/>The point of all this analysis is this: when you're making a game of Supers that includes the entire spectrum of powers and power levels (like I am), how do you define Range between opponents in a consistent fashion? Well, here's what I came up with.<br/><br/>Rather than describe Range as a qualitative or quantitative measure of distance, I decided to try and define it as a State of Being. <br/><br/>The idea is that your Range State describes what kinds of abilities you can use against an opponent and what they can use against you. It also describes a kind of direction of travel. Either circling around one another (whether that be in a crowded arena or among the stars), moving towards or away from an opponent, or completely out of range of one another and moving throughout that space. <br/><br/>I codified these as 3 different Range States. <br/><br/>Two opponents act:\n<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li><b>In Range</b> of one another - Both opponents can attack one another with their melee and ranged abilities.</li><li><b>Closer to/Further from</b> one another depending on the direction you're traveling.<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"> <li>You are moving <b>Closer to</b> your opponent. However, you're not Close enough to affect your opponent with your ranged or melee abilities. Likewise, your opponent cannot affect you with their ranged or melee abilities.</li><li>You are moving <b>Further away</b> from your Opponent. You've almost made it completely Out of Range of them and you cannot affect one another with Melee abilities. However, you can still affect one another with your ranged abilities.</li></ul></li><li><b>Out of Range</b> of one another - Neither opponent can attack one another with their melee or Ranged abilities.</li></ul>\nSo, you might be asking, why can you use your Ranged abilities when moving Further away from your opponent, but you can't do the same when moving Closer to your opponent?<br/><br/>I created this bizarre split to leave room to model characters that have some kind of reach ability. For example, someone who can stretch like Mr. Fantastic, or Storm who can pelt you with lightning bolts from the air. If you have a character like that in the mix, they take a Reach ability. Then, if you have someone like Superman who can laser eye you from the moon, you boost that ability so that it can be activated even when your character is considered Out of Range.  Well that was the thought. <br/><br/>Maybe it's better to say there are 4 Range states. When moving closer to your opponent, you've begun to close the distance but you're not quite close enough to use your abilities on them. When moving Further away from  your opponent, you've started to put some distance between you, but you haven't covered enough ground to be safe from one another's ranged attacks. Graphically, the Range states might be represented as follows.<br/><br/>In Range -----&gt;Further ------- Closer&lt;-------Out of Range<br/><br/>So, does any of this make sense? I'm starting to wonder if I made a broken unicorn that has value in some bizarre world where things like that matter. Honestly, I could just make it easy on myself and say there are only 3 Range bands:<br/>In Range - use melee and ranged abilities on one another<br/>Close - Can only use ranged abilities on one another<br/>Out of Range - Cannot use Ranged or Melee abilities on one another.<br/><br/>For some reason, I want the idea of Range States to work, but I'm not 100% sure how and when that would be relevant. Any thoughts, comments, suggestions, scathing criticisms?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451812/#Comment_451812" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-10T08:54:35+00:00" title="March 10, 2016  8:54AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Maybe you could tell us more about the game you're designing - the bigger picture.<br/>How much are fights between superheroes a main feature of the game?

To limit the PCs and make things interesting, even when players are using really fast characters, I still have them roll to see if they make it on time. <br/><br/>My general rule is:  If the PCs are prepared for something specific players don't need to roll for it; but besides that, no power or ability gives them an immediate, absolute nor automatic success. So my duty as a GM is to make things interesting either is the roll is good or bad. No roll result is a "you miss/the opponen misses and nothing happens".<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451816">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451816/#Comment_451816" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-10T17:23:18+00:00" title="March 10, 2016  5:23PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2016 5:35PM by Luzelli.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Maybe you could tell us more about the game you're designing - the bigger picture.<br/>How much are fights between superheroes a main feature of the game?

Whether either works and which works better really depends on other details such as, for example, how do you <i>change</i> your range-state relative to another character?</blockquote>\nSure, I can give this a shot. The game is heavily inspired by Wushu, so combat is intended to be a rather large feature of things. The intention is for players to be a team of Supers taking on classic Super threats. The resolution mechanics tend to focus on: "What was the mental, emotional, and physical toll of dealing with that threat?" The system is probably best equipped to handle a four-colored Supers game that's heavy on the soap-opera type drama of comic books --rather than something exceedingly dark and noir-y. <br/><br/>Players can make characters that fit anywhere across the spectrum of superhero types (Punisher to Superman) and they can all fight alongside one another and against one another without feeling too restricted. Ultimately, what you can do with your Super is limited by your narrative capability.<br/><br/>To that end, Powers creation is left fairly open. Players give a brief description of their power (Psionic Ability, Controls the Elements, Master of Magnetism) and then attach a few control elements to that description. The control elements give the power description discrete mechanical effects. For example, attaching Accuracy gives you the ability to increase your Target Number by a certain amount. <br/><br/>When it's time for a Super-Brawl, players are looking to do a couple things: <br/>Narrate a host of actions to Increase their Target Number (TN) while<br/>Narrating a host of actions to Decrease their opponent's TN.<br/><br/>How you accomplish this is determined by the fictional circumstances and how you narrate using your powers to exploit weakness and hinder the enemy. Everything a player narrates on their turn happens as they narrate it. So players and the GM have to dance around each other's narration to continually hammer at their opponents during a fight.<br/><br/>For example\n<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Cyclops is fighting Juggernaut (both <i>Out of Range</i>).</li><li><b>Round 1:</b> Jugs takes a hit of super serum to bolster his strength, starts charging towards Cyclops and throws a car at him because he has Reach. Cyclops responds with an eye-blast that shatters the car (he's also got Reach). Both are considered <i>Closer to</i> one another. Jugs is closing the gap, Cyclops didn't elect to move one way or another.</li><li><b>Round 2:</b> Jugs slams into Cyclops driving him through a building (moved <i>In Range</i>). Cyclops responds by cutting the ground away from Jugs and grabbing onto the floor while Jugs falls through. Technically, Cyclops' player used his action to move <i>Further away</i>. Fictionally, Cyclops did this by cutting the ground away from his opponent. Thus, they both share this range state relative to one another.</li><li><b>Round 3:</b> Jugs falls through the floor into the parking garage. Jugs hurls another car at the dangling Cyclops, and then continues bashing through the garage floor towards the Morlock tunnels (moved <i>Out of Range</i>). Whoops, Cyclops just lost track of the enemy, but the fight's not over. He can give chase if he wants, which would mean he steps back <i>Closer towards</i> Jugs. But first, he's gotta deal with another vehicle coming at his face.</li></ul>\nIn a round, unless you have super speed or something like that, you can move from one range state to another. Whether you start the fight In or Out of Range depends on circumstances surrounding that scene. But from that point on, you can only cross from one range state into another in one round. If you start at Out of Range, you move through the sequence by stepping Closer to the target and then moving In Range of the target. If you start In Range of a target, you first move Further away before you can get completely Out of Range.<br/><br/>Out of Range -----&gt;Closer towards ------------------------&gt;In Range <br/>Out of Range &lt;------------------------Further Away &lt;-------In Range<br/><br/>Did that help explain how things are intended to go? Combat is certainly a large part of the game. Probably 80-90%. I noticed that the rules system does allow for players to be villains. But it was always intended that they would be &lt;u&gt;Superheros, in the truest sense; with all those great moral codes and haunted pasts. Meanwhile, the GM gives them fun and classic feeling Supervillains to tangle with. From the megalomaniacal variety to the tortured Anti-hero who could be a good-guy if he'd just stop his crazy ways (looking at you Magneto).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rafu" title="Rafu"><img alt="Rafu" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/420/n28FOVWJG2JK7.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rafu">Rafu</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451826/#Comment_451826" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-10T23:23:56+00:00" title="March 10, 2016 11:23PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So, based on what you describe, "range" could theoretically just be folded into "Narrating"\u2026 Why did you choose to single out Range, specifically, to be an explicit mechanical constraint?

The name sounds familiar, but until you posted that comment I never really knew anything about it. That's an interesting way of looking at Range, and it's certainly something I'm considering trying. If nothing else, it is much easier to understand and quickly explain to a group of players.<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">@WarriorMonk</a> Yeah, I'm really struggling with how abstract I want positioning to be. A lot of this came from me trying to reconcile how you can have Spider-Man help the avengers fight Galactus... or other similar conflicts. In epic battles like that, you have a multitude of Heroes who operate on vastly different scales, and yet they're all able to contribute in some meaningful way. <br/><br/>The easiest way to tackle this is to simply say, "well, some Heroes are more Super than others, and they will just annihilate you." While that's certainly true, I worry that it makes for a less than ideal play situation. I was hoping to create a way for <b>any</b> hero concept to be a valid tool to use in a fight. That way, the person playing Daredevil doesn't feel like she's being outclassed by the girl playing Thor (even though that is what would happen).\n<blockquote> Why did you choose to single out Range, specifically, to be an explicit mechanical constraint?</blockquote>\nTravel-based superheroes, like The Flash or Quicksilver. This is the only reason why I decided Range should be a mechanical thing. The very core of these Supers is that they can cover a distance faster than anyone else on the battlefield. Sure, they can also accomplish tasks quickly, etc. But in a battle, their main asset is that they can zip in and out of range of you, often faster than you can reconcile. <br/><br/>Building off that idea, I tried to categorize specific facets of different types of superpowers and then give them a truly mechanical effect. For example, take the case of truly hardy heroes (Colossus, Wolverine, etc.), I figured their big gimmick is that they're tough to put down. Sure, they have other abilities and those are also important, but a fair number of Hero concepts come from the idea of a nigh indestructible Super that is just very hard to put down. To mechanize this element, I said they can take an ability that gives them a sudden large burst of HP. In essence, you have to work a lot harder to break past this cushion and whittle them down like everyone else.\n<blockquote> And which other features of a superpower's description get a similar treatment (for example, do you have "elemental rock-paper-scissor", or a sliding scale of super-strength)?</blockquote>\nThis is a pretty good question, but I'm not certain how to answer it without giving you a bit more detail about super power construction. Forgive the incredible amount of text, still working this all out:\n<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>All Super Powers are defined by a <b>Descriptor</b> &amp; a number of <b>Effects</b> attached to that descriptor. Descriptors are an almost entirely narrative construct (they do have a mechanical purpose though). Effects (FX) are almost entirely mechanical in nature, they define how you can use your Super Power to mess with your opponent in the Game part of the RPG.</li><li>A power Descriptor is a short phrase such as: Controls the Elements, Super Agility, Enhanced Senses, Shoots Eye Beams, Psionic Abilities, etc.</li><li>Each Descriptor has a Rating, from 1-10. This would be the sliding scale that determines which Super Speed based character is faster and which Super Strength character is stronger. Furthermore, your Descriptor Rating determines how many different Effects (FX) you can attach to the Descriptor. For example, Super Speed Rated at 3, means you can attach 3 different mechanical benefits to your power by way of FX.</li><li>Effects (FX) both give your power a discrete mechanical benefit and also describe a specific application of your power that you are very well versed in. For example, one of the FX is Ensnare, which lets you levy a mechanical penalty on your opponent when you use the Power to wrap them up in vines or run super fast around them and tie them up. You can still fictionally ensnare a target without having this FX attached to your Descriptor. And the opponent will have to do something to deal with it, but they won't get that specific mechanical penalty, so it will be easier to break the Ensnare.</li></ul>\nOk, with that out there, I used the FX to mechanize all the unique aspects of Supers. I tried to make them broad enough to be usable across multiple different Hero concepts. For example, both Colossus and Wolverine would have the Effect Resilience. When Colossus invokes the Effect it might be attached to the Descriptor (Steel Skin), while Wolverine might use the Descriptor (Healing Factor). FX also act as a way to differentiate two Heroes that have similar power-sets. For example, both Blasto and Red Eye have an Energy Blast type of descriptor. But Blasto took the FX Accurate while Red Eye took Relentless. This means Blasto's Energy Blasts are akin to precision sniper shots, while Red Eye's Relentless indicates that his Energy Blasts are more destructive in nature and probably cause a lot of collateral damage.<br/><br/>In regards to rock-paper-scissor, I decided against going that route. Instead, I said that the real way to win a fight is to bombard your enemy with narrative traps. I call these <b>Environmental Factors</b>. They can be things like:<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>changing the shape of the terrain (lava pools, crashing buildings)</li> <li>Physically hindering a character (tying them up, trapping them under rubble, etc.)</li><li>Morally hindering a character (holding an innocent hostage,  forcing Magneto to abandon one of the mutants that have taken his protection).</li></ul>\nAll of these kinds of things can be invoked to levy a penalty or give yourself a bonus unless they're somehow resolved or removed from the conflict. I've been told this functions a lot like how Fate handles Aspects (but I never finished reading that, so I can't comment). Hammering an opponent with Environmental Factors and your own Effects will ultimately fatigue their capabilities and tilt the odds in your favor. <br/><br/>So, I've gotten a bit off track from your question, but that's how I've mechanized Super abilities. Very few of them are tied to the usual kind of RPG constraints. But if I had to give a list of mechanical considerations that players take into account when choosing actions you have:<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Range - Are you within range of your opponent to hassle them with your abilities?</li><li>Energy Pool - essentially a fatigue mechanic that dictates the number of different FX you can invoke in a round.

The fictional character actions sound fun, but I can't tell how range considerations are impacting them.  If you could write the exact same example, but make it about Cyclops's <i>player</i> and Juggernaut's <i>player</i>, and what they're thinking as they decide which character actions to take, then I'd know the role you envision for Range.<br/><br/>If that's too much effort, then let me just hazard a guess -- you want range to be a constraint/springboard for players as they're choosing character actions.  Basically, versions of, "I want to get closer, therefore I'll choose an action that attempts to achieve that," or, "I can't just use my Uber Punch again because this time I'm out of range, so I'll have to come up with something else."<br/><br/>Whether I'm right or wrong, I'm guessing this is the <i>type</i> of info we'll need in order to be able to give you useful suggestions.  Can you fill us in?</blockquote>\nHeh, after reading this, I realize that I did not understand the intent of Rafu's question. But I think I got a better handle on this now. Of course, I regret writing that crazy wall of text, but oh well.<br/><br/>Let me start by dissecting that play example:\n<ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Cyclops is fighting Juggernaut. The GM tells Bort, who's controlling Cyclops, that the two characters are currently <b>Out of Range</b> and Juggernaut has the drop on him, so the GM takes his turn first.</li><li><b>Round 1:</b> <i>Jugs takes a hit of super serum to bolster his strength, starts charging towards Cyclops and throws a car at him.</i> <br/>The GM knows the two characters are out of range so he activates the Accurate ability (super serum) which increases his TN by 2 for the exchange (spending 2 Energy to do so). He then charges forward, moving (1 Energy, Move) <b>Closer</b> to bring himself in range to throw a car at Cyclops (2 Energy, Reach ability). 7 Energy Spent.<br/><i>Cyclops responds with an eye-blast that shatters the car.</i><br/>Bort doesn't want to drop too much Energy this early on, so he plays it safe. Bort spends 1 Energy, the minimum buy-in to start doing shit, and activates a Defensive ability (2 Energy), which lowers the GM's TN back down. Remember, the GM had just raised it earlier with the Super Serum. 3 Energy Spent.<br/><br/>At this point, Jugs and Cyclops are considered moving <b>Closer to</b> one another. The GM is closing the gap, Bort didn't elect to move one way or another.</li><li><b>Round 2:</b> <i>Jugs slams into Cyclops driving him through a building.</i><br/>The Gm dropped a lot of Energy last round, so he eases back. The GM spends 1 Energy &amp; moves <b>In Range</b> and drops another 2 Energy to activate the Ensnare ability (the slam). This ability forces Cyclops to burn 2 Energy or be unable to move for the rest of the sequence. 3 Energy Spent.<br/> <br/><i>Cyclops responds by cutting the ground away from Jugs and grabbing onto the floor while Jugs falls through.</i><br/>Bort has far more ranged ability than the GM. Juggernaut can do horrible shit up close, but he's far more limited when it comes to ranged attacks. Knowing this, Bort decides to drop 1 Energy to move Further away from Jugs. However, since the GM used Ensnare, he's forced to spend another 2 Energy as a part of his move. This allows him to end the Ensnare and narrate moving <b>Further away</b> from Jugs. At this Range, Bort can attack Jugs far more effectively than the GM can respond because only ranged abilities can be used when in the <b>Further away</b> range state. With this in mind, Bort attacks and burns 3 Energy on the Accurate Ability to raise his TN by 3.  Fictionally, Cyclops did all this by cutting the ground away from his opponent, dropping him down one level. 6 Energy Spent.</li><li><b>Round 3:</b> <i>Jugs falls through the floor into the parking garage. Jugs hurls another car at the dangling Cyclops, and then continues bashing through the garage floor towards the Morlock tunnels.</i> <br/>The GM knows Jugs has burned a lot of energy on this fight. He's running pretty low. Rather than do anything too over the top, he does one parting shot. He activates Accurate (2 Energy, raises TN 2 points) and Reach (2 Energy) and then spends 1 Energy on moving <b>Out of Range</b>. 5 Energy Spent. <br/><br/>To accomplish just the attack portion of this action he had to burn 4 Energy. In doing so, the GM could only raise his TN 2 points. Meanwhile, from the same range, Bort was able to raise his TN 3 points and only spent 3 Energy to do it. This is why the GM decides to have Jugs book it to a different location: when two characters are in the <b>Further away</b> range state, the one with the better ranged abilities has an advantage. However, when two characters are moving Closer towards one another, neither one has covered enough distance to outright attack one another with ranged abilities for free. Both parties would have to burn 2 Energy to activate Reach and then they could tear into each other with Ranged attacks.<br/><br/>In the final tally, the GM spent 15 Energy and Bort Spent 9. Starting Heroes only have 10 Energy Points, so Bort only has 1 Energy left to do something. Once you're out of Energy, you can't take any more actions in the sequence of combat. Bort could spend the 1 Energy to defend against the car by rolling away or he could use the 1 Energy to move <b>Closer</b> to Juggernaut, hoping that he doesn't have any Energy left to attack again.</li></ul>\nHopefully, that helps expand on why I decided to make Range a mechanically important consideration in the game. At the end of the day, your big bottleneck in combat is: how much Energy do I have to spend on Actions. Likewise, how can you force the enemy to expend more Energy to achieve a desired effect. Once you can tire someone's Energy out, they can't narrate actions for the rest of the Sequence. You could, theoretically, just go balls out on them at that point and really fuck 'em up.<br/><br/>The minimum buy-in to perform any actions during a sequence is 1 Energy Point. Spending that 1 Point allows you to: Attack, Move, Defend, and Interact with something in the Environment in a meaningful way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451831/#Comment_451831" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-11T05:13:19+00:00" title="March 11, 2016  5:13AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2016 5:37AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's a great write-up!  <br/><br/>My thoughts on Range:<br/><br/>Range clearly matters for color, in the form of which moves I can do, like whether I get to Ensnare or not.  <br/><br/>I don't see from your example how Range matters tactically, since all the actions you list seem to have a 1:1 ratio of "spend energy" to "improve target number", but I could be missing something.  If I'm not missing anything, and you do want it to matter tactically, then I'd recommend writing some moves that are more or less Energy-efficient, e.g. sniping from great range costs 2 Energy to reduce opponent TN by 1, or uppercutting at close range costs 1 Energy to reduce opponent TN by 2, so you have outcome-related incentives to care what range you're at.  <br/><br/>(In some games, range incentives are a problem, with a boring series of simultaneous "Jugs charges Cyke" and "Cyke backs away from Jugs" actions which just maintain the extant range.  But your sequential narration, where I can simply declare a changed Range on my turn if I can pay for it, seems to solve that problem.)<br/><br/>Even with variably Energy-efficient moves, combat still might be a bit solvable and deterministic, but if you don't like that I see plenty of options for tweaks, including using Range.  For example, maybe a Move action's Energy cost or number of Range increments traversed depends on a die roll.<br/><br/>Anyway, speculation aside, I think your concept of Range as a State (much like a Condition in many games) makes a lot of sense.  I think the names you picked are extremely confusing, though!  I understand your original post a <b>lot</b> better after that last example.<br/><br/>Here's what I'd do:\n<blockquote>Anything a character can do is either a <b>Reach</b> move, a <b>Close</b> move, or a <b>Reach Or Close</b> move.  (Fictionally, I think some Reach moves work up close and some don't.)<br/><br/>There are 3 range increments: <b>Out of Reach</b>, <b>At Reach</b>, and <b>Close</b>.<br/><br/>You don't need names for different types of movement -- <b>Move</b> covers it, and then the player will name the new range.  "I Move to At Reach", "I Move to Close", etc.</blockquote>\nSimple!<br/><br/>This is certainly not a fine-grained simulation of range, but your hypothetical play example doesn't strike me as being concerned with such things.  Once I can achieve a thing simply because it's my turn and I pay the Energy cost, I think fine-grained simulation in general goes out the window.  That's definitely a matter of taste, but simplicity looks like it fits, in my eyes.<br/><br/>(If you ever want to simulate a character power whose range is way better than an opponent's also-high-ranged power, then just create a 4th move type, the <b>Out of Reach</b> move.  But I'm guessing such things aren't actually suitable to fun combats of the type you've presented.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451832/#Comment_451832" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-11T05:26:53+00:00" title="March 11, 2016  5:26AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Separately, your spend-based combat reminds me of exactly one other system, so I'll mention and link it in case you're interested: <a href="http://www.fatestorm.com/index.php/intro-to-fatestorm/" rel="nofollow">FateStorm</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451834">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli" title="Luzelli"><img alt="Luzelli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Luzelli">Luzelli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451834/#Comment_451834" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-11T07:02:56+00:00" title="March 11, 2016  7:02AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Here's what I'd do:\n<blockquote>Anything a character can do is either a <b>Reach</b> move, a <b>Close</b> move, or a <b>Reach Or Close</b> move.

I really like the reach, close, out of reach method (90% sure I'm going to steal it). Very elegantly explains what I'm trying to get at. Like you mentioned, I really disliked the old terminology I was using, but couldn't figure a better way to explain it.\n<blockquote>Range clearly matters for color, in the form of which moves I can do, like whether I get to Ensnare or not.<br/>...<br/>I'd recommend writing some moves that are more or less Energy-efficient, e.g. sniping from great range costs 2 Energy to reduce opponent TN by 1, or uppercutting at close range costs 1 Energy to reduce opponent TN by 2, so you have outcome-related incentives to care what range you're at.  <br/><br/>Even with variably Energy-efficient moves, combat still might be a bit solvable and deterministic, but if you don't like that I see plenty of options for tweaks, including using Range.

But, one of my goals was to keep the player constantly asking one question: <blockquote>How can I activate these abilities to boost my TN while lowering my enemy's TN.</blockquote>\nLooking at Wushu, I noticed that players only ever worried about how they could get more dice to roll. They were constantly asking themselves, how can I narrate more to give myself enough dice to be effective. I tried to mimic that concept in a different way:<blockquote>How can I narrate myself into a position to use one of these moves that lets me modify TN.</blockquote> My hope is, by giving them <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> one really important mechanical consideration to worry about, they're freed to dive into the narrative and let all the other things slide.<br/><br/>All this to say, you're right, things boil down to <b>Spend Energy</b> &amp; <b>Modify TN</b>. The different abilities are all structured around affecting one of those two factors. <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Some abilities force the opponent to spend more energy. Others allow <b>you</b> to spend less.</li><li>Meanwhile, some abilities modify <b>your</b> TN while others modify your opponent's TN.</li></ul>\nNow that you mention it, I realize Range related abilities don't actually do either of those things. Instead, Range related abilities let you do one of two tangentially related things:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>Move through all of the range bands within in the scope of 1 Round. Meaning you could attack from Close and then immediately zip to Out of Reach.</li><li>Affect a target with your abilities from a greater distance. In this case it would be At Reach.</li></ol>\nAn argument could be made that the first one in that list has an effect on Energy expenditure, but only incidentally. Perhaps I should tie things in more tightly with Spend Energy &amp; Modify TN. If I understand your suggestion correctly, I should probably re-frame those Range abilities as having a clear effect on the two variables <b>Spend Energy</b> &amp; <b>Modify TN</b>.<br/><br/>Side-note: I was actually considering letting you upgrade Reach to affect people from any Range (i.e. Superman lasering you from the moon). Don't know how cool that would be to play with/against though.<br/><br/>As for the solvability of combat.. that's kind of a problem I'm still trying to work on. Since I'm trying to steal from Wushu (specifically the Jedi hack), I'm trying hard to keep rolling completely out of it until the very end of the Sequence. Consequently, the procedure for combat is: all the PCs and NPCs take turns narrating actions against one another sequentially and then collectively roll off to decide the overall impact the exchange has on the participants; psychologically. <br/><br/>After that whole back and forth between Jugs and Cyke, the two roll off. The winner of the conflict deals damage to the opponent's morale. This gives rise to three possible outcomes: <ol style="list-style-type: decimal;"><li>no one wins (everyone is still game to duke it out)</li><li>one person wins (Cyke overwhelms Jugs, causing Jugs to question whether or not he can survive this encounter)</li><li>They both win (both Jugs and Cyke dish out some serious pain, and both parties are starting to doubt that they'll make it through this fight ok)</li> </ol> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_451835">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451835/#Comment_451835" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-11T08:17:52+00:00" title="March 11, 2016  8:17AM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 11, 2016 8:35AM by David_Berg.">edited March 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>I really like the reach, close, out of reach method (90% sure I'm going to steal it).</blockquote>Yay!\n<blockquote>How can I narrate myself into a position to use one of these moves that lets me modify TN?</blockquote>\nI suspect the player questions in your current system would be something like:\n<blockquote>How can I narrate myself into a position to use <i>the</i> move I feel like using flavor-wise?<br/><br/>How can I narrate myself into a position to use <i>any</i> move?</blockquote>\nAs far as I can tell, "move that does a specific thing" isn't really a tactical concern.  I'm not seeing a difference between "I add to my own TN" and "I lower your TN" in any tactical sense.  If we're proceeding until someone runs out, then my choice there just changes the pace, not the victor.  Maybe I'm missing something, though.<br/><br/>I think it's cool that you're trying to keep dice out of the bulk of the action, but if you want tactics to matter, then players' action decisions need to feed back into <i>something</i> other than the pace at which we run out of TN.  <br/><br/>Maybe some sort of scoring results from our uses of different actions at different ranges, and this scoring influences the final roll at the end?  Or maybe certain relationships between opponents' TNs or Energy levels shake things up?  Like triggering the final roll prematurely, before anyone's TN hits 0?  Just brainstorming here.  I dunno if these ideas are any better on the "only one consideration to worry about" front than my variable Energy-efficiency one.\n<blockquote>If I understand your suggestion correctly, I should probably re-frame those Range abilities as having a clear effect on the two variables <b>Spend Energy</b> &amp; <b>Modify TN</b>.</blockquote>\nWell, if Energy spent to TN adjusted is always 1 to 1, then I'd say that ultimately Range is pure color and doesn't need any extra framing for the players beyond what it means fictionally.<br/><br/>But if you're talking about framing it in your own head for your design process, then yeah, thinking in E and TN sounds wise to me!  In my head, that invariably leads to the dynamic I proposed -- changing Ranges maneuvers you between low-E/TN and high-E/TN options -- but maybe you can think of something you like better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_451836">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/451836/#Comment_451836" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-03-11T16:47:00+00:00" title="March 11, 2016  4:47PM">March 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's a thought for a simple range consideration:<br/><br/>In any given fight, either the opponents are on equal ground, or one is significantly faster than the other.<br/><br/>That effects that costs or dangers of adjusting the range between you two.
