However, failure happens, and when it does, be prepared to describe the results.<br/><br/>An easy way to describe failure is with a \u201cwhiff\u201d. <br/><i>* \u201cHe evaded, so your sword swing missed.\u201d<br/>* \u201cYou can\u2019t convince the monk to let you into the cloister.\u201d<br/>* \u201cYou failed at healing the samurai\u2019s wounds.\u201d<br/>* \u201cYou tried to forge a security pass, but don\u2019t succeed.\u201d</i><br/><br/>The above failures are all fine: Sometimes a failure is just a failure. However, don\u2019t get stuck in the trap of thinking that all failures represent some failing of the character\u2019s ability or skill. Through describing the failure, you can create failure events that take into consideration the character\u2019s skill, but in the end the task failed because of some event outside of the character that the character can\u2019t control. For example, to re-describe the above four failures in a way that doesn\u2019t involve simple \u201cwhiffing\u201d:<br/><br/><i>* \u201cYour sword strikes true, impaling his throat on its sharp tip... or wait? What is this? For any other man, he\u2019d be skewered at the end of your sword as you just saw in your mind\u2019s eye. But because of his superior training, he threw himself backwards out of harm\u2019s way just as your blade pierced the air where he stood moments ago.\u201d<br/>* \u201cYou seem to get through to the monk, expressing your urgency. He seems to hesitate for a moment, and that\u2019s when the head abbot appears behind him from the courtyard and clears his throat. Feeling the abbot\u2019s glare on the back of his neck, he slowly turns back to you, a tear of sweat rolling down his cheek, and firmly tells you that no one is allowed in the cloister.\u201d<br/>* \u201cThese wounds... that bizarre annelid has some kind of rending mandible you\u2019ve never seen before. You\u2019ve never seen wounds like this, and your traditional healing skills haven\u2019t prepared you for treating this kind of wound. You do what you can, but you fear it\u2019s not enough.\u201d<br/>* \u201cYou successfully forged your pass the day before and are now in line at the Gate of Lions, awaiting inspection. As your hand moves over the folded paper in your pocket, you happen to glance over your shoulder at the family in front of you: Their pass seems to have a different format than yours. You glance back nonchalantly and happen to see the pass of a merchant behind you, which confirmed your nagging suspicion. Damn, they must have recently changed the format for the security passes in this district. If you walk to the gate holding this forged piece of paper, you\u2019ll be arrested for sure.\u201d</i><br/><br/>The characters still fail, but the failures can be more interesting, lead to more detail, and allow the characters to fail for reasons outside of their character, rather than \u201ctheir skill wasn\u2019t good enough\u201d. Still, a \u201creal failure\u201d/\u201dwhiff\u201d every now and then can also keep the characters grounded in reality: They don\u2019t have to be Awesome, All The Time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231096/#Comment_231096" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T08:33:49+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  8:33AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 8:34AM by Thunder_God.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I got introduced to it in the manner of "Yes, but..." mostly. InSpectres, Burning Wheel, online discussion regarding such? Been years.<br/><br/>If failure would stop the story, then it's not a good thing. Some people say, if the result is not going to be interesting in one direction (if you fail/succeed), just have the character do what leads to the interesting side. But interesting is subjective, and it's a bit too fiat-esque for me if it doesn't come from a system where the players discuss the outcomes.<br/><br/>To me, if the character needs to steal a car for the game to remain interesting, then they'd steal the car, even if they fail to circumvent the security system, but just that the security system would send their data to their opposition, perhaps unknown to them. Or in other words, failure is not the inability to obtain your goal, but a complication added along the way.<br/><br/>I mostly see the "Yes, and..." for partial success. But I think in many cases it is also relevant for outright failures.<br/>As for sword-swings, hm. If the game's fight is resolved in 3-4 swings, I can see each getting a flowery description, but it's tiring if it's high level DnD, and you're going to make a couple dozen attack rolls.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231100">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ColinC" title="ColinC"><img alt="ColinC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ColinC">ColinC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231100/#Comment_231100" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T08:39:58+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  8:39AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 8:40AM by ColinC.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>1 and 2)</i><br/><br/>I like to add complications, up the danger, or kick the story in a different direction. <br/><br/>For example, in the case of trying to convince the monk to let you into the cloister: Not only can you not get in, now the abbot now knows that you're nosing around and will be sending some very special friends of his to visit you at the teahouse tonight.<br/><br/>I really like Andy's "failure adds detail" technique.

"An expert doctor, but the standard Fudge rules, fails a simple appendix surgery once out of every (x%) times. That's preposterous and unbelievable! So I used 3dF, which allows for less such variance" This stuck in my head for a bit, and I wouldn't be able to address why until later.<br/><br/>2) RPGNet. There was some huge discussion back in 1999-2000 or so where the topic creeped up, and I think people posted examples of how critical failure happened in their games where the player didn't just "whiff".<br/><br/>3) Justin Bacon's article years ago for SJ Weekly on "Dice of Destiny", where you basically use dice as oracles, and failure could be because (as the dice read) "you don't have the skill" (a classic whiff), or "you didn't have enough time", or "there were factors outside your control", or "your gear wasn't enough" and the like. This got the wheels turning more.<br/><br/>4) The solidifier was FURTHER discussions on RPGNet, at around the same time that I read... I think it was Sorcerer and Sword(?) or Sorcerer, one of the two, that addressed this very issue: "What happens when your glib smooth-talker botches his roll to make a toast?" Classic whiff is "Har har you spill the wine everywhere and fall down you doofus." But the text gave examples of environmental factors that led to the failure (I don't remember them now, if someone does and wants to chime in; but basically in the other examples it was the PC who was doing things fine, but circumstances out of the PCs control caused the botch). <br/><br/>5) And yet further discussions on the topic at RPGNet. I had a standard message/screed about 2 pages long that I actually at one point had saved as a macro (because the topic came up with regularity), and both hearing folks' light bulb brains go off, plus hearing folks' positive experiences with this kind of thing, led me to conclude that we were on the right track.<br/><br/>In the end, there's gotta be some whiffs. You can't be awesome All The Time. But making failures interesting and exciting (and yeah, Guy, a lot of it is saying to the player, "Nope it didn't work; tell me how or why you failed.") has been a cornerstone of my GMing for a long time now.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231110">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Valamir" title="Valamir"><img alt="Valamir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Valamir">Valamir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231110/#Comment_231110" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T08:49:32+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  8:49AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy does your game also suggest / allow for / feature the "Failure as Success but with Consequences" technique?<br/>\n<br/>\nFrex:  "Initially the monk seemed adamant about not letting you into the Cloister, but eventually your sincerity and urgency convinced him of your need and he relented.

In the Burning games, as I'm sure we're all aware, ensuring *something* happens regardless of the roll outcome is also baked deep into the core procedures of the game (ie Let it Ride, Say Yes or Roll, etc.)<br><br>Tricks and angles I've messed with both in BW and other games:<br><br>* Extract the interesting failure from the character's own flags. In BW this is Traits; in Reign, I think I used Mission and stuff like that. I like this because even failure is a recapitulation of the character's identity -- he failed *because* he's "greedy" or whatever. The downside is that it makes for a pretty hyperfocused game without much room for organic growth.<br><br>* Allow the task to succeed brilliantly, but frustrate the intent. This is a fairly standard BW strategy, and nicely sidesteps the "why would an expert just whiff?" problem. Sometimes it takes some mental acrobatics to twist up the intent even as the task is succeeding, but IMO this is just an actor/author perspective trick that's learnable.<br/><br/>* Extending from the previous one (and extrapolating from BW's Circles mechanic, MG, Gumshoe, etc.), allow the task to succeed but make it cost something. So now the roll isn't about whether you succeed or not, but what, if anything, it'll cost when you do.<br/><br/>p.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231124">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231124/#Comment_231124" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T09:33:39+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  9:33AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 9:38AM by Andy.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Valamir</cite>Andy does your game also suggest / allow for / feature the "Failure as Success but with Consequences" technique?</blockquote>\nYeah, 1-2 pieces of GM advice later I talk about failure, and how you shouldn't create tasks where Failure Stops the Game. In that section, I talk about describing these classic tasks (stuff like "find the clue") as not whether you succeed or not ("do you find the clue?"), but rather create another condition for failure ("do you find the clue in the ninja hideout before the ninjas return?" "Do you... oh, actually, here's the exact wording from the text (from the section "Failure Shouldn't Break the Game"), but note that I use some of the lingo of the rules system:<br/><i><br/>* You are in the hut of the Ashen Ninja. You need three successes on a Senses: Notice roll to find the Ultimate Arts scroll (the object the PCs need to continue the scenario) before the ninjas return. If you fail, they\u2019ll spot you and attack.<br/><br/>* The swordsmith crosses his arms and refuses to bind your shiki prayer strip into the blade of his masterwork sword (the object the PCs need to continue the scenario). You need two successes on a Spirit: Persuasion roll to convince him to do it. Otherwise, he will refuse, and you\u2019ll have to do a hard task for him first.<br/><br/>* The regent is adamant in his position to continue the war (the condition needed to end the scenario), despite the fact that you dispatched the assassin who was aiming for his life. You\u2019ll need to roll Station: Art of Rule to convince him to negotiate peace and call off the war. It will be a contested roll against the Regent, who has a Station of 15 and an Art of Rule skill ranked at Master (4), so get ready to spend that Kiai. If you succeed, he\u2019ll realize the folly of the war and immediately call for negotiations with his enemy. If you fail, he\u2019ll call for negotiations in an attempt to personally assassinate the regent when they meet (presumably the PCs will be there to try to stop him from doing so).</i><br/><br/>I also state:<br/><br/><i>If there is a clue that needs to be found, simply have the characters in the scene make a Senses: Notice roll, and the PC with the most successes finds it. If there is an NPC who needs to be convinced to do a task essential to the scenario, simply have the PC roll for it, where success or failure comes down to \u201cDoes this NPC willingly help you, or does he grudgingly help you then quickly alert your enemies?\u201d, and not \u201cDoes he help you or not?\u201d</i><br/><br/>So I don't really call it a "Failure as a Success", but rather "Change the Failure Condition to Not Break the Game": Which is another way of saying "Free and Clear/Stating Intent/Setting Stakes" without having to explain all that baggage and keeping it at the layman level. But yeah basically po-tay-to po-tah-to.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231128">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray" title="Brad_J_Murray"><img alt="Brad_J_Murray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/574/nEGD88NKOGR1L.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brad_J_Murray">Brad_J_Murray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231128/#Comment_231128" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T09:41:08+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  9:41AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Concessions.<br/><br/>That's the FATE mechanism where, at any time in a fight, you can offer a resolution to the whole mess instead of getting your ass handed to you.

I know what I was trying to accomplish, I know I failed, and I know that I'm going to wind up Angry (or Tired, or Hungry, or Sick). That gives me a beginning and an end, and now I just have to make up the middle. And the GM can always choose to add a Twist instead, if they think of something particularly clever. I believe the rules encourage GMs to make up a few specific Twists ahead of time, if the players utterly fail a roll connected to a major plot point just to make sure that the patrol's mission doesn't go completely off the rails.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231150">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jan" title="Jan"><img alt="Jan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://api.ning.com/files/aMCvJWa*119KpxWfJKRX3wq*4TaoGdbPDFLD2u-xwv3UxkjerE6mt2*bPXjTPEakxlyfWEOhLHh83PvGpr4dR0WqgIT-CrY4/madmansig.png?width=48&amp;height=48&amp;crop=1%3A1"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jan">Jan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231150/#Comment_231150" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T10:41:15+00:00" title="September 10, 2009 10:41AM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Andy, your examples are great!

(an actual example).  Another example would be looking to find the 5th column operating within an enemy controlled area, Great success, find 'em.  Failure, find 'em but have botched search enough you bring a raid down on them and you at that time (actual ranges between varying with different atttitudes, amount of help they will give etc.)<br/><br/>(c) not success, where you wanted to be in story but not quite the situation you wanted or as I describe it "on a failure you may still get the same thing as on a success, it just comes at you pointy end first" - do you succeed in finding the cult by observing them as they gather, or by being lured to their gathering spot to be set upon by them.....<br/><br/>I think apart from "fun failure", the idea of "fail forward" is important.

Honestly, as a GM I love to do this stuff, so what usually happens is I, as GM, narrate the players failures in those ways above: And note that *I still do leave in "whiffs"* - which I think are basic and important as well - just not all the time. Maybe 30% of the time or so. It's actually only when I myself am stymied to try to think of an interesting way that they failed that I turn to the player. Or if I just had that feeling that the player didn't have a lot of actions/stuff to do/stuff to describe in that scene I'd have them describe the failure. I totally don't do it all the time, and as a player would probably flounder around a lot if I had to describe EVERY failure. I'd say that outside of combat, I have players describe their own failures maybe 10% of the time. Inside combat in a combat-heavy game (L5R, etc) more like 20-30%.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_231309">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis" title="Jarvis"><img alt="Jarvis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.geocities.com/neastrith1/Smiley_Avatar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jarvis">Jarvis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231309/#Comment_231309" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T13:50:38+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  1:50PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 10, 2009 1:56PM by Jarvis.">edited September 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is hilarious! The failure topic must be floating around in the ether lately cause it seems to be popping up everywhere. I actually dedicated a section to it in <a href="http://dogdaygames.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Dead Running</a>, the game chef entry I just finished:\n<blockquote>In <i>Dead Running</i>, <b>nothing never happens</b>. Something is always more interesting, fun, and entertaining than nothing. For this reason, something must always happen.<br/><br/>This means, tests may never be Pass/Fail. Any test that remains Pass/Fail, due to lack of creativity from the group, automatically succeeds. Traits are only tested when it will produce one of two outcomes, both of which are interesting, fun, or entertaining. Preferably all three!<br/><br/>Pass/Fail: A fence can be climbed (pass) or not climbed (fail).<br/><br/>In <i>Dead Running</i>, a character attempting the above test would automatically succeed. Failure would mean nothing happened, since the character is still on the same side of the fence, and in this game <b>nothing never happens</b>.<br/><br/>Pass/Pass: An alarm can be disarmed (pass) or triggered (pass).<br/><br/>This conflict is more interesting because either option produces a change in the story. <i>Dead Running</i> is not about shooting or missing, it's about shooting or getting shot. With a little thought, you can turn any Pass/Fail test into a Pass/Pass test. In the above example, not climbing the fence could mean getting caught by security, being separated from the others, or being forced to go the long way.</blockquote>\nIt was totally Mountain Witch that buried this little nugget of wisdom in my brain. No one ever fails in Mountain Witch, success just belongs to the other guy. The game becomes a question of who succeeds and by how much instead of "did anyone succeed". It's much preferable to the alternative I think!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins" title="Ben_Robbins"><img alt="Ben_Robbins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.lamemage.com/media/icon-jugclose32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Robbins">Ben_Robbins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231393/#Comment_231393" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T15:56:08+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  3:56PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's my take from a while back: <a href="http://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/65/learn-to-explain-failure/" rel="nofollow">Learn to Explain Failure</a><br/><br/>The counter-intuitive part from the GM's point of view is to emphasize, not shy away from failure.

One reason is that failure is heavily textured. So when Meg Tatas, daughter of Gloria Tatas and James Bond, who is Bothered by Boys, In Her Mother's Shadow, and Forgetful tries to beat up the Mastermind's Soho Gangsters she could succeed and tell how she defeats the British criminals - choosing to escalate them, or leave them defeated (at least for now). Success doesn't get much more complicated than that.<br/><br/>But if she fails, that's when things get interesting. Any of the following could happen, each an interpretation of a different failure outcome - literally a different roll of the dice:<br/><br/>1) Meg is overrun and tackled by the gangsters, and decides not to worry so much about what these attractive young men might think of her. (learning about her Bothered by Boys)<br/><br/>2) Meg is surrounded by gangsters, and decides that if she's going to get out of this she'll need to try something her mother would never do. (learning about In Her Mother's Shadow)<br/><br/>3) Meg is chased into an abandoned building. It's a life or death race, and she can't afford to forget the way out. (learning about Forgetfulness)<br/><br/>4) Meg is fending off the gangsters just fine, until one of them complements her, and then she just falls apart.<br/><br/>5) Meg challenged the leader of the gangsters to a duel, and has him at her mercy, but hesitates too long, thinking back to what her mother would do. <br/><br/>6) In the midst of the melee, Meg reaches for a tazer to deal with a particularly burly gangster, but alas she forgot to recharge it, she curses as her vision fades. <br/><br/>This is important, since in Coming of Age, you often fail at first, so that failure needs to be fun and interesting. By the time you've exhausted what you can from these options, your character has built to the point where you are going to start winning much more often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_231396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/231396/#Comment_231396" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-10T16:05:21+00:00" title="September 10, 2009  4:05PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's interesting Mendel, sounds in my mind like a weird cross of Poke'Mon (Ok, any coming of age story, but it really hit me when Ash lost to Brock in episode 5 and had to train and then beat him.

Similarities are easy to see, although both games are quite different, having been designed independently.<br/><br/>Coming of Age has been one of several designs where I've taken a hard look at what makes task resolution fun, and a big part of that is making sure that failure is appropriately interesting. Another part is making the impact of an action's effect on the larger themes and ideas of the story more transparent. When this doesn't happen you get otherwise good task resolution systems burdened by an implicit GM fiat conflict resolution system.  <br/><br/>In Coming of Age, the impact of defeat is often to learn about yourself, which propels a character towards overcoming her flaws and maturing during the course of the game. The details of this growth varies, but it will happen to each character. So the suspense for the players is not the typical "will she overcome her flaws?" but "how will she overcome them?". After all, it may be a perfectly good story if the plucky, but unskilled heroine is killed off in the fourth chapter, but it isn't her coming of age story.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
