I don't think I heard a word against it. <br/><br/>Now, there are two reviews of it published today: <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13270.phtml" rel="nofollow">Chris Richeson's review</a> and <a href="http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/13/13279.phtml" rel="nofollow">Matthijs Holter's review</a>. They're both rather downbeat.<br/><br/>(Posting links to negative reviews was what caused the trepidation).<br/><br/>Could some of the people that saw/played/played a demo of Steal Away Jordan explain the discrepancy? I can think of several reasons.<br/><br/>I must point out that I'm not looking for New Honesty here. I'm genuinely flummoxed, because Steal Away Jordan got hugely positive buzz. <br/><br/>So I want someone to say "We played it and it was great" or "It's a great game but the text needs work" or "The demo was great but perhaps it shows problems in a full length game".<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm interested and genuinely rather confused.<br/><br/>Graham                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95898">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor" title="Brennan_Taylor"><img alt="Brennan_Taylor" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brennan_Taylor">Brennan_Taylor</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95898/#Comment_95898" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T09:14:05+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  9:14AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played the demo and it was powerful and moving. The play itself hit on the themes I wanted from a slave narrative, and I definitely saw myself playing a full-length game and getting something out of it.<br/><br/>That said, I only skimmed the book. I haven't read it in-depth, and I haven't formed an opinion of the rules as presented in the book. There may be some problems there, and both of these reviewers seem to think there are. Both did point out that they saw a really good game in there, just not fully expressed by the written rules.<br/><br/>Also, I wish you hadn't felt trepidation about posting this.

He doesn't realize that the game is about people, not victims; the characters in SAJ (available over <a href="http://stone-baby.com/?page_id=4" rel="nofollow">here</a>) are the people who have a shot at defining their lives in a way that few humans do, ever.</p>\n<p>The game is a lot of fun. It's about doing what you can to become a free person. The mechanics make things tough for you, but they make things tough for everyone, including your owner and other oppressors. But you, unlike they, have a chance to do something heroic, to become free, to become a piece of history. Your owner just owns a plantation. You can live and die by heroic effort, helping your friends, defeating your enemies, and making it out despite all their efforts. Their interest in you is as cattle (or sometimes as a target of affection, but the power dynamic has more to say on that than you might like); your interest is in your humanity. Trying those against each other in fiction favors the humanity, and the whole game supports that.</p>\n<p>I had a good time when we played and I'd love to play more (I'd like to set it smack in the middle of the Civil War). I think my character, "Marshal" is in the book, so if you've got it, you can see what his bag was, at least in part. He was a Muslim blacksmith from Angola, a respected man in town, who'd been  bashed on the head for getting on someone's bad side and illegally sold into slavery. His goal was to get a new family and become a tradesman again, and to eventually own a slave of his own (he'd had one back home). The target of his family aspirations was Ginny, who was pregnant with someone's baby, probably Emily's character's. Vincent was trying to get free with his brother (he did) and Meg's character was trying to run, as well, as he'd murdered a nasty, nasty man.</p>\n<p>Everyone got free in their own way but Emily's character, who wound up being taken down by the dogs chasing Vincent's character. Vincent's dude and his brother made it to Ohio, where they parted ways, unable to really address their past, including some of the things they'd had to do to get free. Meg's character escaped the death sentence, thanks to my framing someone else for the murder he did (the murder, by the way, was completely justified and the closest you could have gotten to justice for a slave), and Marshal got to give himself back his own name \xe2\u20ac\u201d Yusuf \xe2\u20ac\u201d and became a free tradesman with Ginny as his wife, having bought his freedom through ... well, basically fucking with the owner mercilessly. People called him "Joe".</p>\n<p>The mechanics are, in large part, about helplessness, but they're about doing whatever you can when you're helpless, not <em>being</em> helpless. You engage the mechanics as often as possible because you need a shot at good stuff, not because the dice are in your favor (which, oddly, doesn't seem to be something you can affect). So you do what you can to get free.</p>\n<p>The game is about freedom. There's not better way to address freedom than by making the protagonists slaves.</p>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_95909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95909/#Comment_95909" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T09:47:57+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  9:47AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I played a demo and bought the game but have not read it. The demo was intense. I'm sure part of it was because Julia was intense and a talented GM. But the rules themselves were fun, I liked how characters are created, I liked the skull die, and I liked lucky 7s. The dice didn't take away from my immersion. And I like the gimmicky dice tricks in this game because they help let off tension that might become overbearing otherwise. It's a fun distraction from the seriousness of the fiction. But only distracting enough to let you keep delving in deeper. I would imagine if I read the book and had not played that I might think differently. But in play, you can really see what the different rule aspects have to offer (I noticed this in the recent review of Dread as well). Rule wise, I remember wanting to find out if there were any rules for situation or situation generation. <br/><br/>In terms of the actual text and production values, I can't comment from personal experience. I would guess the reviews are accurate in this regards as these are criticisms that can be reviewed without the benefit of playing the game (which the reviewers may have).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95911">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95911/#Comment_95911" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T09:54:40+00:00" title="September 14, 2007  9:54AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that a lot of people miss the rules in SAJ.

I played in a demo, and I'm planning on setting up for a full-blown run of the game.  I'm actually going out and doing research on slavery in the 1860s and Reconstruction and the like.  (Aside:  <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~hyper/wpa/HUGHES1.HTML" rel="nofollow">this page</a> has audio of an interview with a former slave.  No lie!)  My plan is to play through 1860 to 1867 on a small plantation in Virginia.  The master is a kind man, and the household is generally peaceful.  But there's a war on, and there are still slaves.  So, how does this all play out?  I have high hopes that it could be a powerful game.  In fact, I'm pushing it back on the schedule of RPGs to be played, specifically to allow me to do the additional historical research that I want to be able to incorporate into the game.<br/><br/>I think that the game has a lot going for it mechanically.  I like that the dice mechanic actually means that having more dice could be a penalty, because you can roll more ones.  Personally, my favorite mechanic is that the GM names the character but the player has secret goals.  I'm waiting to see how that works in play, but I have high hopes.<br/><br/>I have some specific mechanical questions about the Root Doctor, but I may or may not include that in my game.  Still haven't decided.  I'd also love guidance on GMing this game, especially interacting with the secret goals that the players have.  But maybe I'll just figure it out along the way.<br/><br/>My big concern is with the text.  The rules summary in the back has everything nicely lined out, which is cool.  However, the book itself isn't organized quite as neatly.  I'd want a better thought flow from concept to concept.  Currently it works okay, but I'd want it to be great!  There are also some overlooked items.  For example, the rules on Minor Bargains don't actually state that each player rolls five dice.  It's in the example and the rules summary in the back, so I figured it out pretty quickly.  But I figure that Julia would want to know about that.<br/><br/>And hey, you know what?  I'm not going to hold any of this against Julia.  I've looked at my first game (<i>Junk</i>)and shuddered, both at presentation and content.  I mean, the core is solid, but there is so much that I'd do over again.  And you know what?  Maybe I will.  I know that Julia has a similar opinion about her game.  She mentioned to me that she isn't opposed to releasing a revised edition.<br/><br/>So, I don't want to sound like I'm griping about the game.  By no means!  Rather, I'm planning on sitting down and giving this a solid run, then writing up my experiences.  Hopefully, they will be helpful to Julia, both in her ongoing support of <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> and in her further design work.<br/><br/>And I'm really looking forward to it, too.<br/><br/>Seth Ben-Ezra<br/>Great Wolf                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare" title="devilmaycare"><img alt="devilmaycare" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare">devilmaycare</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/95931/#Comment_95931" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T10:19:25+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 10:19AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Perhaps it's a "writer not included" issue?

Don't let the reviews get you down.  I remember seeing reviews of my game.  You know, my babies, which I poured my life blood into.  And people said that they sucked.  That's not really fair.  But they weren't the rave reviews that I've always given my own game in my head.  And it stung.  So, I have this sense of how you're probably feeling.

Indeed, they both seem to be asking for a longer book with more in-depth explanations.</blockquote>\nI feel this way about several indie games, this one included.<br/><br/>Here's a review from the perspective of someone who isn't friends with the author and hasn't been taught to play by her.  All I have, like many consumers, is the book at home with no one to teach me how to play.  So I review the game as it's written, perhaps not as the author imagines it or presents it in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95953">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

I read the examples, look at the pictures of abused slaves, and look at the one sided mechanics and conclude that the game is about victims.  Based solely on the text that's what I see again and again.  Now, based on Gen Con actual play it sounds like the game is about overcoming the problems of slavery.  Escaping or getting a better life somehow.  I think that sounds much more interesting, but I also think that's why there's such a disconnect here.  I just don't take that away from the text, but I don't doubt that's what other people experienced in play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_95963">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

There's a was a sidebar box with this text.  I thought of it reading this thread.  I'm posting a quote because there's an issue on this site about criticism that's much bigger than<i> Fly Away, Jordan</i>.<br/><br/><i><b>The Good Critique: It's an art form that everyone needs.</b><br/><br/>Students who enroll in the prestigious School of the Art Institute of Chicago are asking for a lot of rejection; much of their training comes in the form of formal critiques. In session after session, work is pinned on the wall for teachers and classmates to pick apart.<br/><br/>It's an art form in itself. "We tell the freshman, 'We are talking about Mr. Red Square and Mr. Blue Square, not you. Your piece may be no good\xe2\u20ac\u201dbut it doesn't mean that you're no good,'" says Paul Coffey, head of the graduate and undergraduate divisions. Students must trust their inner critic, must be willing to experiment with their ideas, and yet at the same time incorporate others' reactions to their work. Professors prod students to specify why they don't like a particular piece, to explore how it works in formal and political terms, and to share their emotional reaction to it.<br/><br/>The best critique, Coffey says, is steered by the student in the hot seat. "I was having problems executing this idea," she may say. "How could I have conveyed it better?" With defensive barriers down, the student can hear the feedback on a higher level. "When classmates tell a student he needs to get a little more reckless with his painting technique, it resonates and he may realize he needs to take more risks in his personal life, too."</i><br/><br/>No one is attacking Julia, as far as I can see.  So she needs no defending.  All that's at stake is her book.  It sounds like the text could use some work, maybe some layout issues.  I haven't seen it, so I don't know.  <br/><br/>Many people who've played the game had a great time.  Some people who'd seen the book (players and non-players alike), see a disconnect.<br/><br/>If these critiques help move the text closer to something that deliver the fun <i>it's all good</i>.<br/><br/>CK<br/><br/>(Here's the <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/pto-20070723-000013.html" rel="nofollow">article</a> for anyone interested (it's mostly about rejection in general, and not about art critique, so it will only be so helpful.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96002">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lizthefair" title="lizthefair"><img alt="lizthefair" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lizthefair">lizthefair</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96002/#Comment_96002" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T11:22:42+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 11:22AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<sub>If you want to delve deeper into new ways to give and receive critical feedback, I really recommend <a href="http://www.sadu.org/Liz%20Lerman%20Critical%20Response.htm" rel="nofollow">The Critical Response Process</a> by Liz Lerman and John Borstel.

I played the demo at The Forge booth at GenCon (run by the author...thanks Julia).  It was incredibly uncomfortable for me, probably <i>the </i>most uncomfortable moments in my gaming life.  I recorded the demo for Canon Puncture (my podcast) and may play it for a future episode, but I'm still unsure if I want to "go there" with a podcast that has never hit on "games as social commentary" as a subject.<br/><br/>In the demo, I played an older slave who knew how to grow rice.  He was asked to watch after the other PC, a troublesome slave who liked to break things.  My PC caught the other slave breaking farm tools and in a resulting tussle, the other PC died.  After the other PC died, the GM explained that he could play his PC's ghost, which was a really weird concept based on what I thought the game would be.<br/><br/>My PC had to tell the master what had happened and as a result, he was whipped severely and survived, but according to the die roll "something bad happened".  That was when the GM told me, "OK, describe what happens when you're whipped."  Wow... I felt flush and kind of sick for a brief second, then I described that the whipping tore into my PC's flesh and damaged a shoulder muscle, impairing him for life.  That was the end of the demo, and I ended up sitting there feeling really weird.<br/><br/>The idea of Worth as a stat was the most compelling aspect of the demo.  The abundance of dice, re-rolling, counting up, then possibly trumping with another skull die roll was a bit of an effort, but as a chunky white guy from the US south, the respite from "playing" a slave was a welcome break.<br/><br/>I never looked at the book other than the cover.  I appreciate what the book is trying to do, but I have no interest in telling that kind of story with a leisure activity at this point in my life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96037/#Comment_96037" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T12:20:34+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 12:20PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm okay with constructive criticism. I have thanked both Matthijs and Chris for their reviews, and the appreciation was heartfelt. I don't have to agree with everything they say and still be gracious and appreciative that they took the time to review the game. When I sit down and work on Steal Away Jordan again, I'll have copies both reviews, AP reports, and all the other comments that people have put out there, to work with to improve the game. I may not use all the suggestions or comments because they may not be in line with my vision, and as such may not be helpful, but I'd be foolish to ignore them.<br/><br/>When I was in college I took a writing class. I had to submit a writing sample in order to be let in. The professor accepted about 25% of all the students who tried to get in, so it was a big deal to be in the class. Some weeks my professor really liked my stuff. Sometimes he didn't. He was an honest, thorough, and occasionally, harsh critic. For our final project we had to go back and revise a story. I picked the one that got the harshest criticism (it dealt with a difficult, painful subject--see a pattern here?). I got an A and it was noted that I improved and revisited work that had a strong backbone but needed work, and I did the work. I thought it was some of my best writing the first time I handed it in. My professor thought so, too, and wanted to see me cut out the bullshit and make it publishable. So he was harsh and honest. <br/><br/>Matthijs and Chris have no investment in me as a writer as my professor did. They're reviewers, they have opinions, they publish those opinions. It's up to them to be fair, but they don't benefit from being fair. It makes the criticism a little bit harder to take, especially since all eyes are on the writer to see what she and other people say next.. <b>It doesn't make it less valuable.</b> (so don't think that's what I'm saying!) I had a really fruitful conversation with Matthijs via email, which made the review a whole lot more helpful.<br/><br/>Truthfully, a bad review sucks. Before the rational deconstruction of what is said, and the taking to heart and the noting where your blind spots were, there's the initial visceral sensation that someone just told you that you have an ugly, stupid child. And since you love your children despite their flaws, a bad review at first really smarts.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone here is blindly defending the game.<br/><br/>It would be foolish to take in a criticism and not examine it for its fairness and unfairness. It would foolish to ignore it altogether. We'd go nuts if we didn't listen to people say that our children are beautiful and smart when there's a spotlight on them and we first think others are saying they're stupid and ugly.<br/><br/>So yeah, criticism is good. In addition to very constructive feedback, I keep hearing "I would never play this game,and I have no interest in telling that kind of story." That's not helpful to me when I revise, because it's not something I can really change. If anything, it helps me see who my audience is. If you don't want to play a game set in slavery in the US, where you are a black slave, you'll have to play a different game, because even after all the revisions and additions and improvements, the game is still a role playing game where you create a character who is a black slave in the antebellum US. <br/><br/> Again, a review on rpg.net isn't my professor giving me feedback with his investment in me as a student. It's one person, sharing his experience with the text and/or with play. And the difference between a review and feedback is to me that the review is more for other players, not so much for the designer. So should a reviewer mark down a  game because it's not his "thing"?  For a player, that's a valid concern. For me, it's less so, especially since Steal Away Jordan is about something difficult, and maybe controversial. It does concern me if the reviewer considers the subject matter and how it plays to him and his friends as a negative issue.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare" title="devilmaycare"><img alt="devilmaycare" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/devilmaycare">devilmaycare</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96043/#Comment_96043" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-14T12:26:37+00:00" title="September 14, 2007 12:26PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua A.C.

Which I guess most people had figured out already, right?<br/><br/>I was very happy to get the opportunity to review Steal Away Jordan. I know that not everyone sees role-playing as an artistic medium, and also that some people don't like the idea of some cultural products being seen as important; however, I do, and I think SAJ is a very important game.<br/><br/>I am especially impressed by the fact that Julia wrote it because she thought it would be interesting and <i>fun</i>. That's personally relevant to me as a designer; I'm writing a role-playing piece about the Holocaust, which I have enjoyed participating in several times.<br/><br/>As a reviewer - or critic? - I write with both the author and potential buyers in mind. I've often read published books and thought "I wish I saw this before it was printed, so I could have given some advice". I try to give some of that advice through the review, in the form of "this text needs these elements and this structure to work".<br/><br/>One thing I didn't mention in the review (I think), because I'm not sure where the thought belongs or whether it's useful to anyone, is the fact that she's part of a very specific group of designers, who know each other and make interesting and innovative games. However, in my personal opinion, these are also games that sometimes fail to convey to the reader exactly how they're meant to be played. <br/><br/>I'd love to play "Steal Away Jordan" with Julia, for instance, or "Under the Bed" with Joshua. They're both games that clearly have the potential for deep and meaningful play, and those who have played with the authors seem to reach that level of play. However, the rules have blind spots. And now that there are so many different ways to play RPGs, we can't assume a default style of play anymore.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96339">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/olepeder" title="olepeder"><img alt="olepeder" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/olepeder">olepeder</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96339/#Comment_96339" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T12:23:01+00:00" title="September 15, 2007 12:23PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 12:28PM by olepeder.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s around eight in the evening; September\xe2\u20ac\u2122s been beautiful here in Oslo. I heard the summer was rotten, but I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been away to South America the last half year. I came back two and a half weeks ago, with a baaad hankering for role playing. Except for all the time spent on the Norwegian RPG-forum rollespill.net, interviewing the RPGPundit in Uruguay, and flipping through the AD&amp;D books in the Venezuelan American book store in Caracas, I hadn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t \xe2\u20ac\u0153had any\xe2\u20ac\x9d in seven months. So when Matthijs suggested Steal Away Jordan, I was all over it.<br/><br/>I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m sitting in the living room where we tested the game, the rest of the collective are playing Amiga emulators on Michael\xe2\u20ac\u2122s X-Box. My brother is visiting for the weekend; he\xe2\u20ac\u2122s much, much better than when I visited him in the institution before I went away. We\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll head out later on.<br/><br/>H\xc3\xa5ken didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t want to participate in the play test. He asked me why Matthijs always wants to play \xe2\u20ac\u0153gruesome stuff\xe2\u20ac\x9d.<br/><br/>I fully support exploring subjects like this in RPGs. Whether it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s Matthijs\xe2\u20ac\u2122 Holocaust-RPG or Julia\xe2\u20ac\u2122s game about slavery. I knew what I was getting into, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d read the blog-presentation and some of the forum discussions. But I guess I wasn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really in the mood for it. I just wanted to roleplay again. It was my first day at work in half a year, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d been in the country for six days. So I just wanted to have some fun.<br/><br/>As a white, 26 year old, blonde Norwegian, it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s my impression \xe2\u20ac\u201c after having travelled extensively in the continent - that the issue of race is somewhat more present in the Americas than back home. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve been exposed to racism, and I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve probably acted on racist impulses. <br/><br/>Not that we don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have our share of racism here, sometimes I think our culture is, on some level, fundamentally racist. But we don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t talk about it, as much. Some of the stereotyped portrayals of foreign cultures/races in U.S. popular culture (Apu on the Simpsons, just about any Mexican immigrant worker on any show) just wouldn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t fly here (on a Norwegian show, that is. Half our programming is from the U.S., and no-one seems to mind). It\xe2\u20ac\u2122d be labelled \xe2\u20ac\u02dcracist\xe2\u20ac\u2122. I asked some of the people I met in South America * what they thought about the representation of \xe2\u20ac\u0153Latinos\xe2\u20ac\x9d on American shows. They weren\xe2\u20ac\u2122t too fond of it. <br/><br/>The history of slavery and colonization is more present in the Americas than in my homeland. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s present in the faces you see on the streets, the people you meet. Or the faces you don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t see in the U.S., as opposed to e.g. Colombia, symbolizing extermination.<br/><br/>Aaanyhow. I was tired, it was a Monday, and I\xe2\u20ac\u2122d done a days work for the first time in seven months. I didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t have much fun with the game. It disgusted me, a bit. The bunches, and bunches and bunches of die rolls. Goals and benchmarks. I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m used to more of a freestyle approach, I guess. And maybe I tend to fall into Snakes and Ladders-mode when confronted with rules that give you a chance of winning or loosing. \xe2\u20ac\u0153Gamism\xe2\u20ac\x9d, or whatever we call it these days. So I got into \xe2\u20ac\u0153gamism\xe2\u20ac\x9d-mode. My character was cursing NPCs. My friend\xe2\u20ac\u2122s character was forced by the master to have intercourse with one of his fellow slaves (NPC). And a good time was had by all. Or not.<br/><br/>Slavery exists to this day. On Thursday, I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ll meet the police officer who coordinates work against trafficking here in Norway (I\xe2\u20ac\u2122m a journalist). <br/><br/>Steal Away Jordan (I have not read the book, only played the game) has some powerful and important mechanics with regards to it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s subject matter. That you can\xe2\u20ac\u2122t list your master as an enemy. That you have goals and motives even though you\xe2\u20ac\u2122re a subject. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s got more rules and dice rolls than I personally would instil if I were to explore this subject matter in an RPG. And it was a Monday, I was tired, we didn\xe2\u20ac\u2122t get to complete it, completely. And I just wanted to have some fun. It\xe2\u20ac\u2122s both important and good. But not for me, that day.<br/><br/>Now it\xe2\u20ac\u2122s time for me to take my brother out for a drink. There\xe2\u20ac\u2122s no snow on the ground, yet.<br/><br/>(I just discussed whether or not there is any point posting all of this. With Matthijs on MSN and H\xc3\xa5ken just next to me in the couch. I post it, if not for anything else then because it might be interesting for the creator to get some feedback from a player. H\xc3\xa5ken says I\xe2\u20ac\u2122ve misspelled \xe2\u20ac\u0153lose\xe2\u20ac\x9d, and that my complaints about my Monday get too repetitive. Matthijs says I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t really say much about the system despite the fact that I don\xe2\u20ac\u2122t like dice and that I had a bad Monday. And that he\xe2\u20ac\u2122d personally be overjoyed if some Inuit had written about his game in this manner.)<br/><br/>* I visited Columbia, Venezuela, Surinam, French Guyana, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the Falklands.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96360/#Comment_96360" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T13:51:23+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  1:51PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>I think that a lot of people miss the rules in SAJ.

Through all the positive and negative buzz, I keep hearing and reading, "it's an interesting premise, but I would never want to play this game, because it's too depressing, or slavery isn't fun, or the subject matter isn't what I'm into, or I can't relate, or...." After the 10th time it starts to sound like role players are wusses. Not because you can't play games about brutality, or slavery but because all you see is a bunch of colored folks on the cover the book, and that freaks you out, especially when you realize you are one of those colored folk. I really want to be proven wrong, but it hasn't happened yet. Please, someone prove me wrong! See there are tons of popular rpgs, hippie, indie, mainstream, where the objectives are to fuck people's shit up, put on over on someone, kill, maim, hurt, win, be notorious, save yourself, your loved ones, kill your enemy, live, die, do something heroic. And this game is no different. <br/><br/>You do not play a "subject"! You don't play a "victim"! You play a <b>person</b>, for crying out loud. Slaves were people. If you play a person, you will likely strive for good things to happen to you and everyone you care about. You'll look for good things. You'll seek to love people. And you'll probably figure out real quick how to get out of bad things happening to you. You'll then create an uplifting story, because, coming out of adversity is uplifting, it's what most slave narratives are about, it's what slaves would want to do. Heck it's what many, many role playing games are about. Slave narratives are about people who happen to be slaves, but are people first. Slave narratives are about people maintaining their dignity and humanity in the face adversity. Sounds like a lot of role playing games. <br/><br/>I know I'm pretty clear in the text that you shouldn't play a stereotype, and that you should play a person. If you missed that, go back and read it over. And why wouldn't you play anything but a person, if I state that the game is about creating slave narratives--about people, not stereotypes.<br/><br/>Don't know how to play a black person? Can't relate? Play yourself with dark skin. (Heck, you don't even have to have dark skin. Black people come in a multitude of shades, and there were more than a few blond haired blue eyed house slaves on the plantations.) Play a friend. Create a character who isn't black and then just pretend. Recycle your favorite Dogs character or your samurai from the Mountain Witch. It doesn't matter the time or setting or what your actual ethnicity, nationality, or cultural identification is, when we play people, we all know how to hope for things, how to love, how to hate people. Does that need to be spelled out in the text? I didn't think so. My bad. I thought people had the good sense and creativity to get that black people aren't that unique or problematic when it comes to character creation. You don't even have to know any real live black people to understand that!<br/><br/>A negative review doesn't hurt or piss me off nearly as much as someone saying that just he can't play these types of characters. Because ya'll do it all the time. Perhaps you don't play black people, but there are games out there where you play a slave (<a href="http://www.halfmeme.com/master.html" rel="nofollow">My Life With Master</a>), and you are brutalized (take your pick!). You play characters who suffer, and rise above it, and therein lies your character's heroics. I think ya'll are harping on the slave thing a bit too much. Play a person, not a slave, not a victim, not Uncle Remus or Uncle Tom, not a coon, not a mammy, not a mystical magical negro (no, you can't even play that if you're the Root Doctor). <br/><br/>From where I'm sitting, being a black woman standing in a room full of fellow gamers who are overwhelmingly white and male, it seems that many of you are too scared or--whatever-- to even entertain the thought that a black slave might have more in common with you than you think. You can play downtrodden elves, samurais beaten to the curve, but God help you, you're too afraid to play a black person. You might offend. No one expects you to get it right. This game isn't an historical reenactment. It's pretend, people. Play what you know. Look at it in the context of any other dark, subversive, and fun game and then decide if this is the type of game for you.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96378">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96378/#Comment_96378" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T15:53:13+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  3:53PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Too scared?

I only grazed your review: I'd already bought the game, read it, and want to play it ASAP, so I didn't figure I needed to read the review.<br/><br/>There's a lot of crazy assumptions about the game, which are inaccurate. One is that anyone in the game (slaves, slave-owners, free blacks, poor whites) is dehumanized. Boy, how we love to dehumanize victims of violence (and, if you want my opinion, all of the above were victims of a culture of violence.) Everyone is available for play. The game isn't "GM plays slave master and beats down on players." It's "GM GMs. Players play characters. Characters may beat down on each other or help each other."<br/><br/>It looks like a blast to me, which is why I'll be playing it soon. Probably with a room full of white folks, looking at the gamers in the social circles around me.

I'm sure the game is dramatic and powerful. From what I've read, the game also does a number of things to cause discomfort in the players from having the GM name you to making your die pool equal to your market worth. Its not surprising that some players find it <span style="text-decoration: underline;">too</span> discomforting. Just because someone would rather play Conan killing giant serpents with a broadsword than a slave in ante-bellum south does not make them subconsciously racist or freaked out by having to play a black person.

In that interview he said he created the game for two types of people. The ones who are excited by the chance of addressing the prospect that we are all going to die, and those who can't address it. Death's Door is not a super popular game. I think there are more of the latter and less of the former. Even so, on encountering the premise of the game they are faced with the fact they are going to die. Whether they play or not, they have been challenged, and perhaps that will may help them to face death in the future. On that level I would say the game is an incredible success, I just wish it put more money in James pocket.<br/>\n<br/>\nDespite the fact that you see what is going on in Steal Away Jordan as just playing characters, it isn't. Your game is just like Death's Door. It is asking people to not only address the peculiar institution, but the racism in our culture. This is a taboo, especially for White folks. There is the feeling you can't win in this type of discussion and you are going to just come away looking like a racist. It creates resentment. I think that's one of the things that makes your game beautiful, is that it is trying to address a problem our society isn't facing. It works because I felt what must be what a lot of White folks feel, that moment of feeling like something I was doing was racist and wrong. That's a new experience for me as I've grown up around Black folks, and feel I have more in common with them than non-poor White folks. I've never felt racist. Ever. The examination that came after may not have ever occurred without your game. I think you have to understand that not everyone is going to be comfortable with that experience. Likely they won't even realize it and their resistance will manifest in other ways. Myself I'm eager to play again.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat I'm trying to get across is I don't think a challenging pose is going to benefit you. It's not the characters people are bothered by, it's the discussion itself.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs far as the book, I finished reading it. I understand the mechanics, but I don't think the book provides the reader with what you are doing at the table. I think the experience is too reliant on you at the moment, and that you should consider putting a bit more in the text. It should include some of the things you've already talked about, like play Black people like people. I also think there needs to be more to show folks what you are doing as a G.M. The G.M. is in the hardest spot as being the person who is playing the slave owner. I think you should provide guidance so the person GMing realizes they aren't there to be pricks and be abusive, but to set up difficult problems. Also ideas about what some of those problems could be would be useful.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also concerned that your dice system may actually be making people of higher worth less effective. You have a 1 in 6 chance to roll a 6 on each d6 to generate a bad die. For two dice you have 1 in 36 chance to roll two ones, and a 1 in 3 chance to roll a single one. You have a 1 in 9 chance to get a lucky seven. This means that you have 12 in 36 chance to have a negating roll, and a 1 in 36 chance to have two negations, which means you have a 13 in 36 chance to have a bad result versus a 1 in 9 (4 in 36) chance to get a good result. Now this is as far as I can get with my bit of self taught probability knowledge, so I can't prove that having more dice is worse than having less, there could be some bit of weirdness I don't know about. It could also be I've made a mistake at even generating the two dice probabilities.<br/>\n<br/>\nAll that being said, I'm quite happy with the purchase. Since I've played with you I don't really need the additional text.<br/>\n<br/>\n-edited for some grammar                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96438/#Comment_96438" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T21:31:24+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  9:31PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My worry when considering playing a game without the cushioning and distance that fantasy allows is that I'll trivialize something important.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96443">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96443/#Comment_96443" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-15T21:54:07+00:00" title="September 15, 2007  9:54PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 15, 2007 9:56PM by Parthenia.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>Just because someone would rather play Conan killing giant serpents with a broadsword than a slave in ante-bellum south does not make them subconsciously racist or freaked out by having to play a black person.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with playing characters who kill giant serpents and other beasts that really don't exist in reality. You're comparing apples to oranges. And never did I say my game was for everyone. If you prefer fantasy, so be it. This game isn't for you. <br><br>Actually I find it refreshing when people are honest and say "I can't play this game because of the racial issues.

Or if people just say, "the game isn't for me", or that it's too depressing, or that they can't relate to the characters or the subject matter. This isn't the most brutal game on the planet. Slavery is not unique in role playing games, neither is playing other ethnicities. Don't you take the chance of going out of your comfort zone when you play dramatic and powerful games? Don't you as a player and your friend the GM establish how far out of your comfort zone you're willing to go? Isn't that just common sense and good gaming practice?<br><br>Let me repeat. I'm not calling anyone a racist. Don't like historical games? Don't like reality based games? Then this game might not be for you.

It's the vague, dismissive "it's not for me" and its hybrids, which upon further inquiry tends to yield a more revealing answer that gets me.<br/><br/>And I didn't call anyone a coward.

You need to leave any guilt you have about what your ancestors did to anyone else's ancestors at the door, because that's not my game. And you don't have to play with me. I don't show up at your door when you start to play. <br/><br/>Again, the person who says, "I have this guilt about the whole ancestor thing, and that's why I don't want to play this game" is being honest. Honesty is good. I can start a conversion with honesty, because I can say, "You need to leave the guilt at the door. It's not in my game." If it's in you and it's preventing you from trying this game, you owe it to yourself to be honest and let it go. <br/><br/>Do people who play The Mountain Witch or any other game where you play a Japanese person let the guilt of Japanese internment camps get in the way of creating a Japanese character?  American soldiers did some shitty things people in Viet Nam. Does that prevent Americans from playing Carry? These are both awesome games, not for everyone, but if you're willing to go there, you won't regret it. <br/><br/>Playing other ethnicities, even ones our parents or grandparents have shit on, is not unique.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Steal Away Jordan's reviews - Page 2 - Story

be - a fun game. And when we played it, the person with the least control (it felt like) was me, as a GM. I had no idea what the players had plotted about, and I knew that it was actually fairly easy to win major conflicts against major NPCs, such as owners. At the start of the game, I explicitly told the players I didn't want to play through a rebellion, as I thought that would work best in a game building up over several sessions; if I hadn't told them that, I'm pretty sure they'd have rebelled in wild abandon.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96460/#Comment_96460" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T00:38:29+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 12:38AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Parthenia - I think some people would regret it, or at least would not enjoy the time invested in it. Other than that conclusion, I agree with everything you have said.  The main question is whether a response to your game recognizes its subject matter as legitimate subject matter or rejects it as such.  I strongly recognize it as legitimate. I'll go further: it's <i>overdue.</i><br/><br/>I think you are reading a bit too much into a vague, handwavy "it's not for me" response, though. Remember, most happy gamers have never really thought much about their gaming - they don't need to, they're happy, there's no easily perceivable payoff to being introspective and pondering whether this, that, or the other thing is what they're after in gaming. So it does not surprise me that plenty of people will just put your game, or any game, down and walk away without thinking about why they're rejecting it very much.  They are not expressing anything about the legitimacy of your work - their consumer choices do not run that deep, since they have never needed to.<br/><br/>In that respect, CW's review is not only useful and fair, but one hundred percent accurate. He is approaching your work as a consumer. To him you are dead and buried.

But in truth, the same could be said of any hobby. There's a big chunk of the hobby that are fans who are not committed beyond the enjoyment they get from the hobby, and see no reason why they should be, and then there are those for whom it is a calling, who dig very deep into getting the most out of it that they can.  <br/><br/>This website caters much more to the latter than the former. This should not come as a shock to anyone. If you want a real wake-up in these matters, try going to the RPGSite where they crap all over the idea that roleplaying games can or should in any way be educational, and that sentiment is treated like it's the law of gravity. It quite sincerely boggles their minds that anyone would want to play a villainous character, or a regular person with regular ideals and human flaws, or deal with Big Issues in gameplay. To most of them, anything that deals with Big Issues is an added spice to what is an entertainment at best, and it borders on "wallowing" and "trivialization" at worst. <br/><br/>And I'm not saying either side is wrong, or right. Both sides are comfortable with what they know, and boggle at people who want to try it a different way. Sometimes, never the twain shall meet.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96489">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96489/#Comment_96489" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T07:16:14+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  7:16AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>Maybe they just want to play happy games.

It's the vague, dismissive "it's not for me" and its hybrids, which upon further inquiry tends to yield a more revealing answer that gets me.<br/><br/>And I didn't call anyone a coward. I believe I used the term "wuss" and not in the context in which you put it.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: noclue</cite>As far as I know, there is no other game on the market where a male gamer might find themselves playing a woman slave from a people that their ancestors enslaved while an actual woman from that same people watches. That's new. That's different.</blockquote>\nNo, and that's not my game either. You can play whatever gender you want. You need to leave any guilt you have about what your ancestors did to anyone else's ancestors at the door, because that's not my game. And you don't have to play with me. I don't show up at your door when you start to play.<br/><br/>Again, the person who says, "I have this guilt about the whole ancestor thing, and that's why I don't want to play this game" is being honest. Honesty is good. I can start a conversion with honesty, because I can say, "You need to leave the guilt at the door. It's not in my game." If it's in you and it's preventing you from trying this game, you owe it to yourself to be honest and let it go.<br/><br/>Do people who play The Mountain Witch or any other game where you play a Japanese person let the guilt of Japanese internment camps get in the way of creating a Japanese character?  American soldiers did some shitty things people in Viet Nam. Does that prevent Americans from playing Carry? These are both awesome games, not for everyone, but if you're willing to go there, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>Playing other ethnicities, even ones our parents or grandparents have shit on, is not unique.<br/><br/>Okay, that's a touch disingenuous right there. The Mountain Witch isn't directly dealing with Japanese internment camps either. If it was, it'd be getting some of the same reaction. <br/><br/><b>You</b> can write a game about slavery and racism, and not have it come across as pretentious. <b>I</b> cannot. <b>You</b> can play this game without the nagging sense that you're about to offend someone, and that you're making a boor and ass out of yourself. <b>I</b> probably could not, although I'd like to try. <br/><br/>It's the same reason that cartoons can get away with things that are (and, in a live-action setting with real people, would feel) downright reprehensible. There's a distance, some would say a necessary distance, a coating around the bitter medicine that makes it easier to swallow. Those horrible things our D&amp;D players did without batting an eye to those of Orcish ancestry, without any remorse whatsoever? They don't exist in the real world, and I'll never have to meet any of them and get called on the carpet for my bloody-handed past. <br/><br/>But I have run into African-American men whom I would safely classify as "militant." I had a difficult time dealing with a militant man of Mexican background on a gaming board I frequent, who was notorious for making <b>everything</b> an issue of race and class and privilege.

The Mountain Witch isn't directly dealing with Japanese internment camps either. If it was, it'd be getting some of the same reaction.<br/></blockquote>\nBad example, yes, but disingenuous? No. I gave other examples that illustrate what I'm saying just fine.<br/><br/>I've run into militant people of all creeds and backgrounds. They're difficult to start dialogs with and get down to real issues. I'm not a militant black woman. Really. I'm just not interested in being treated like there's something special or wrong with me because I'm black. My blackness isn't a novelty gimmick either, and so when I feel like I'm being treated unfairly, handled with kid gloves, or not getting the honesty I'm asking for I get a little testy. <br/><br/>That said I don't make everything about race and privilege. I come from a nice comfortable upper middle class background with all the privileges that come with that, black or white. As such, I've had occasion to mix and mingle with lots of white people. (I'm even happily married to one. He's not a gamer though.). All these things about people dealing with their baggage and such is not a new concept to me. Let's pretend my husband stood in for me at GenCon and did the demos, and the cover of the book said "by J.B. Ellingboe", so the only assumption you could make about the author was that he or she might be of Norwegian descent. All these people you talk about who blew me off would have had a different reaction to my game. And that's lame. It's unfair. If <i>I</i> do it, people have baggage. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: spookyfanboy</cite><b>You</b>can write a game about slavery and racism, and not have it come across as pretentious.<b>I</b>cannot.<b>You</b>can play this game without the nagging sense that you're about to offend someone, and that you're making a boor and ass out of yourself.<b>I</b>probably could not, although I'd like to try.<br/></blockquote>\nThat's bullshit. I don't have a special "allowed to write about black history" card by virtue of my being black. The black people I wrote about, and the white people I wrote about <i>are dead</i>. I have more in common with you, being a modern day, literate woman who might have gone to the same private college that your sister went to than with those people from history. (Ever read Kindred?) Put me back in the 1800's and I'd have just as difficult time fitting in as you.<br/><br/>So there's this common ground that I'm inviting people to stand on. I'm trying to show you that in this instance, "black history" doesn't exist. This is American history, and you have as much right to claim it, warts and all, as I do. If you don't want to stand on it that's okay. Really. I'm just asking for some honesty. I'm asking that you treat me as just another game designer and not one who designed a game to hurt your feelings or make you feel guilty for being white. If this type of play isn't your thing, I'm really okay with it. But don't be afraid to have that discussion, and don't hide behind walls that I can't even peek into and dismiss me or blow me off because you think the black woman might do something scary. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: spookyfanboy</cite>It's the same reason that cartoons can get away with things that are (and, in a live-action setting with real people, would feel) downright reprehensible. There's a distance, some would say a necessary distance, a coating around the bitter medicine that makes it easier to swallow. Those horrible things our D&amp;D players did without batting an eye to those of Orcish ancestry, without any remorse whatsoever? They don't exist in the real world, and I'll never have to meet any of them and get called on the carpet for my bloody-handed past.</blockquote>\nCould we please compare apples to apples?  I'm not knocking fantasy if that's what you're into. I like fantasy, too. \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: spookyfanboy</cite>And I'll bet I'm articulating exactly what a lot of those roleplayers were feeling when they muttered some vague comments that were designed to politely blow you, the game designer, off in such a way that the issue of race couldn't be brought up, because they don't feel the need to explore those issues but would be<span style="text-decoration: underline;">damned</span>before they'd say that to a black woman because of the whole "white guilt" deal.<b>You</b>may state unequivocally that this game isn't about a clever way to beat white people over the head about issues of slavery, but there's no guarantee that it won't be used for exactly that, and that is exactly what a lot of (white, mostly male, mostly middle-class) gamers are not in the mood to deal with when it comes to a hobby they primarily get into for the escapism.</blockquote>\nSo I'm damned by to blown off because I'm a black woman, and it's my fault that so many of you couldn't talk to me about this. What do you really think I'd do? You think I have a posse of Black Panther members waiting to kick your ass if I don't like what you say? Talk about fantasy! <br/>Were you afraid you'd hurt my feelings? I've been black all my life, and I've lived among the white folks all my life, too. I've had nastier things said to me in reference to my race than "Wow. I'm not prepared to play this game because the issues of race squick me". That's not a bad thing to say. That's a real, honest thing to say. When I do get the chance to have that conversation, some really awesome things happen, and one of them isn't always that people buy or play my game. I can then recommend a really fun fantasy game that might be more to your liking. Suddenly I'm treated like a peer, like a person, and not a black person archetype.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96500/#Comment_96500" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T08:31:04+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  8:31AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I have to say something, as someone who just reads this thread, and hadn't read the game or the reviews.<br/><br/>Julia, you're awfully militant, and when you attack people, expect them to be defensive.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96504">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96504/#Comment_96504" name="Item_60" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T08:35:30+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  8:35AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite><cite>Posted By: spookyfanboy</cite><b>You</b>may state unequivocally that this game isn't about a clever way to beat white people over the head about issues of slavery, but there's no guarantee that it won't be used for exactly that, and that is exactly what a lot of (white, mostly male, mostly middle-class) gamers are not in the mood to deal with when it comes to a hobby they primarily get into for the escapism.</blockquote>\nWhich brings us neatly around to the "privilege" comment I made in my previous post.

They're difficult to start dialogs with and get down to real issues. I'm not a militant black woman. Really. I'm just not interested in being treated like there's something special or wrong with me because I'm black. My blackness isn't a novelty gimmick either, and so when I feel like I'm being treated unfairly, handled with kid gloves, or not getting the honesty I'm asking for I get a little testy. (1)<br/><br/>That said I don't make everything about race and privilege. I come from a nice comfortable upper middle class background with all the privileges that come with that, black or white. As such, I've had occasion to mix and mingle with lots of white people. (I'm even happily married to one. He's not a gamer though.). All these things about people dealing with their baggage and such is not a new concept to me. Let's pretend my husband stood in for me at GenCon and did the demos, and the cover of the book said "by J.B. Ellingboe", so the only assumption you could make about the author was that he or she might be of Norwegian descent. All these people you talk about who blew me off would have had a different reaction to my game. And that's lame. It's unfair. If<i>I</i>do it, people have baggage. (2)<br/><br/>That's bullshit. I don't have a special "allowed to write about black history" card by virtue of my being black. The black people I wrote about, and the white people I wrote about<i>are dead</i>. I have more in common with you, being a modern day, literate woman who might have gone to the same private college that your sister went to than with those people from history. (Ever read Kindred?) Put me back in the 1800's and I'd have just as difficult time fitting in as you.<br/><br/>So there's this common ground that I'm inviting people to stand on. I'm trying to show you that in this instance, "black history" doesn't exist. This is American history, and you have as much right to claim it, warts and all, as I do. If you don't want to stand on it that's okay. Really. I'm just asking for some honesty. I'm asking that you treat me as just another game designer and not one who designed a game to hurt your feelings or make you feel guilty for being white. If this type of play isn't your thing, I'm really okay with it. But don't be afraid to have that discussion, and don't hide behind walls that I can't even peek into and dismiss me or blow me off because you think the black woman might do something scary. (3) <br/><br/>Could we please compare apples to apples?  I'm not knocking fantasy if that's what you're into. I like fantasy, too. (4)<br/><br/>So I'm damned by to blown off because I'm a black woman, and it's my fault that so many of you couldn't talk to me about this. What do you really think I'd do? You think I have a posse of Black Panther members waiting to kick your ass if I don't like what you say? Talk about fantasy!<br/>Were you afraid you'd hurt my feelings? I've been black all my life, and I've lived among the white folks all my life, too. I've had nastier things said to me in reference to my race than "Wow. I'm not prepared to play this game because the issues of race squick me". That's not a bad thing to say. That's a real, honest thing to say. When I do get the chance to have that conversation, some really awesome things happen, and one of them isn't always that people buy or play my game. I can then recommend a really fun fantasy game that might be more to your liking. Suddenly I'm treated like a peer, like a person, and not a black person archetype. (5)</blockquote>\n(1) I've noticed. But race is a charged issue, and not all people who are militant take care to advertise this. There is no label on the side like there is for foods. That said, I believe you when you say this. <br/><br/>2) "Different" reaction, I can see. "Better" reaction? A (assumedly white) woman writing a game about slavery, no matter how well researched? No, I don't think so. I think the initial reaction would have been, "Oh, god, a roleplaying game about a Big Issue written by someone as an academic exercise. How pretentious. Let's move on." In fact, I think you (for better or worse) got the better reaction simply by being black. It is assumed by default (for better or worse) that because you are a black woman, you are going to take better care in researching this issue and that the game is going to  be "more realistic" in depicting the conditions of the time than it would be if written by a white author who (by default) is assumed to not have as much invested in discussing slavery, whether through literature or an immersive activity like roleplaying. <br/><br/>3) I believe you wholeheartedly when you say you're not playing that card. But there's no guarantee others won't. You and I could both name some names about people we've met who would use your game as an excuse to go beyond talking frankly and honestly about slavery into pillorying white people. <br/><br/> And I hope to hell you don't think I'm shying away from this conversation. I like what you're doing, I agree it's past due, but let's not kid ourselves that there are people who try to turn this game into something it isn't meant to be. <br/><br/>4) My point there was that, in fantasy games, our characters can get away with committing genocide on a grand scale because the fantasy tells us that these creatures are evil and cannot be redeemed, and it is a kindness to slaughter them rather than letting them live to do more evil in the world. Some people value that escapism, where the only dilemma is doing or not doing, and that's not even much of a dilemma. But if all of a sudden you make those enemies human...unless you really enter that kind of game with an escapist mindset, or have underlying issues, that game is going to make you uncomfortable, more uncomfortable than you might be prepared for. <br/><br/>5) Julia, don't shoot the messenger. <b>You</b> are not being blamed for the pussyfooting. <b>I</b> am not living in fear of you sending Black Panthers after me if I say something boorish. But the fact is, when it comes to issues of race and slavery, this uncomfortable silence is going to be an ongoing issue. It's one of those unsatisfying, frustrating-as-hell "that's-just-the-way-it-is" issues that I have every faith your game is trying on some level to address. There's a lot of unspoken fears surrounding talking about slavery and race in today's society. And there will be some people, in the name of politeness and diplomacy, who will not give a sincere answer to your questions because they don't want to step into a trap. Quite possibly, they've been burned that way before.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96541/#Comment_96541" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T09:37:29+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  9:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite><cite>Posted By: spookyfanboy</cite>I'd prefer to be entertained, which this game won't do for me.</blockquote>\nYou're off the hook.

Could you talk more about the magic, what's it like, how it fits into the structure and experience of the game?</blockquote>\nSo you can have no tangible magic and play straight historical narrative, or you can make a ghost story (there are NPC ghost characters), or do something in between. Beloved is a ghost story. Kindred is more speculative fiction than slave narrative. These two books were inspirations.<br/><br/>We had a playtest where one of the PC's wrote as one of her attributes "I can fly." It was a one shot session at a game store, and we had players who were seasoned gamers, rusty gamers, and one woman who the store owner nabbed from a Star Wars game and said, "play this instead". I made it a ghost story. The PC who could fly was the Root Doctor, and her magical use of the herbs was serious magic. The story turned out to be more folk story than straight slave narrative. We still explored more adult themes, and I think the magical and supernatural elements diffused some of the tougher stuff. We also had a funny love story, and a bit of a power struggle between a slave midwife who knew herbs but not magic, and a mute, somewhat crazy Root Doctor who could fly and communicate with animals, and whose spells and potions worked. No one died. One PC escaped with the help of a young slave who was in love with him and the Root Doctor (who, I think didn't like the young slave). The Root Doctor worked for an undertaker. She procured a coffin, and the slave escaped in the coffin.<br/>One of the toughest issues we dealt with was with the midwife and her master, a very kind doctor who was actually in love with her, and kept promising to emancipate her, take her to a free state, and marry her. He never made good on his promise, and now he was on his deathbed (yellow fever). The ghost of his dead wife actually helped the slave realize that the only way she would ever be free was to get the doctor to sign the emancipation papers he'd drawn up, but never formalized. He signed the papers in a stupor (and also willed his estate to her), she waited at his bed dutifully until he died, and she left for a free state with his money. So there was the betrayal from her lover, but with the ghost, we kept it on the lighter side, which isn't to say we didn't have some good dramatic tension between slave and master. Perhaps his cruelty was that he held her freedom unnecessarily.<br/><br/>The story was lots of fun and gleefully historically inaccurate. Women, especially free women of color were not allowed to own property. The yellow fever epidemic we created didn't actually come about until after the Civil War. Because the setting was a city, the slaves had more freedom of movement than plantation slaves would have, but these characters had more freedom of movement than most slaves in history. We played according to the mood of the players. No one really wanted a brutal game, and I wanted to test out playing a lighter, more fantastical game with supernatural elements beyond simple spells. I didn't know one of the players, one was my husband, who isn't a gamer, but played D&amp;D as a kid. Another player was a good friend of mine whom I'd never played with before. She was the Root Doctor. She played herself and then some. And one player was someone I play with regularly, who has played one of the more brutal playtests.<br/><br/>So you can put as much or as little magic in the game as is appropriate for the players. This is a trick I gleaned from Dogs in the Vineyard. Magic is  a subjective thing. It can be a belief in magic or a true tangible element.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96544">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96544/#Comment_96544" name="Item_73" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T09:45:44+00:00" title="September 16, 2007  9:45AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Parthenia</cite><cite>Posted By: Thunder_God</cite>I have to say something, as someone who just reads this thread, and hadn't read the game or the reviews.<br/>Julia, you're awfully militant, and when you attack people, expect them to be defensive.</blockquote>\nGuy, I'll take your advice to heart, and the next time I feel like I'm being treated in a way I don't like, or the next time I think I should speak up about that matters to me, I'll remember that I shouldn't come off as being militant, and I'll lie back and take it quietly.<br/><br/>I'm not attacking anyone.

Is that the intent?</blockquote>\nI think the intent is to see if the Book In Paper is the same as the Book in Julia's Head. Reading the reviews, it seems that there's some disconnects. It seems that folks had problems understanding the way the dice work when reading the book, although the folks that went through the demo and were shown (visually/tactile-y) how they work had different opinions.<br/><br/>It seemed that the folks who sat in a demo also had a very different realization of the subject matter than the people who skimmed through the book and looked at the headers and pictures (raises hand). <br/><br/>Hearing about the game AFTER GenCon makes me really want to play it. In fact I will probably needle Jason M until he runs it locally for us.  But hearing about the game from the buzz at the booth, and seeing the pictures in the book (which I don't have, so I can't reference it: I do recall that there were several pictures of "just slaves", but there were also a bunch of brutal pictures: canings, the poster, selling). Personally, looking at the book (pictures, etc) I got the impression that the game was roleplaying the first 1/3 of Roots. I imagined that if I bought it, again based on the pics and stuff, that I'd be whipping the players through their first auction, cutting off their feet like Kunta Kinte, etc. The book simply evoked that feel.<br/><br/>We've seen a lot of cases where the book in the author's head isn't the book that the consumer buys (even if interested in the subject matter). Usually by the second/revised edition we see a cleaner match. <br/><br/>Hopefully that will be the case here. Bascially, a book that, as written and illustrated, matches closer to the game in Julia's head. That way there will be no confusion, either with the way dice work or the way the theme goes "Yes, you play a slave, but it's not all about seeing how much brutality and misery you can experience (as a character or player)". I guess what I'm hearing is that this game is the equivalent of "Life is Wonderful: The RPG", where Most of the art used came from the Parental Discression Advised section of the Online Holocaust Museum. <br/><br/>Personally, it sounded like a cool game, that I wasn't interested in playing. Now, after hearing more about what the game is "really like", I do want to play it. Perhaps in a later edition we can somehow skillfully take those "what the game is REALLY about" pieces, and apply them to a future writing/editing of the game.<br/><br/>-Andy<br/><br/>EDIT: Also, just wanted to add that this is just my interpretation of seeing this play out. It's very similar in almost every way to conversations I've seen happen on games like the first edition of Dread (Pandemonium) and Mortal Coil.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96549">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy" title="spookyfanboy"><img alt="spookyfanboy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/150/384869271_f51cf8bf05.jpg?v=0"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/spookyfanboy">spookyfanboy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96549/#Comment_96549" name="Item_77" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T10:02:37+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 10:02AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>I think description like that, of using the power of a Root Doctor to fly, could be a very interesting discussion in a future version of SAJ.

But I admit I was. I guess it's a good indicator of where my fears about this game are at: I see it being a game about playing black slaves during the Civil war, and my mind goes immediately to all the horror stories I've heard. The idea that there could be room for fantasy or gentle moments wasn't one that immediately popped into my head, even though I know full well that there was discussion of those elements regarding this game. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm projecting, but I wonder how many people may have wanted to give this game a shot that declined if they knew right up front that those options were available.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96550">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96550/#Comment_96550" name="Item_78" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T10:02:58+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 10:02AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            spookyfanboy, in simple response to your long post, I want people to deal with me.

Nothing they say or think about their game matters ever again once they  publish. Only the text matters, and usually not that much.<br/><br/>My last paragraph follows logically from my first - that a consumer approaches a work from an entirely different perspective than a designer, and the legitimacy of the product's subject matter is often not even considered at all when a consumer is making decisions about the work.

Just saying "There is magic, here are the rules" isn't enough.  I'm reading a game where the examples talk about a slave trying to escape punishment for revealing that a white man is a pedophile and you're running games where the slaves are *flying*.  Talk to me, the reader, about different ways to play instead of leaving it up to me to infer it based on examples, pictures, and the rules.<br/><br/>You could easily have a 5 or 10 page section talking about traditional belief systems, historical magic, or taking the magic to faery tale levels.

I am not blaming you for any militants, but I am saying they exist, and as much as we both want them to go away (ALL OF THEM!), it's just going to be an issue. Honestly, between you and me, between me and your game, I hope there isn't an issue because it sounds awesome. But I just wanted to try to explain what I thought the difficulty was. If you jsut wanted to vent about how hard it was to get people to give your game a fair shot...well, I mistook that for an actual question you wanted feedback on. Maybe I should have asked why you were asking first. As you said, damn Internet communication. <br/><br/>Point 2? Sure. <br/><br/>Point 4--As I just said in another post, I honestly couldn't picture that kind of scenario being possible in this game, given only what everyone else was saying about it at first. Had I known that, or had my own copy of the game, I believe my reaction would have been different. Please understand that I do not have this game, and I'm only going off of secondhand information. <br/><br/>point 5-- I was only bringing up baggage because I was trying to explain in good faith why you weren't getting the answers you wanted and needed for this game. I'm not even talking about my baggage.

Technical writing is a little different. <br/><br/>I'm also the kind of player who believes if it isn't specifically forbidden in the rules, it's fair game. <br/><br/>Elsewhere in the text I give the example of a character who is from the present age, and finds herself a slave in the 1800. This is a direct reference from Kindred. Ghosts and magic are direct references from Beloved. It is stated in my text that the games plays in the spirit of these "neo slave narratives". It's clear to me that I have to make this connection for people in the text. It seemed obvious to me, and to the people who read it before I printed it (two of whom were not gamers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96566/#Comment_96566" name="Item_85" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T10:44:24+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 10:44AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Parthenia - That's a great reference point.

It was a one shot session at a game store, and we had players who were seasoned gamers, rusty gamers, and one woman who the store owner nabbed from a Star Wars game and said, "play this instead". I made it a ghost story. The PC who could fly was the Root Doctor, and her magical use of the herbs was serious magic. The story turned out to be more folk story than straight slave narrative. We still explored more adult themes, and I think the magical and supernatural elements diffused some of the tougher stuff. We also had a funny love story, and a bit of a power struggle between a slave midwife who knew herbs but not magic, and a mute, somewhat crazy Root Doctor who could fly and communicate with animals, and whose spells and potions worked. No one died. One PC escaped with the help of a young slave who was in love with him and the Root Doctor (who, I think didn't like the young slave). The Root Doctor worked for an undertaker. She procured a coffin, and the slave escaped in the coffin.<br/>One of the toughest issues we dealt with was with the midwife and her master, a very kind doctor who was actually in love with her, and kept promising to emancipate her, take her to a free state, and marry her. He never made good on his promise, and now he was on his deathbed (yellow fever). The ghost of his dead wife actually helped the slave realize that the only way she would ever be free was to get the doctor to sign the emancipation papers he'd drawn up, but never formalized. He signed the papers in a stupor (and also willed his estate to her), she waited at his bed dutifully until he died, and she left for a free state with his money. So there was the betrayal from her lover, but with the ghost, we kept it on the lighter side, which isn't to say we didn't have some good dramatic tension between slave and master. Perhaps his cruelty was that he held her freedom unnecessarily.</blockquote>\nAnd in one post you've totally blown open where I thought the game was going or could go.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96570">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96570/#Comment_96570" name="Item_87" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T10:53:44+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 10:53AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            spokkyfanboy, I think you and I are agreeing on more points than we think. I hear what you're saying, I think you hear what I'm saying, and where we disagree, that's great, too. The world needs different opinions. Can we now move on? I was actually asking a serious question, "why can't people be honest with me?", because I wanted to point out to people not being honest with me that I saw the fear and dishonesty. If you approach me as a person and not as a racialized interpretation of what you think I am, we can get along quite well. I don't think I was getting the same amount of honesty other designers get when people don't want to play their games. And I want people to know that <i>I know</i> race is hard, but it shouldn't stop you from letting me pitch my game, and later talking about why it is you felt so uncomfortable. <br/><br/>It's who I am. In my job I take care of people, and I have to make them feel comfortable with me, and the non-invasive but scary medical test I perform on them. I'm pretty good at my job, and I haven't killed anyone yet. <br/><br/>I'm also a stable, likeable, friendly outgoing person who gives a shit. I have my own baggage and I can show you how to put baggage down and have real communication with people. But you have let me show you, and I guarantee, you, I, the world will be better for it. If you don't it's a loss to everyone.<br/><br/>I want to have a chance to talk to people about something I care about, so I can make it better,  make it valuable, fun, and even more accessible to people who like to bash orcs in play. I lose that chance if you're not honest about what bugs you about my work. I'm a really nice person, or so people tell me (just don't fuck with me!). I don't want to be treated like a phenomenon ("the only black woman game designer out there! The Venus Hottentot of the RPG world!). Whether anyone is willing to admit or acknowledge it, that's how many, many people's responses have made me feel. <br/><br/>How do you get more people of color and women into gaming? Talk real to us. Talk about theory. Talk honestly about what you did and didn't like about our game. And don't read race and gender where you should be reading human being, especially if the word you're reading is "human being".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96583">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96583/#Comment_96583" name="Item_88" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T11:32:22+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 11:32AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The reception of a game depends on who wrote it.

People aren't telling you to talk to Holocaust survivors (honestly, I would start with scholars of the Holocaust) because they think your work needs to be legitimated, I don't think.  They're telling you to run the game by them to see if it's a validation of their experiences and not an unintentional twisting or romanticizing of what they went through or their way of life.  Brennan's going to be dealing with some of the same issues when he gets ready to publish <i>How We Came To Live Here</i>, I think, and I really hope he contacts a few relevant Native American groups and asks if they are interested in giving him advice or reading his drafts.  Maybe they won't be interested, but making the attempt is important, I think.<br/><br/>Honestly, I can't believe the amount of crap Julia's gotten for her game.  If you compare it to the reaction to other games, even games that people have strong concerns about, it's just not comparable.  To me, it seems like Julia's constantly being asked to justify her game or explain to other people why they should play it, which seems pretty ridiculous.  If people aren't interested, that's their business.  The value and awesomeness of the game comes out in play, just like with most other games.  People asking questions about the game, because they're uncertain about some of the rules, is totally fine.  But it really grates on me when people seem to repeatedly question the basic premise of the game or Julia's motivations for creating it.<br/><br/>Honestly, because I don't know many of the people who seem strongly concerned about the game, I don't know why it seems to push their buttons and bring up serious issues for them.  It seems like issues of race and, particularly, slavery in North America are really problematic for many folks.  That's to be expected, I guess.  But I don't understand why Julia seems to have not been given the benefit of the doubt that's generally extended to most game designers in this community.  She knows what she's doing!<br/><br/>Like many initial print runs (Shock:, PTA, TSOY, etc.), there may be weaknesses in the text that Julia may or may not decide to address in future drafts.  That's entirely up to her.  But that does not make it cool to speculate about her game without really engaging with it.  If you haven't read the game, if you haven't played it, maybe it's time to take a step back from these conversations until you have personal experiences that you can draw on.  I, for one, would love to hear about people's play experiences with <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> and the kinds of difficulties, both mechanical and issue-oriented, that came up in play.  There was some really cool stuff that came up when I playtested the game at JiffyCon many months ago and I'm excited to see how the revisions she's made shift things a bit.  But I'm getting really tired of people talking about the game without having any intention of playing it and exploring what it's about.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96592">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96592/#Comment_96592" name="Item_92" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T12:13:00+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 12:13PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I hope I'm not seen as one of the people who are giving Julia "crap" for her game.

Responses to that request should prolly have been put in a new thread. It definitely took things off in a new direction.<br/><br/>I too would like to hear about first hand experiences of the game.

And I didn't mean<b>you</b>were a clod, I meant someone ready to dismiss American history as irrelevant and therefore Julia's work as pointless would be a clod.</blockquote>\nI gave this a bit more thought. While I agree with you, again, I tend to be more generous to someone who says, fairly vaguely, "it's not for me" and doesn't go too far into it. I do not think they fall into the category of someone dismissing history as irrelevant or the game as illegitimate.<br/><br/>Let me give an example from another game, basketball. If I and my buds get together at the park and shoot hoops an hour or two on the weekends, we may be having a grand old time with the great game of basketball. If someone invites us to play in a city league and we say "nah, that's not for me", it may be for any number of reasons (no drinking or boomboxes allowed, too much time investment, too competitive, etc.) or it may just be that we like the way things are and don't really feel the need to go do something very different even if it is the same activity "at the core".<br/><br/>Similarly, the average happy gamer is quite capable of turning down decent games without too much introspection, and it neither makes them wusses nor cowards nor ahistorical assholes, it just means that it sounds different enough from what they're doing that they don't want to give up a sure-thing of a fun experience for a gamble of one that might be or might not be. Remember, your average happy gamer doesn't have any incentive to puzzle out what it is about gaming they like or don't like, so the boundary is sort of fuzzy.<br/><br/>I am sure there are people who are just too uncomfortable with the subject matter to ever enjoy it, but I don't think "it's not for me" or "doesn't sound like what I'm after" is necessarily saying that.<br/><br/>There's something else here about social contract as well, something about why when someone leaping up and saying "I wanna GM a game where blah blah blah blah blah!" is different from group to group...not sure how that ties in but I'm sure it does. Someone considering a game has to consider who they're going to play it with and how and if they'll buy in.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4266/steal-away-jordans-reviews" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4266/steal-away-jordans-reviews" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4266/steal-away-jordans-reviews/p2">2</a><a class=" p-3 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4266/steal-away-jordans-reviews/p3" rel="next">3</a><a class="Next" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4266/steal-away-jordans-reviews/p3" rel="next">\xbb</a></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F4266%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F4266%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html lang="en">\n<head>\n<title>Steal Away Jordan's reviews - Page 3 - Story Games</title>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/style.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/plugins/ButtonBar/design/buttonbar.css?v=1.7.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/themes/default/design/custom.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/resources/design/vanillicon.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="/forums/applications/dashboard/design/spoilers.css?v=2.3.1" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>\n<link href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4266/steal-away-jordans-reviews/p3" rel="canonical"/>\n<meta content="article" property="og:type"/>\n<meta content="Story Games" property="og:site_name"/>\n<meta content="Steal Away Jordan's reviews - Page 3" itemprop="name" property="og:title"/>\n<meta content="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/4266/steal-away-jordans-reviews/p3" property="og:url"/>\n<meta content="Posted By: PartheniaYeah, they do, and isn't that ironic?!

My opinion is the game text is usable. I would like to see it have more advice on how to run a game, the range of playstyles, how to determine overall where the fiction will go, and more on the historical aspects. I'd also like to see rules for indentured servants, white people were slaves too. The difference is unscrupulous masters would try to work them to death, or kill them, the closer they got to finishing their 7 year term. There were also people who were Black by Law, but might have been considered White by you and I. Most places in the south kept huge genealogies and it wasn't unheard of for someone who considered themselves White to get enslaved visiting the South. I think most places considered you Black up to 1/64 African-American ancestry. They had a name for each different percentage. Anyway... everything I'd like to see is advice, or expansion. If none of those things ever happen the game is still playable as is. The mechanics are all there, and after reading this thread you should have much of the advice portion now through Julia's comments.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96743/#Comment_96743" name="Item_109" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-16T22:41:19+00:00" title="September 16, 2007 10:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>All these things about people dealing with their baggage and such is not a new concept to me.

If the writing conveyed what she had intended she wouldn't have to respond correcting people on their interpretation of the game. People obviously got the impression the game was about subjects and slaves, and she obviously didn't do much of a job to make people understand that it wasn't. Every single post here where she's clarifying or explaining things is an example of something that wasn't explained well enough (or at all) in the game manual.

Similar literary buttons to what? I thought it would be really interesting if people played Kindred. I thought playing a modern day person who finds herself in the 1800s on a plantation would be interesting, especially for a player not terribly versed in 1800's American history. . I did mention in the game text that you shouldn't play for hisotrical accuracy, but I think most of us could relate to a character who wakes up in the wrong place in the wrong time and has to muddle through her new circumstances.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy mom recommended I read Kindred when I first started writing.

It's the job of the writer to get everyone who will read it to understand it perfectly. Not just one person or a few.\n<blockquote><br/>Since you are basing your venom solely on hearsay in this thread, I expect you to take my first hand experience into account and consider how it affects your position.</blockquote>\nActually, my venom is based solely on her post where she pulled out the race card. That's not heresay. That's her words directly.<br/><br/>The point about it not being written well is basic technical writing. Know your <b>whole</b> audience. Write it so <b>everyone</b> understands it the same way. If that fails, it's purely because you screwed up. That's technical writing. Not everyone got the idea she was intending. That means she didn't write it well enough. The specifics are up for discussion. That fact isn't. That's the philosophy necessary for writing a good instruction manual. There's no being wishy-washy on it. If 100 people read a manual, 99 people get it and 1 person doesn't and that one person was part of the target audience, the writer failed.<br/><br/>Saying "I actually meant this" is addressing that. Saying people are wusses. Saying that it has to do with the cover photo. Saying it has to do with the race of the author. That's completely avoiding the fact.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96767">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia" title="Parthenia"><img alt="Parthenia" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/146/nKIT0S5D0Y5QY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Parthenia">Parthenia</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96767/#Comment_96767" name="Item_122" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T00:37:09+00:00" title="September 17, 2007 12:37AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            migo, I keep going through my purse and I can't find this race card that you speak of.  <br/>You missed the fight, dude.

I'm into that kind of thing.  I'm actually using my game prep for <i>Steal Away Jordan</i> to springboard me into some research on the early Reconstruction, the roots of the Ku Klux Klan, and the like.  Personally, my hope is to tell the story of a Virginian planter household during the Civil War and Reconstruction.  Yes, it will be primarily from the viewpoint of the slaves/freedmen, but, really, I'd like it to be an American story.

I'd love to see some of this spelled out in further detail, which could then be incorporated into a revised edition.  (Julia has <a href="http://stone-baby.com/?p=25" rel="nofollow">already started doing this</a>, by the way.)  Because, as I read the book, the supernatural elements (Haints and such) leaped out at me as being a fairly weird addition to a "historical" game.  It was like a session of <i>Cold City</i> broke out in my <i>Spione</i> game.  But then, maybe we're not talking about a historical game <i>per se</i>.

When there were no more slaves around, Alice Walker, Margaret Walker, Octavia Butler, and many other authors wrote fictional narratives, some more based in reality than others. And now, you can, too, with your friends! You have 400 years of American (North, South, Central) and Caribbean History to draw on. That's a lot of territory to cover. <br/>Kindred is so many things to so many people. Slave narratives can be like that, too. You could use Vampire to run it, but then you wouldn't be playing my game, and you'd probably explore different issues. I've actually never played Vampire, so I can't really speak with any authority about that.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Honestly I'm not sure what else you could do to get that across.

And really, who wants to play a game "about" slavery and racism? That's like playing a game "about" being slowly starved to death and then gassed.</blockquote>\nBut it's more than just slavery and race! It's telling stories about people. Someone, somewhere else who has played the game lots said this (I'm excising all the nice things he said about it): the game is also about "...problematizing (note: not victimizing) plain human accomplishments, like getting married, making a life, keeping a friend, telling the truth."<br/>I would also like to play a game about slavery and racism. I think that's just a matter of personal game playing preference. I really like dolls, and I'm writing a game (with no controversy as yet!) about scary dolls. I think there are other people who would like to tell stories about being afraid of dolls. This game is also inspired by the stories you tell around a campfire. Clearly someone likes these stories. Why not play them? \n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>Could I suggest more discussion on your part, probably on your site or blog, about the origins of the "slave narrative" as a specific genre, and maybe talk a little about the touchstone works of that genre?

I think other people who feel more passionately about Blade Runner should feel free to do Blade Runner/Steal Away Jordan hacks!

I've seen the movie a zillion times. It would be an enormous ego boost and just plain cool if someone did other speculative fiction SAJ hacks.

I think it's important, because it totally explains my hangup with the game that I came to at a glance (and perhaps Chris, too, to some degree? Though I don't know how "visually-oriented" or whatever he is. I know he's a very nice guy, though):<br/><br/>My hangup was that at a glance, my perception of the art was the slave auction, the "negro poster", the "effects of caning/whipping" picture, etc. It seemed (and this was at a glance over a month ago, so it was probably just a "first impression") was, "Wow, this game is about the horrors of slavery. Not really interested in that". Later on I find out that the cover pic is more spot-on, in all these descriptions of read-throughs and actual play. It's like a slavery slice-of-life that may have brutality, but certainly doesn't focus on it or codify that it must happen, etc. Hence my surprise, and the idea that the book in Julia's head might be different than the one I read. <br/><br/>And note that this idea was based at a glance through the book, reading a pp here and there, section headers, and seeing the art. A skim.<br/><br/>Stupid me only brings up my perceptions to her in the middle of all this crap, and not, y'know, at GenCon when I could have just walked over and asked her. Oh well, better late then never.<br/><br/>Julia mentions this:<br/><br/>"<b>So the artwork. There aren't many good pictures or images of black slaves. They generally fall into three categories from my observation: images of brutality, images of famous slaves or freed slaves in portrait like Harriet Tubman (who is at the end of the book), and racist characatures showing the happy dancing coon, his jigaboo wife, and their picininny children. Guess which two I chose and which one I avoided. I could have had some artwork made, but I really liked the LOC public domain images I found. I will put more straight portraits in the next edition, though.</b>"<br/><br/>Lightbulb. Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.<br/><br/>Now, that totally makes 100% clear-as-crystal sense. Yeah, my initial gut reaction was off, and probably more based on the art than the text. It's not as if Julia could go and invent 19th century photographs that didn't exist for the purposes of keeping the theme of the art 100% in line with the theme of the game. Also, I totally understand her wanting to stay away from the latter category of pics (yikes).<br/><br/>Anyway, I came to the conclusion that "Yeah, the art steers perceptions. Maybe later more thought can be given as to how to manipulate the art to really enhance and not sideline the true feel of the game."  And having said that, my perceptions and gut reactions were, simply, my own bag. I'm a *really* visual learner guy: On that "audial/visual/tactle" scale I was something like 10/50/40. So I pick up visual cues much more strongly than text cues. I'm wired to base judgements on visual things, and it was my problem for not following through with a deeper review of the actual text. I should have said "Sure, the art is brutal, but is that what the game is really all about?"<br/><br/>I had been noticing that the people who played the game had a different perception than the people who bought the game without being in a demo. And likewise I see a perception on people like me who used the visual cues to give us a perception of the game, while other people (perhaps better at book-retention and comprehension than visual folks) read it cover to cover and had no problem sussing out the theme and concept of the game.<br/><br/>It's slice of life, what is being called "Slave Narrative". That doesn't mean full on "horns in the air" whipping, chains, beating, cutting off of feet, "Your! *crack* Name! *crack* Is! *crack* Toby!!!! *crack*", etc. <br/><br/>And damn, I want to give it a shot now.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_96983">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96983/#Comment_96983" name="Item_144" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T15:25:03+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  3:25PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 17, 2007 3:55PM by viktor_haag.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            After re-reading my original comment, I think it's horribly long for the sentiment it conveys. To whit:<br/><br/>Julia, while I probably won't be buying or playing your game (I just don't connect much to the slave narrative genre), I do applaud that you took the time to make this game. Having more of these tightly focussed games helps us connect better as a community, share the things that we do care about, and provokes us to think about how the games we play enrich us. Your game may not find its way onto my gaming table, but your points raised in this forum have at the very least encouraged me to think about ways that my own games played present and deal with issues of person-hood, self, and freedom and, where appropriate, grapple with those issues in a more thoughtful manner.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_96994">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/96994/#Comment_96994" name="Item_145" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-17T16:18:54+00:00" title="September 17, 2007  4:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know that there's anything wrong with a game about slavery and racism, but I also like the idea of a game about people who are slaves.
