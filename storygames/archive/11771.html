I felt like the idea from the start was to take the A-Team and turn it on it's head a little. So yeah we were hired soldiers convicted for a crime we maybe did commit and on the run for our barbarism. But the silliness was doused and suddenly we were supposed to steal a biological weapon, free a Somali terrorist and blow up a German destroyer.<br/>We were no longer in the US but in a war. Politics was now involved.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 1: Avoid anything serious in the Frame.</b><br/>Especially avoid politics unless it's stupid gaming politics.<br/>Politics/Religion put every one on edge and people are not sure how crazy they should go.<br/><br/>Then we made characters and I (among others) broke the golden rule. I played a soldier.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 2: Don't play soldier characters.</b><br/>It says in the rules don't make soldiers as characters. Do you know why? Because soldiers are essentially boring robots brainwashed to do a job and killing for them is meaningless. They are dull at worst and an obnoxious cliche at best.<br/><br/>The objectives were weak themselves considering we were more than capable of completing any assignment as we were the best of the best mercenaries. But the backdrops were even weaker. We broke another golden rule. We were constantly on our own and often the only thing we could interact with was each other.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 3: Civilians = potential extra dice</b><br/>Backdrops can be cinematic, but you know what's better than cinematic? Fun. Make sure your backdrops are not just cool but also filled with potential casualties and difficulties. An empty bunker, an empty desert and an empty sea are poor backdrops. Try turning the empty bunker into a presidential press conference, the desert into a Christmas eve shopping center and the ocean into a child filled water park.<br/><br/>So it was pretty weak. Not that everyone didn't play their characters well and not that the rules were bad. It was just poor framing. Because of that there was no tension and no tension means rolling inthe target is easy. I've heard of 20 dice stacks out of game but nothing over 12 in game.<br/><br/>Some more lessons:<br/><br/><b>Lesson 4: Hell for Leather was once just a game show..</b><br/>If you're too tired to make a frame stick with the default. It's brilliant and gory and the best way to show off the system.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 5: Beginning, middle and END!!</b><br/>If you're running out of time make sure you play the finale. That's the best bit. If you don't play that you are not playing Hell for Leather.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 6: You CAN be too good</b><br/>If you're too good as a group make it harder for yourselves. Ad lib it. Take away some talents. Make felonies compulsory. Say you've got to touch the stack when rolling without knocking it over. Whatever it takes to make it tough. Too hard is much better than too easy.<br/><br/><b>Lesson 7: Don't knock it over.. Don't.. be careful.. careefffuulll.</b><br/>This is a Lesson 6 rehash but if someone is too good or if things haven't hit the fan as expected by now make it difficult for your other players. Psyching them out will ensure more tension and possibly more bloodbaths. This is also a surefire way to leave the "let's kill each other " finale variation open at end game time.<br/><br/>I hope that this helps and I am sure this is all somewhere in the rules which I have still not read since way back when. Even if it is. These are good bullet points for running a con game I think. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_263091">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian" title="Sebastian"><img alt="Sebastian" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/838/nVUKKCMFWPRML.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sebastian">Sebastian</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/263091/#Comment_263091" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-20T08:45:35+00:00" title="March 20, 2010  8:45AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hi Jason,<br/><br/>Thanks for bringing this to the Story Games forum.
