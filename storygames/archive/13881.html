I totally agree, because when I play games, I really like the fiction side of things (just a personal preference here).<br/><br/>But there are a lot of moves in both AW and Storming... that are pretty close to being "little +1s" to things. In particular, I'm thinking of the "+1 to a stat" (which I <i>do</i> actually see as a mechanical choice, as opposed to a fictional choice, and it doesn't bother me for some reason), and the stat substitution moves.<br/><br/>Those kinds of moves are close to being entirely separate from the fiction.<br/><br/>When you play AW, do you make an effort to tie those to the developing fiction and/or characterization, or do you just accept them as mechanical choices, and nothing more? If the former, how? Can you give some examples?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_314415">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314415/#Comment_314415" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-26T10:10:52+00:00" title="February 26, 2011 10:10AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 26, 2011 12:09PM by Orlando_Wilson.">edited February 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The plus +1 to a stat is, like the +1harm, often looked at as purely mechanical thing. But the emphasis is in the wrong place. When you take those moves it's because you character meets those descriptors. They are a <b>Fucking Wacknut</b> or <b>Bloodcrazed</b>, and if that doesn't suit your character than, for the love of Vx, don't take them. As a MC, play-up those choices. <br/><br/>As for the stat subs, it changes the moves in subtle ways. The Brainer doesn't push out her tits and lick her lips - she's not Hot. What that scarred, skinny and scary little thing does is know your secret desires, or forces you to be inexplicably and painfully turned on - even if you shouldn't be. Seducing someone with Weird isn't the same in the fiction as doing it with Hot. You mindfuck them. It's creepy as hell. <br/><br/>The other reason you should always lead with the fiction is that the playbooks aren't 'balanced' in any way, really. So, don't worry about balance or mechanical power, worry about the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_314419">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/314419/#Comment_314419" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-26T10:53:53+00:00" title="February 26, 2011 10:53AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Orly</cite>The Brainer doesn't push out her tits and lick her lips - she's not Hot.

I don't think it's Unnatural Lust Transfixion. I think Spike and Buff are just two PCs. Spike is being all seductive, which at the moment means being violent and broody. His player says what he wants "Buffy's love and sex, yeah." Buffy's PC is like "Fuck that, no way!" and the MC's like and the fire is you're own fear of being a monster just like him. Again, Buffy's PC is like, "Fuck you, I'm not afraid of anything." And marks experience instead. <br/><br/>Or something. Buffy wants Spike but hate herself for it. <br/><br/>I think if there are moves involved, Joe, they're from Monsterhearts and not AW.
