This is a potential problem of <i>all</i> games, from Chess to story-games. In designing board games, I've discovered that I work under one unspoken assumption: Players want to win.<br/><br/>To put a finer point on it: A player will engage in this activity in order to pursue victory according to the activity's defined victory conditions. Once that assumption is altered, like one player pursuing a stalemate instead of victory, the game breaks. If one player just gives up and doesn't put in any effort at all, the game breaks. Some games are more susceptible to this than others, but even with my admittedly limited experience I'd say it could be common weakness to all games.<br/><br/>This is most definitely a concern I'm facing in RPGs, where in-game actions are far less strictly controlled than in the board game medium. A designer can place firewalls and fail-safes in a game's design to prevent jerky behavior. Or she could just throw up her hands and refer to the "Don't be a dick" mantra. The former can easily lead to lots of needlessly complicated exceptions-based designs. The latter, to me, has a certain sense of resignation.<br/><br/>Where do your designs commonly fall in this spectrum? Do you put a lot of effort considering potential dickish behavior, then designing rules to prevent that from happening? Do you just design what you want to design, assuming that players won't be jerks?<br/><br/>I've done certainly done both in a variety of games, but I'm curious how you handle it.<br/><br/>(Oh, and we're assuming here that players have already made an effort to follow the axiom, "Don't play with jerks," but some circumstance has nevertheless brought a jerk to the table.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93370">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93370/#Comment_93370" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T06:41:43+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  6:41AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mostly, I completely assume that the players won't be jerks.

The line is fuzzy, but "don't be a dick" isn't a blanket justification if your game has mechanical consequences for valid actions that end up in a bad game outcome.<br/><br/>Example: the PC in a dungeon crawl is allowed to have many goals, and one explicitly valid and encouraged goal is: get through the dungeon. The mechanics give them specific ways of handling problems in the dungeon. If the game as written "breaks" if a PC is to effective in using the mechanics to get through the dungeon, that's a kind of wierd place, or at least a difficult balance, because their goal has to be "try to get through the dungeon, but not too much, especially if X or Y or Z, in which case try to not be so successful at getting through the dungeon". Isn't the flipside of this - the DM in D&amp;D has to challenge the players, and it has to be a real challenge, but it can't be too challenging - one of the more difficult balances, as well?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93383">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mythusmage" title="mythusmage"><img alt="mythusmage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mythusmage">mythusmage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93383/#Comment_93383" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T07:01:29+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  7:01AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Graham W,<br/>\n<br/>\nThe jerk's going to take it personal anyway, don't worry about him.

I think I actually pursue jerkish behavior. I push for competition between players because I think that kind of play allows them more ownership. Some real stakes to be involved. In Contract Work, anyone who sits out of the excitement will have to give their reward away to other players and "lose." This also means I may promote jerk behavior. We'll see if CW ever demolishes a friendship.<br/><br/>I like Risk. I've never won a game in my life, but I still like it. I like Monopoly. Again, I've never won a game in my life, etc., etc. Midway through any game of Risk, I stop trying to win, recognizing that I won't, and instead I try to make life "interesting" for the other players. Within reason of course. I spread the antagonism around and don't hammer on any one player.<br/><br/>I've seen this same behavior in RPGs at most cons, ESPECIALLY at the story-gamey tables. Players want to complicate things for each other to make a more elaborate story. Are they jerks? No. We know they mean well. We trust them as fellows. Each group has their own degree of commitment to this idea. They can become actors who step away from their role when the books close if they trust each other.<br/><br/>Sure, we can write rules about this, but I think it mostly is the purview of the GM to choose games that will suit the trust and commitment of their group. More rules regulating interaction for loose friends or people who devote themselves to a character and don't separate their character's lives from their own. Open systems with more opportunities for a close-knit group who want to have a passing entertainment in which their greater investment is in the story, not their avatar.<br/><br/>I think I wandered far from the true topic. Maybe I'll spin-off some of this stuff.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93404">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93404/#Comment_93404" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T07:34:02+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  7:34AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Russell: Creating adversity isn't jerky (in a vacuum).

Because, as far as I can tell, that's what you're talking about.<br/><br/>If so, can we then dump "jerk" from the discussion?<br/><br/>Because what I'm seeing is the horrible min/maxer muchkin debate:<br/><br/>Someone who wants "story" complains about a person who min/max their character in D&amp;D or Champions.  The "story" guy calls the  min/maxer a jerk.  But, of course, the rules <i>reward</i> min/maxing.  So, the min/maxer isn't a jerk, it's just that we've got ill-defined victory conditions, with people pulling in two different directions.  And so people <i>pull out the word jerk</i>.  <br/><br/>Now, sometimes people are jerks.  But from your second quote I'm seeing that I don't think that's what you're talking about.<br/><br/>I <i>think</i> you're talking about, "How do a make sure my rules are clear about the game's victory conditions so that people don't end up calling each other jerks."<br/><br/>Other than that, as others have said, jerks are jerks.

In board games, I've occasionally run across a problem where a player can choose to go to a stalemate and his opponent has no recourse except to trust that the stalemating player will at some point choose to pursue victory once more.<br/><br/>For a storygamish example, I've got a section in Do's character creation where another player-character remembers an anecdote of your childhood exploits. I intended to make this anecdote the source of your traits, a la the 50 word paragraph in The Pool.<br/><br/>However, in considering potential jerkish behavior, I realized you could get screwed pretty bad if that player either wasn't feeling inspired or if you had contrary ideas about the character. (Nevermind if the player writing the anecdote was just a plain jerk.)<br/><br/>I implemented a couple solutions to this:\n<ul>\n<li>Distribute anecdote duties: Instead of one player remembering big-ass anecdote, three players take turns writing little mini-memories. This mitigates a single player's influence, allows more group contribution, and gives you some more variety in choosing your character's skills.</li>\n<li>Structure the anecdotes: Each player's anecdote focuses on one of three words. The first player remembers your Courage, the second remembers your Power and and the third remembers your Wisdom. (These words were totally ripped off of the Triforce in Zelda.) The words are clear enough to provide a groundwork for the little mini-story, but ambiguous enough to give some creative breathing room.</li>\n<li>Explain what the anecdotes are meant to communicate: This wasn't so much a design adjustment as a matter of more clearly writing the goals for this step in character creation: "These memories reveal how your companion showed Courage, Power and Wisdom worthy of leaving the temple and going on the Pilgrimage." That line provides further structure, focusing on the positive, heroic aspects of each character.</li>\n</ul>\nI could've just said "don't be a jerk when you're writing an anecdote for your friend's character," but then I wouldn't have found these very fun little mini-game elements and it wouldn't have shown me how I could more clearly write my rules.<br/><br/>EDIT: Christopher makes a good point, I'll refrain from using "jerk" henceforth in this discussion.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93411/#Comment_93411" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T07:45:01+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  7:45AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: C.W.Richeson</cite>What game mechanics are out there that deal well with the 'jerk problem'?</blockquote>\nIIRC, a lot of <i>Burning Wheel</i> was designed to address dickweed behavior, as mentioned by Luke in the game text and elsewhere.

Everyone is assuming here that you're talking about playing with people who are just being jerks and ruining everyone's fun (intentionally or not).  I think that's different than someone who simply isn't playing to win, and thereby breaking your game.<br/><br/>As an example, Jason and I often end up playing in games where our friends play to lose.  They are not "success oriented", which can make it difficult for other players who are.  So we're playing a team of secret agents, trying to infiltrate a high-security facility.  We've slipped past the lasers, hacked the retinal scanners, and we've got the secret plans in hand.  Then Mike says "uh, as we exit the room, I trip over the door jamb and roll down the stairs, landing at the feet of the now alerted guards!  They start kicking me!"<br/><br/>Now is that dickery, or is he just complicating the situation for fun?  Is it fun for everybody, or was he just personally bored with success and trying to liven things up for himself?<br/><br/>Put another way, sometimes playing to lose is a legitimate player strategy if the ultimate goal is to have a good time.  If you're looking to design rules that don't break under that kind of pressure, you'll have to set your game up to give everybody room for their own kind of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93413">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/buzz" title="buzz"><img alt="buzz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/213/nP1HB8M2UZ5RU.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/buzz">buzz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93413/#Comment_93413" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T07:46:16+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  7:46AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Daniel, do you have any examples of "encouraging jerkiness" rules?</blockquote>\nRule 0/Golden Rule.

Also, a group of players, or a selection of players might not even think of that playstyle (begging the whoops?) as "losing," but actually that the point of the game is to add as much complication and spice and struggle to their characters lives.

However, the "players want to win" assumption related to my board game designs, not necessarily my RPGs. Though it could be fairly  said that I approach both from a board game designer's perspective. ^_^<br/><br/>As has been pointed out eloquently by others on this thread, it's when players are deliberately playing towards different, mutually exclusive types of enjoyment that each finds the other to be a "jerk."<br/><br/>Your example is one where I think it's a tough design goal to make the systemic victory different from the fictional victory. A success-oriented player would be just as quick to trip over his own feet during the mission if it were clear that doing so pushed him closer to the system's rewards. However, the disconnect between the system and fiction might be difficult to reconcile. (That might be beyond the scope of rules on their own.)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Suddenly, I'm reminded of the episode of South Park where the kids are forced to play little league softball and they keep trying to lose so they don't have to play anymore. Unfortunately, all the other teams are trying to lose, too. They eventually get deeply involved in the strategy of baseball, but only because they want to get the heck out. :P                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93445">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jzn" title="jzn"><img alt="jzn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jzn">jzn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93445/#Comment_93445" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T09:18:28+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  9:18AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited September 6, 2007 9:19AM by jzn.">edited September 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>Russell: Creating adversity isn't jerky (in a vacuum).

Your example of the player who doesn't know his own play style is also very interesting. Assuming you follow the first two assumptions, then it seems that the third step is meant to address those players in particular.<br/><br/>As for the non-competitive gamer in a competitive game: I remember I had a GURPS GM who <i>proudly</i> told me stories about how his character would examine every piece of art in a dungeon while everyone else was slaying orcs and taking their stuff.

I've just come from high school RPG experience almost completely consisting of running Traveller in a highly "secret agent mission" mode: here is the mission, go do it.  One of the people in the group is Chris (a person that now, 20+ years later, is one of my dearest friends in the world).  He is playing a thief.  I'm playing a Paladin (because that was me, then).  We fight some monsters.  We get some treasure.  Chris says "I'm going to pick Hans's character's pocket and steal some of his treasure."  I totally blow my stack...what the?!  Your stealing from me?  We are team, for criminy's sake!  Chris says "hey, I'm a thief...its what we do."  I appeal to the GM, and the GM does NOTHING about this!  Man I was playing with total jerks...<br/><br/>Except...on reflection I think I was the jerk.  Or, perhaps more charitably to me, no one was a jerk.  All this was was an example of most everyone at the table playing one game, and me playing a different game and suddenly realizing I wasn't playing the same game as everyone else, and moreover, HATED the game that everyone else was playing.  My REACTION to that realization was probably jerky, but the fact that I hated it was just an item of my then personality.  I was an "accidental jerk", as JZN and Mikael discuss above.<br/><br/>I'm guessing this isn't what Daniel is talking about.  Let me define "jerk" in the context of role-playing games:\n<blockquote>JERK.  noun.  A player who values their own input into the game at the expense of the enjoyment of the other players.</blockquote>\nGiven that definition, I'm not certain what mechanics COULD exist to alleviate the effect of a jerk on a game.<br/><br/>However, another anecdote:<br/><br/>I'm running TROS on Monday night for my regular TROS group.  The players in that group are all people that come from very sim-heavy traditional game backgrounds, mostly sim-style D&amp;D, with character immersion being the primary definition of role-playing.  Two of the characters in the game have radically different religious perspectives, as represented by their Spiritual Attributes.  I, either mistakenly or otherwise, framed a situation in which these perspectives were in conflict with each other.  And then...things got out of hand.  Both players were heavily into "what would my guy do" and had very narrow intepretations of that, and I could see that we were heading for a bad situation, TROS style (i.e. throw your red or white die between two players).  We were playing through things, and then I sort of held up my hand and said (I paraphrase) "Ok, guys, I'm being honest with you.  You are both role-playing perfectly.  You are doing exactly what your characters would do in this situation, which is fantastic.  Except...if you keep doing it this way, we are going to end up with a situation in which NO ONE WILL HAVE FUN.  The thing you think is fun is...well, not fun in this situation.  I'm going to ask you both, as players, to talk this over, and see if you can come up with some resolution that both satisfies your thoughts on what your characters will do AND makes sure that both of your characters survive this."  I think suggested what seemed to me to be a high-level narrative compromise to the situation as an outcome, which both players accepted.<br/><br/>Were these players being jerks?  In a way, they were, by my definition above.  They were valuing their own input ("What my guy would do") at the expense of the enjoyment of the other players ("What my guy would do is leading to a no-fun place").  But I honestly don't think they were being jerks, really.  Their intent was not to be jerks, because they were NOT THINKING ABOUT ENJOYMENT in that moment.  Really, they weren't.  Enjoyment had nothing to do with what was going on.  I could see in both of their faces that they weren't ENJOYING where they could see things were going, but they honestly felt they had to keep going there to be good role-players.  <br/><br/>Much of this was my fault...I know very well that TROS doesn't handle conflict whose ultimate arbiter isn't sword play to the death very well, and I knew that inter-player conflict wasn't really what the group was into.  So maybe I was the jerk in the situation above; I valued my own input (a cool scene frame) over the enjoyment of the other players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/timfire" title="timfire"><img alt="timfire" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/timfire">timfire</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93497/#Comment_93497" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T11:20:05+00:00" title="September  6, 2007 11:20AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I have a couple "anti-jerk" rules.

I don't necessarily have one particular playstyle I enjoy the most, although like all people I have my habits and recurring tropes.<br/><br/>Buzz -- right on about Rule Zero!  Down with Rule Zero!  To expand on this point, here's a specific example of a rule that encourages dickishness:  Paladins lose their powers if they violate the tenets of the Lawful Good alignment.  This leads to all sorts of arguments about the exact definition of the alignment, etc.  Furthermore, it also confuses the game's goals:  is the game about temptation / being lead astray, is it the GM's *job* to try to "make" the Paladin lose his powers?<br/><br/>Vincent, Luke, and many other indie designers have deliberately set out to avoid those types of unpleasant situations, where the system encourages one of the players to arbitrarily pass judgment on the others, and have done so quite successfully.  So, yes, I think obnoxious behavior can be guarded against with good design.  Are there people with whom one Just Shouldn't Game?  Sure.  But most people aren't like that if they get into a good, clearly-designed game.  I sure wouldn't want to game with, well, me, back when I was playing 2E D&amp;D.  But put me in a game of 3E D&amp;D, and I'll hack-and-slash with the best of them.  Put me in a game of PTA, and I'll frame scenes and contribute interesting narration as best I can, and completely drop my tactical viewpoint.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O" title="Thor_O"><img alt="Thor_O" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thor_O">Thor_O</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93506/#Comment_93506" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T11:45:39+00:00" title="September  6, 2007 11:45AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't be a dick is part of the social contract.

No game rule is going to fix a situation like that.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there are always going to be ways in games that allow players to do something that has the potential to make another player really unhappy -- without intending to do it. Rules can be written to smooth over these danger spots.<br/><br/>Let It Ride is an example. Many GMs don't realize that they are massively affecting a player's chance of succeeding by calling for a series of tests, all of which must be successful. Let It Ride just cuts that out.<br/><br/>The Connection Die in Burning Empires is another. Psychologists in the game are given the power to invade other characters' minds and even rewrite their Beliefs, Instincts and Traits. The Connection Die is there to create a set of Permissions and Expectations. The <i>player</i> has to give permission to the possibility of a rewriting, and is rewarded for doing so. But it happens with the expectation that the character may get screwed over in the future.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ross" title="ross"><img alt="ross" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://pics.livejournal.com/ross_winn/pic/0000syzd"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ross">ross</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93520/#Comment_93520" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T12:38:07+00:00" title="September  6, 2007 12:38PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DanielSolis</cite>Here's my problem with "don't play with jerks."</blockquote>\nA fantastic point, and something that shouldn't be ignored.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93521/#Comment_93521" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T12:41:48+00:00" title="September  6, 2007 12:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Don't play with jerks, but also don't mechanically incentivize jerkdom.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93529">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93529/#Comment_93529" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T13:06:26+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  1:06PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am a jerk on the Internet, and sometimes in real life, but not in gaming!<br/><br/>It is a mystery.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93532">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93532/#Comment_93532" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T13:18:22+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  1:18PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [JoshBishopRoby and I talk about this all the time -- designing to meet your needs vs. the audience's needs. My opinion is most likely unpopular.]<br/><br/>The jerk exists, even in the best players, whether or not you acknowledge it. The jerk is the part of the gamer that looks for an opening, an attempt to gain a foothold in the story over others. Some games encourage this without knowing it. A fair amount of the games that get discussed on this site barter in the sale of alpha-dogism, the player who talks the most or the fastest gets to "win."<br/><br/>The session of Executive Decision I played in this weekend had a huge jerk at the table, who just about ruined the experience, but could not be abridged in his crappy behavior because the game didn't say, "shut up and give everyone a chance to talk." Toward the end of the game, I was outright yelling at him to shutup, but that didn't fix the previous 3-hours of fun that he had run over with his truck.<br/><br/>And not every gamer wants to argue about every violation of the social contract, every time. The GM or the rules should guard against a player's fun and involvement being slighted by the rest of the players.... or one specific jerk... but often this is not the case. Task resolution aside, everyone gets a turn every round in tradition games. Some story games are extremely free-form, providing room for the marginalizing of others.<br/><br/>A designer that does not at least consider this during design is forgetting that not every gamer is him or her.<br/><br/>Paul Tevis was telling a story at Gateway about a group of Polaris players who always talk so loud that the one player who "brings the awesome" never gets to talk. None of them are "jerks" in the definitive sense, but if a free-form game allows you to talk over me, then the core rules are already in violation of the social contract. Right?<br/><br/>As an aside, GMs are guilty of jerkism too, removing the fun from a game by railroading their own agendas, ignoring rules they don't like, calling for too many "spot checks," or forgetting about all the players in the pursuit of the one (player) agenda at the table that they like.<br/><br/>Games that allow me to "interrupt" with my action points or resources are vastly better in this regard to stopping a player from being ignored by the game play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93536">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93536/#Comment_93536" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-06T13:40:10+00:00" title="September  6, 2007  1:40PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>Task resolution aside, everyone gets a turn every round in tradition games.</blockquote>\nDo you mean "in combat"?

This got discussed in some detail in a heated debate between myself (and Ralph Mazza) with Tony LB, with regards to whether or not something like the challenge mechanic in Universalis is a good idea. Tony's argument was (and he'll correct me if I'm wrong), that the challenge rule isn't neccessary, because if you don't play with jerks, you can always just accept each other's contributions. <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I agree with you that you can't always do so, and still have fun. Even if the other player's are not jerks. And that's because, despite even the best attempts by players to accomodate the needs of other players playing, sometimes people make additions to the game that we don't appreciate for whatever reason. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, yes, sometimes this is specifically beacuse we're being selfish, and not paying attention to the needs of the other players. I'd argue, however, that this really isn't being a jerk. At best, it's unintentional jerkism, if you will. A true jerk, one that's really violating the social contract, is one that does so because he really doesn't care about the needs of the other players. <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can't hold a player to be 100% accountable for successfully taking into account the needs of the other players. Or even 80%. Why? Because we're human. And to that extent, I argue, it's important to have methods of feedback that allow players to communicate well to each other what they want, and give players an equal voice. The system should be democratic. <br/>\n<br/>\nCreating a rule to facilitate this sort of communication, a rule like the PTA fanmail rule, for instance, is not a rule to prevent real jerkism. Because it won't actually fix real jerkism. A real jerk won't care if they get fanmail in PTA, they'll relish the fact that they're getting away with whatever they're getting away with. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is where the line has to be drawn in terms of these behaviors. Is the player somebody who, if they understand the needs of the other players will negotiate to come up with a result that's satisfactory for everybody? Or are they somebody who either can't be communicated with, or can be, but who won't accomodate the desires of the other players? <br/>\n<br/>\nYou can write rules to addess the player who is well-intentioned, but imperfect (though Tony might argue that such rules are unneccessary, and basic communication skills will always suffice). You can't write rules to address the true jerk. You just have to avoid playing with him (or, if you're somehow amazing, change their behavior). <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93694">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93694/#Comment_93694" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T10:15:44+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 10:15AM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just wanted to thank y'all for your keen insights, despite my vaguely worded original post. ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93735">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93735/#Comment_93735" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T12:04:16+00:00" title="September  7, 2007 12:04PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I figured people would disagree with my generalities.

Here is my recipe for a good gaming group:<br/><br/>Ingredients:  <br/> (A) Three to five (3-5) friends ... people you like, as people, independent of anything you're doing.  Often the highest quality friends are not found in the "Gamer" section of your local person-market.<br/> (B) One (1) game.<br/><br/>Mix all ingredients liberally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93782">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93782/#Comment_93782" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T13:47:25+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  1:47PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to second Jim's notion of designing to smooth out the wrinkles caused by "unintentional jerkism". In my experience, if you're designing a game to facilitate understanding between parties that may approach the game from different angles, you don't need to put quite as much effort into finding gamers that think <i>exactly as you do</i>.<br/><br/>For example, there are some problems with this in our GURPS game because GURPS has no explicit mechanics for flagging or inter-player rewards. But we play Spirit of the Century with roughly the same group, and such problems are nowhere to be found. I'd like to attribute this at least in part to the fact that we have a much better understanding of what the other players want out of the game when we can see (at least) ten very clear flags on their sheet.<br/><br/>I don't like the advice "just avoid all the jerks" because I'm convinced most people aren't jerks. Design and play games that facilitate a shared understanding of the Social Contract, and you won't have to switch groups as often.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93785">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr" title="Lxndr"><img alt="Lxndr" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/803/nRIOJTW5OT0WE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lxndr">Lxndr</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93785/#Comment_93785" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T13:51:57+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  1:51PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not really the size of the hobby.  I've noticed one's ability to (1) get groups to game is roughly porportional to one's ability (2) to gather groups of people in the first place.  Since I don't have the latter ability, it's difficult for me to get the a gaming group. I'm lucky to be in one right now.<br/><br/>But yeah, all the size of the hobby in one's local area does is make it easier to do 1 (get a gaming group) without getting any better at 2 (meet people) thanks to the networking ability of game stores.  Since I'll probably never get better at 2, I like to be in an area where I have ways to take advantage of the relative ease of 1.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_93792">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93792/#Comment_93792" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T14:01:02+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  2:01PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What's worse is that if you wrote a section called "don't be a jerk," most people would assume it wasn't written for them anyway and would ignore it.<br/>\n<br/>\nThat's human nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nI wrote an outline for a book once that was "advice for players" (not GMs) and everyone agreed that it was an important book and then agreed that no one that needed to read it, would.<br/>\n<br/>\nPamphlets titled "What to do to avoid colon cancer"  probably get ignored by teenagers.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_93814">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lachek" title="lachek"><img alt="lachek" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/425/nD0G7E7WMWAQL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lachek">lachek</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/93814/#Comment_93814" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-09-07T14:41:59+00:00" title="September  7, 2007  2:41PM">September 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jim pinto</cite>I wrote an outline for a book once that was "advice for players" (not GMs) and everyone agreed that it was an important book and then agreed that no one that needed to read it, would.</blockquote>\nDamn - I've been looking for that book!
