You know, the kind of date where you feel things could eventually get serious and stuff.<br/><br/>Then, afterwards, I realized that, as I was remembering the different moments of the date, I started thinking about it as a game session of Breaking the Ice. I kept looking for our scenes, rerolls, attraction dice...<br/><br/>Then it stuck me. I do that all the time. Thinking about things in real life as if they were in a game. Trying to figure out atributes, stadistics, mechanics. How many hitpoints that guy would have. How badly they failed their conflict roll. How creative the GM was to narrate the scene with so much color... Seeing stuff in game terms. (In fact thinking about the movie Matrix Reloaded as if it was a game was what first catapulted me into game design.)<br/><br/>I know some of my gaming buddies do that too. In an intentional, funny, tongue-in-cheek way. But I am curious. Do many people do it like me (in a casual and unintentional way)?<br/><br/>It's not that I'm too concerned about it. I don't think I am anyway near an obsessive fanatism or anything. I just find it funny, and am curious about what other people think. And it do would be nice to know I'm not the only one.<br/><br/>So what do you think, people? Do you do it too? In an intentional or an unintentional way? What is your favorite "In X game that would work like this" moment? Which are the games you think about most often?<br/><br/>(BTW, after my date, we earned several connection and a lot of attraction dice, which is an impressive feat, both in game terms and in real life. <img alt=":D" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/lol.png" title=":D"/>)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_189056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arturo%20G." title="Arturo G."><img alt="Arturo G." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arturo%20G.">Arturo G.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/189056/#Comment_189056" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-01-19T14:14:58+00:00" title="January 19, 2009  2:14PM">January 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Please, Tristan, don't ask her to do the attraction rolls for you!! :-)<br/><br/>I never do it, except as a plain and clear joke when we are all gamers around, taking a break to buy a pizza in a nearby restaurant.

In good shows, we talk about how much which players must be enjoying themselves during different episodes and how awesome certain players are to take a hit for the time, or how great the GM must be. We frequently think of our gaming buddies and discus which characters are whose "type" of character, or are played in a way that reminds us of ourselves or our friends (On Heroes, for example, either Matt Parkman or Hiro Nakamura is totally my character - my girlfriend says so). For shows that are disintegrating, we imagine the mistakes the players and GMs are making, or how their social group might be falling apart (to continue the above metaphor, the GM of Heroes is banging either Sylar's player or Peter's player, or both, and Noah stopped being a PC a while ago - we think his player got sick of this shit and ditched).<br/><br/>I know.
