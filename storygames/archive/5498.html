Each character also has a specific "Remember the time when..." connection to one other character.  <br/><br/>2) Niche protection and specialization.  I'm thinking about 4 key roles would be good, and I can put that right in the stats.<br/>b) While niches are protected, Resolution rewards action where PCs work together.<br/><br/>3) Play the same characters over a long period.*<br/>a) I want to reward long term play with increased effectiveness, and characters who grow together are a great source of camaraderie.<br/>b) However, a real sense of risk is also important.  I'm almost certain I'll use my Death Flag rules in this game.<br/><br/>4) Player control of level of adversity, which GM has the job of bringing on.  Thus the GM is in the service of the players.  However, the players have strong incentives to choose higher levels of adversity.<br/><br/>5) Situations should involve the PCs' necks being on the line against a threat that can only be defeated collectively, or illustrate the difference in qualitative outcomes between a group and a solo effort.  Situations should relate to group goals, with individual character goals being less important or unstated.<br/><br/>* This is the hardest one on the list IMO.  I'm trying to get "sit down, get camaraderie" out of the game in each session.  So obviously I want it to work even if it's not long-term play.  But the fact remains that people get a strong sense of camaraderie from long-term play in the same group, and I can't control how often these groups play.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_123329">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123329/#Comment_123329" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-01-31T09:29:22+00:00" title="January 31, 2008  9:29AM">January 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well I guess with reference to (3) you are setting up character creation to give the feeling, like SOTC, that the characters have been together for a long time already, even before play begins. So you are getting halfway there, make the players feel like they are already in the middle of a long play session.<br/><br/>Is there a way you can capture the other end? i.e. can you make the players feel that their adventures are continuing even when they stop playing, so they feel they have been in the middle of a big arc even if they only play one game?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_123909">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/123909/#Comment_123909" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-02T06:24:09+00:00" title="February  2, 2008  6:24AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't know how to solve that question.  My only thought was that you could win some kind of "what happens next" stakes.  Maybe something where you can help author other players' characters' futures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
