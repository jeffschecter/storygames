Here's what I posted in the Bite-size thread:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>Had a character creation session for Empire of Dust last night. 3 Alliance PC's ended up consisting of:<br/><br/>-An Engineer who trained under Dr. William Kimo himself, has black level R&amp;D clearance and is serving as the intelligence element of this particular group<br/>-The Autumnstar, a Mage from Exodus Tower who is leading this rag-tag band and doesn't even realize his looming destiny<br/>-A Bruta Gunknight who rides into battle atop his mighty Duar mount leveling buildings with his devastating rail-gun<br/><br/>We rolled up a random mission and they will be attempting to track down a spy who has gathered some integral information related to Kimo Labs. Thinking about having the spy headed to Morus Albus (a Mercenary hive with no law) in an attempt to meet with the Legion on Neutral ground. Should be interesting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: agony</cite>We played our first actual session last Sunday and it was fun. I gave the mission briefing which entailed an intercepted message concerning the exchange of information. The message came from within Kimo Labs near Lagerstrom which confirmed the suspicion of an enemy spy.<br/><br/>I then gave the Engineer two hand-outs of the possible suspects. Both scientists were unaccounted for and could be the insider heading to Morus Albus to meet with an outside entity.<br/><br/>The PC's were shot-down from their Dropship to the north of Havenstad, captured a Legion Dune Sled and arrived in the neutral city of Morus Albus which I depicted as basically the town from Yojimbo (larger scale though).<br/><br/>We continue tomorrow as the PC's are ready to ambush the information exchange.</blockquote>\nWe played again last night although the Bruta player didn't show.  We NPC'd him.<br/><br/>I'm seriously loving the randomness of this game - particularly Time Lapses and Random Encounters.  The session kick-started with the meet between the Kimo Labs Insider and his contact in Morus Albus.  This occurred in a slum area of the city and was the perfect place for an ambush.  Unfortunately, the Engineer PC failed a tech roll to lock-in on the enemy's signal deck and intercept any transmitted messages last session.  This caused the signal deck owner (the Mercenary leader the insider was meeting with) to know he was being tracked and expect the ambush. <br/><br/>The ambush turned into a clusterfuck as the PC's spotted the meeting going down in the middle of the square - yet found themselves being approached by Mercs from their rear.  A large battle broke out where the Merc leader in the square grabbed Dr. Buchanan (the insider) and attempted to use him as cover.  Before things got too hairy Devin the Damned unleashed his Autmnstar ability without his own knowledge.  Fissures formed in the earth and buildings crumbled as a massive earthquake tore up the slum, wounding every single participant in the combat except for himself and Dr. Buchanan.  Devin quickly nabbed the Doctor and escaped with his friends in a quad car the Mercenaries brought to the meeting.  Unfortunately they left the Mercenary leader alive and stirring to consciousness.<br/><br/>The city was basically in an uproar as word quickly spread of the firefight and thugs began to mobilize.  The PC's hauled ass out of town, driving through a roadblock and dealing with harrassing gunfire before breaking away and making their escape.  The battle to escape Morus Albus was reminiscent of many of the Humvee scenes in "Generation Kill" as they took fire from stray assault rifles and thrown molotov cocktails all the while returning their own fury from the windows of their car.  There was also a cool moment here where Cedric attempted to fire his Kimo Labs prototype grenade launcher but rolled a 20 causing it to backfire.  The whole back-seat of the quadcar was lit up in a hellacious explosion of C_ore energy and broken glass.<br/><br/>The PC's escape and made their way back to Lagerstrom - discovering the town of Havenstad had been seized by the Alliance during their raid on Morus Albus.  After debriefing and handing off Dr. Buchanan, the PC's headed to Exodus Tower for training and so that Devin could determine what the hell was going on with himself after that incident at the ambush site.  We also had a brief scene with Cedric meeting with Dr. Kimo where he shared the footage of Devin's horrific earthquake outburst.  Cedric has a built-in signal deck (PDA like communications device) and we determined he recorded the whole incident as he fell to the ground from the violent seizing of the quake.  Dr. Kimo tells Cedric to keep an eye on Devin as the unnatural readings from the incident display a unique phenomena they have never seen.<br/><br/>Finally, we had an interlude at Exodus Tower where the group trained and Devin sought advice from Balthazar the Wise - the head Mage of the Alliance.  Balthazar made Devin aware of the Valien prophecy of the Autumnstar and suggested that Devin meet with a local member of the Valien Circle in the nearby town.  Devin refuses to believe in what the Valien preach and never meets with any members of the Valien Council.<br/><br/>After the player of Cedric Vale decided he wanted to make a new character (a Valien Auger who is pursuing Devin after having strange dreams) we had the final scene with Devin retrieving Cha-Tac and Sampson (an NPC Alliance soldier) and heading out towards Havenstad to support the Alliance front.  Balthazar made it clear that Kimo Labs should not be completely trusted so Devin left Cedric behind (who is now an NPC).  When the group arrived outside of Havenstad they saw the city lit up with fire as fierce house-to-house fighting was underway.  The Legion had regrouped and counter-attacked and it looked like the city was about to fall yet again (this was determined with another Time Lapse roll).<br/><br/>It's quite interesting have a character who doesn't know he is the Autumnstar and is taking on that reluctant hero role.  I see play largely heading into Devin's internal battle of dealing with such pressure while combating outside forces wishing him dead/captured.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233750">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233750/#Comment_233750" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T17:04:58+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  5:04PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Third session was last night.  All 3 players were there this time and we were primed to introduce J's new character (the Valien Auger - he was previously playing the Engineer).<br/><br/>The PC's descended into the war-torn streets of Havenstad which was now undergoing its 3rd armed assault in as many months.  What was once a grand, beautiful, sprawling metropolitan area had become little more than rubble where blood would be spilled and good men would be sacrificed in the name of glory.  The motley crew of a Mage, Bruta Gunknight, and soon to be arriving Valien Auger would hopefully avoid the sacrifice part.<br/><br/>Making their way through the streets, the Devin and Cha-Tac ran into an Alliance Sgt. attempting to restore some semblance of order to the evacuating Alliance forces and civillian refugees.  He directed the group towards Alliance command's last known position and off they went.  <br/><br/>Cutting north through the city the group arrived at a firefight between what appeared to be the last remaining elements of Alliance HQ and a pursuing Legion infantry company.  The group attempted to flank and ambush the advancing Legion forces but failed their navigation roll, allowing a squad of War Devils to approach the PC's from the rear - stealthed.  The key piece of the battle was a Legion hover tank which had been immobilized, but still possessed a working main gun.  The War Devil infantry flanked the tank in the wide street, pouring hell on the retreating Alliance troops.  <br/><br/>This was an amazing battle.  I placed the stipulations on the fight that when the battle was over we would roll a Fate roll to see if the Alliance HQ would make it out relatively intact.  Every round the PC's delayed the Legion forces would add 1 to the Fate roll.  E.g. if they last 5 rounds before fleeing it would be a roll of 13.<br/><br/>Another element which made the street battle interesting was the arrival of the J's new character, the Valien Auger Syrus who wielded dual blades and could stealth in plain sight (active camo equipment).  Syrus arrived on the opposite end of the battlefield escorting an Alliance Anti-tank team.  The PC's ended up winning the battle, taking out the tank and only receiving a single casualty - an NPC by the name of Samson (see previous posts).  They briefly lamented Samson's death before retreating and following what remained of the HQ convoy.  <br/><br/>After a brief escape to the nearby hillside, the PC's gained a moment of respite as they trudged through the staging ground of what was left of the Alliance forces.  The wounded appeared to outnumber those fit for duty and it became painfully obvious that a full-fledged counter-attack would not likely occur.  Despite this fact, Devin the Damned attempted to muster a small squad to head back into the city and attempt to reinforce the remaining Alliance armor elements trapped in sector 27.  Some interesting moments of roleplay appeared as Syrus the Auger attempted to convince Alliance command to have Devin escorted back to safe territory.  See, Syrus had been receiving dreams of Devin's recent incident and knows his secret.  He fully believes Devin is the autumstar and fate would have it that god has put him on this planet to make sure he will meet Thron in battle when the time is right.<br/><br/>Devin got his way and lead 20 men into battle, ambushing the Legion forces surrounding the Alliance armor and escorting the vehicles to safety.  As what was left of the Alliance began to re-assemble for an organized retreat, the PC's ended up staying in order to support the resistance left in the city and escort an important Alliance figure to safety whose last known whereabouts where within the walls of Havenstad.  <br/><br/>The final scene of the night was the PC's re-entering a Legion occupied Havenstad and running across a squad of War Devils as they were being ambushed by Civillian Resistance.  They now hope to track down Dr. Fletcher, a civillian scientist important to the Alliance, whose manor is located on the far side of town.  Perhaps with the resistance's help they may accomplish such a goal.  <br/><br/>Note-the current mission to grab Dr. Fletcher and get him out of town is us using the Subterfuge Conquest mechanics.  They're fairly flexible allowing you really to partake in any type of mission to help the war effort.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_233759">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume" title="NomdePlume"><img alt="NomdePlume" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NomdePlume">NomdePlume</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233759/#Comment_233759" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-22T19:34:59+00:00" title="September 22, 2009  7:34PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm enjoying these reports from the front - keep 'em coming <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_233988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/233988/#Comment_233988" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-09-23T19:07:17+00:00" title="September 23, 2009  7:07PM">September 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the reply Darren, it's hard to tell if people read/care about these and if the effort is worth it.

The leader of the cell whose house they were staying at was Brenner, a local civillian who had never wielded a gun prior to Thron's arrival.  They had a quiet night's sleep in the cellar until Devin began muttering in his sleep broken words about the movement of stars and the blade of King Xadian being the key.  Cha-Tac was awake during the whole thing, eyeing the Mage from the corner of the dark, wet, cellar.  Devin's nightmare culminated in a wailing screen which awoke the entire house and caused the single bulb in the basement's overhead lamp to blow out.  He is getting closer to his destiny and all those around him can feel it.<br/><br/>The three departed with Anders - a resistance member who would guide them to sector 12 to locate Dr. Fletcher - and their Alliance Techie Trooper Kessler.  They drove a civillian van through two Legion checkpoints, narrowly avoiding detection with their forged identification cards (Had them make a Fate roll for this).  Kessler in the front seat nearly cracked from the pressure after a woman was gunned down nearby at the checkpoint.  <br/><br/>Once they arrived in Sector 12 they were greeted with a remarkable sight.  This was perhaps the most intact section of the city, children were actually playing on the street and several shops remained open.  Altogether peculiar when put in stark constrast to the rubble littering much of the eastern side of Havenstad.  The group arrived at Dr. Fletcher's manor shortly after, finding him receptive to their mission of extracting him from the city as long as he could bring his daughter as well.  He also made them promise they would return to extract his wife who was being held in a Legion detention facility in the city.<br/><br/>All was going well as Dr. Fletcher and his daughter were packing their things until two armored Legion cars arrived in front of the manor.  Multiple squads of infantry departed and surrounding the doctor's home.  An extended Combat occurred with the PC's holed up inside a house, attempting to blast their way out.  Notable moments of the combat were the liberal use of scattering missed shots and hitting nearby allies due to the close proximity of the fighting.  We also had some nice vehicle ramming as the Anders and Kessler drove their van across the body of a Legion War Devil.  Syrrus also was hit with a Steingratz Firebrand and caught on fire, throwing the embers of his cloak to the corner of the room (Smother action) and screaming: "You shall flee in terror as the battle is ours, for the Autumnstar has arrived in the Riverlands and you will cower before his face!" (This was a banter battle action).  Almost immediately after that Devin unleashed hell yet again as he screamed in agony - flames bursting all around him and engulfing the house and then the entire neighborhood.  Nearly everyone was taken out by miraculous hellfire except for Cha-Tac, who grabbed the PC's and Doctor and threw them into a Legion armored car, narrowly making their escape.  Unfortunately, Sarah - Dr. Fletcher's 9 year old girl - was felled in Devin's Autumnstar-powered-outburst.  <br/><br/>As they gunned the vehicle out of the city a squabble ensued inside the vehicle as Dr. Fletcher was disgusted with them leaving his daughter's body behind to burn.  He drew a gun and put a bullet through Syrrus' collarbone before being disarmed and talked down.  The PC's returned to Lagerstrom with Dr. Fletcher without incident.  Commander Rennix was pleased with their continued success on the front and the group received word of the Alliance conquest of Atropa, as Valien supplemented troops from Mt. Gilead secured the only place on Osaris containing lush plant-life.  The Bruta are certainly enraged and will be launching an invasion in the near future.<br/><br/>We finished up the session with some training, as well as Syrrus meeting with the local Valien Circle led by an Auger - Brother Damian.  Syrrus confessed that he believes Devin to be the Autumnstar - a notion which was been strengthened by not only his own dreams but actual first-hand experiences with Devin the Damned unleashing a small portion of his potential.  Brother Damian and the others ordered Syrrus to bring Devin to meet with the circle and use force if neccessary.<br/><br/>Syrrus acquired a squad of Alliance troops and cut-off Devin as he was leaving Lagerstrom - headed towards Red Canyon to the South.  Syrrus refused to use force when Devin would not commit to meeting with the Valien Circle.  Unfortunately, the circle did not trust Syrrus completely and had gotten to one of the Alliance soldiers.  The Trooper who was loyal to the Valien cause drew his Steingratz Assault Rifle and grabbed a hold of Devin - holding him at gunpoint.  Syrrus dashed with lightning speed and attempted to disarm the poor fellow, only to fail his roll and end up cutting off his entire arm which would cause him to bleed out.<br/><br/>Syrrus convinced Devin to allow him to accompany Devin and Cha-Tac as a compromise to not meeting with the Circle.  Syrrus was persistent as he refused to allow the Autumnstar to wander off virtually alone and Devin could not deny the man.  The final scene was the three of them pulled off to the side of the road for a momentary break and Syrrus questioned why they were headed to Red Canyon.  Devin wryly stated, "But we aren't heading to Red Canyon.  We are heading to [enemy occupied] Stella Dora so that I may locate the grand library and search the Book of Constellations and hopefully get a clue as to what I really am."  <br/><br/>We all collaborated on the idea of the Book of Constellations being an ancient tome of the Valien religion, the copy in Stella Dora being the only available copy besides the original held at Mt. Gilead.  Devin is completely hesitant of traveling to Mt. Gilead at the moment for he fears he will not be able to maintain his autonomy if he appears before the Valien's who prophesized the existence of the Autmnstar years ago.  We also established that despite the tech level, the Valien Council still utilizes written documents.  We all felt this was cool, and I for one have enjoyed adding little tidbits to the established setting.<br/><br/>How a group of an Exodus Tower Mage clad in bright red robes, a Valien Auger in white ornamental gown boasting hundreds of indescribable sigils, and a Bruta Gunknight wearing siege armor and riding a large board are going to sneak into a Legion city and take a stroll through Osaris' largest library is beyond me.  Tune in to find out how.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_235438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb" title="Charlie Gilb"><img alt="Charlie Gilb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.fileden.com/files/2009/1/23/2281732/Acadia%20show.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Charlie%20Gilb">Charlie Gilb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/235438/#Comment_235438" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-03T18:53:02+00:00" title="October  3, 2009  6:53PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is awesome.

When pressed by Syrrus, Devin admitted that they needed help in gaining access to Legion occupied Stella Dora and if they wanted any chance at all they would need the help of Kimo Labs.  Devin had heard the rumors of Kimo Labs having operatives inside the neutral Stella Dora government and saw this as their best shot at gaining access to the city.  Additionally, Kimo Labs would have intelligence which would aid the quest greatly.<br/><br/>[We had a couple of discussions here; we retroactively altered Cha-Tac from a Gunknight to an Alliance Squad leader.  We felt the Gunknight trait was being wasted as many of the missions we were embarking on required some stealth and poise - something Siege armor was not suitd for.  He still kept his Dune Rider trait which allowed him to ride the Duar mount so he still was this obnoxious Bruta Alliance warrior.  So there was now a second car in the convoy holding 5 Alliance Troopers under Cha-Tac's command.]<br/><br/>The group arrived on the outskirts of Red Canyon, halted by a looming chain link fence adorned in barbed wire and a somewhat hulking guard post.  Devin dropped his own name and claimed he wanted to meet with Dr. William Kimo himself.  After some confusion and muffled conversation from the guard booth a call was placed to deeper in the laboratory facility.  This lead to the group being waved through after some minor questions.  <br/><br/>The two cars and Duar mount traveled down a highway road inside the Red Canyon facility for about another mile before meeting with a couple of suits waiting for them in a large SUV-like vehicle who would escort them down a side path.  Splitting from what appeared to be a main road into the facility the group travelled another couple of miles in what the PC's though to be East before arriving at a small rocky outcropping at the base of a hill.  When they halted their vehicles they spotted the large metal door built into the side of the rock, obscurred from aerial vision.  They left the Alliance troopers behind to watch the vehicles and mount and descended into the pit of Kimo Labs.<br/><br/>After taking a dark, winding tunnel they came to a small subway-like train station where they departed on a passenger-less set of passenger cars which would take them several miles down through twisting tunnels till they were thoroughly confused.  Eventually they uneasily departed, passed through a security checkpoint where everyone disarmed but Devin who somehow managed to convince the guards he could not leave his energy gauntlets behind, and ended up in a large conference room, awaiting Dr. Kimo.<br/><br/>The feel of Kimo Labs was sterile, smooth, modern, and creepy.  Surveillance cameras were spotted in most places and surely placed in even those positions which appeared bare.  The group waited in sturdy leather chairs, eyeing the pitcher of water and empty glasses on the table as well as the large bank of monitors on the far wall which were currently turned off.<br/><br/>That's when Dr. Kimo arrived...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jlarke" title="jlarke"><img alt="jlarke" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jlarke">jlarke</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236068/#Comment_236068" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-07T07:50:30+00:00" title="October  7, 2009  7:50AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for these, Agony.

He was frank and cool with the Autumnstar, asking bluntly what he intended to do in Stella Dora and demanding honesty.  Both men lay their cards on the table as Kimo played the recorded video of Devin releasing his first Autumnstar-outburst in Morus Albus (remember this was recorded by J's first character Cedric Vale).  After some tense discussions Kimo relented, agreeing to provide forged documentation and transport into the enemy city.  The group would pose as political representatives from Lathyrus meeting with the Duke of Stella Dora to re-negotiate a trade agreement between the two remnant governments.<br/><br/>Note - in a few minutes of discussion we established that most intact Legion-occupied Cities were functioning under the tyrannical rule of Thron and his minions while still maintaining a facade puppet government.  Thron is allowing the Humans to maintain this government image so as to appease the masses and hopefully more adequately transition the population emotionally to the side of the Legion.  The trade meeting mentioned in the previous paragraph would be a lax and powerless negotiation ultimately dictated by a Legion Vizier who would mediate.  The Vizier would come to the meeting with the documents pre-drafted for the agreement and demand signatures.  <br/><br/>The group slept in the bowels of Kimo Labs, Devin having another unnerving dream sequence which was much more fragmented and blistering than his previous visions.  The meaning was hard to make out and the only emotions which lingered were the feelings of intense pain as well as an image of a trudging through the daylight while looking up at the sky and seeing a dark vast sea full of stars as if night and day had morphed into a single indescribable entity.<br/><br/>Departing Red Canyon in a Legion marked Drop-ship, the group quickly realized one of the two pilots aboard was Field Agent Cedric Vale (J's old Engineer who was left behind in Exodus Tower).  There was some quaint discussion where both parties ended up agitated.  It wasn't long before the group landed atop the Royal docking platform just several blocks from the Duke's courtyard gardens where they were instructed to meet.  The Legion communications station accepted the enemy recognition codes and the group even made it through a security checkpoint unharmed.  There was some funny moments as Cha-Tac attempted to make himself appear more civilized, slicking back his hair and adjusting his grooming standards so he hopefully would not stand out as much.  The group also ended up convincing the Legion guards they did not need an escort to the Duke's gardens and could drive themselves.  This is when they made a B-Line for the Stella Dora library so that Devin could somehow get his hands on the Book of Constellations.  A brief discussion during the ride entailed the sad state of affairs concerning Stella Dora's peaceful surrender to the Legion and seeing the public walking the streets as if their lives had never even paused was both distressing and joyous.<br/><br/>Some system stuff - We've rarely used the full scale Social Combat rules.  I find rolling a whole bunch of times to be draining unless it is a particularly charged situation so we typically utilize a single roll (like convincing the Legion War Devil's to allow the group to drive themselves).  I also rely on Burning Wheel's Let it Ride, so no re-rolls.  Use a Medal if you really want to succeed.  Also, we've had about one large battle per session, the other half of the session consisting of mostly role-play with scattered Challenges (basic skill checks).  The formula seems to work well with our time-frame of a roughly 3 hour session.  Battles seem to be taking about 30 minutes to an hour depending on the number of combatants.<br/><br/>Coming up when I have some more free time...the intense conclusion of the session as the group utilized tooth and claw in an attempt to nab the revered copy of the Valien Book of Constellations.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_236745">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/236745/#Comment_236745" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-09T19:01:26+00:00" title="October  9, 2009  7:01PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The two civillian quad cars arrived at the towering spire known as the Stella Dora library quite rapidly, relying on city plans obtained from Kimo labs.  After flaunting their (illegitimate) political positions and confusing the Legion guards with wit and quick dialogue, they made their way to the lobby where a snotty and elite librarian sit atop a monolithic desk placing quill to paper (a site most Humans would have never seen).  Cha-Tac grabbed the puke by the throat and intimidated the wretch with the aid of Devin as the three PC's and their escort of 5 headed upstairs to the main chamber of the privied scholarly sanctuary.<br/><br/>The main chamber was a magnificent sight with a couple hundred books lining ornate shelves and while many of the group were mesmerized, Devin realized this could not be the entirety of the collection.  The building stretched at least 10 stories higher than the 2nd floor they were on and this collection of books did not compare to the stories he had heard in his travels of the great Stella Dora library.  Additionally, after combing through the selection no one could locate the copy of the Book of Constellations.  <br/><br/>Fortunately, fate was on their side as they discovered a hidden door behind a crank-driven shelf at the rear of the room.  The door was locked but the lock was meant to halt man, not a raging Bruta warrior.  They scurried quickly up a winding stone staircase which arrived at a balcony as all eight let out a collective gasp.  The library consisted of a hollow spire stretching towards the sky, the guts of which consisted of interconnected honeycombing bridges which ended in small chambers housing a thick collection of literature.  Each chamber typically had three entrances leading to stair walk-ways which led to additional chambers forming this massive bridge labrynth.  I will wholeheartedly admit I stole this from the library portrayed in "In The Name Of The Rose" (an excellent Medieval mystery flick).  Fortunately the players had never seen the movie and found the concept exhilarating, taking to the massively complicated hunt for the Book of Constellations immediately.<br/><br/>At this point, Legion War Devils were responding to the break in and a patrol arrived from the stairs below where the Alliance group had entered.  This kicked off a series of battles which would function as a bit of a gauntlet.  The PC's would basically need to defeat their foes then would be allowed a roll to see if the book was located.  After the first battle the roll was an 8 or below.  The second battle would be harder than the first but following victory the PC's would find the Book on a roll of 10 or below and so on as things escalated.<br/><br/>God was on the side of the Autumnstar as he discovered the Book of Constellations within minutes of defeating the first Legion wave.  Escape would not be so easy however, as the final wave swarmed the group, having landed at the top of the library via Dropship and entering the battlefield from two separate flanking positions.  The enemies included a standard squad of infantry with one of the soldiers armed with a Steingratz HMG, an Elite enemy soldier functioning as a Legion Sgt, and an enemy Glyph Devil (Mage) which the group had not yet seen.  <br/><br/>This was perhaps the best battle we've had yet as the limited walk-ways and oddly shaped battlefield played heavily in the strategy of the conflict.  This was also perhaps the toughest opponents the PC's had faced, but since I had yet to gore a single PC after several sessions I felt like laying it on thick and seeing what would happen.<br/><br/>Things looked rather up for the Alliance soldiers initially, despite losing an NPC trooper they dispatched of a couple War Devils and Syrrus hacked the Elite Sgt apart with several wicked slashes of his blades.  Stealth and biding your battle action really hit home during this battle and everyone seemed to fully understand all of the tools at their disposal.  Devin summoned a Vekyri spirit which took out a Legion Trooper before being mowed down by the Legion Machine-gunner.  The Glyph Devil was meanwhile flanking the PC's, looking to cut them off at the exit (they also were unsure just what this enemy was at that point as well).  In attempting to outrun the War Devils they punched through, the group made a critical error as Devin's stealth was blown and he was subsequently cut-down in a hail of Heavy Machine Gun fire, blood gushing from his throat and Cha-Tac grabbing a hold of his writhing body as they fought their way out.<br/><br/>The Glyph Devil hit Cha-Tac with The Sundering but the massive Bruta avoided any damage as he felt his windpipe begin to get crushed.  The group booked it out the front door and fought their way back to their quad cars parked nearby.  Unfortunately, ALL of their NPC Alliance Troopers were left as casualties and Devin began to coat the backseat of the car with crimson.  This is where we ended, the group having seized the book and mid-escape.<br/><br/>FYI - Devin rolled a 19 on the Serious Injury Chart (no way was he going to give up the ghost!) and received -3 to his Fate - ouch.  His Fate is now 3 I believe.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_237356">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/237356/#Comment_237356" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-14T05:59:18+00:00" title="October 14, 2009  5:59AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            From the session on Monday Night (We played without Cha-Tac's player):<br/><br/>Tearing down the streets of Stella Dora, Syrrus attempted to keep pressure on Devin's wound and navigate with a signal deck as Cha-Tac piloted the car with reckless abandon.  Two Legion-police vehicles ended up on their tale but Cha-Tac out-drove them, losing them amid the end of day traffic and nearly crashing his own car in the process.  The Bruta slammed on the breaks in a busy intersection, causing multiple collisions and their own vehicle to be weakly side-swiped.  He tore off the sewer access grate and the trio descended into the depth's to make their way out of the city with their prize in hand.  <br/><br/>A tense game of cat-and-mouse ensued as they evaded a Legion patrol and ultimately exited the sewer system via drain pipe which was emptying into a dried up pond to the South of town.  Kimo labs had provided a hidden car admidst the rock-strewn bed of the pond and they hastily made their escape.  Before they could depart, however, Devin was struck with another vision.<br/><br/>He was standing in the middle of the desert, flat featureless terrain for as far as he could see.  The stars were bright in the sky yet it was daylight (just as he had envisioned earlier).  One of the stars acquired his fixation and slowly began to brighten to the point of intensity.  He began to realize the star was actually an overhead light - the kind you'd see in a Doctor or Dentist's office, and Devin found himself restrained - strapped to a gourney of sorts.  Struggling against the bondage he soon found himself back to reality as Syrrus threw him into the back of the car and they drove off.<br/><br/>They drove all the way back to Lagerstrom with Devin getting a cursory glance at the Book of Constellations during the journey.  We had discussed OOC that the book was scribed on C_ore infused pages which produced a shimmering and mystifying appearance, while also producing the effects of ingesting Dust if one handled the pages long enough.  Who doesn't dig religious hallucinations caused by the very substance the bible is made of?<br/><br/>Before making it all the way back to Lagerstrom the group ran across an Alliance patrol of two dunesleds (half-track like troop carriers which hover).  Cha-Tac attempted to send their recognition codes across the wireless and they were told to halt their vehicle and step out as the two Dunesleds surrounded them - 5 Alliance Troopers exiting from the closest vehicle.  <br/><br/>Anxiety gripped the three as they knew their incident before leaving Lagerstrom would not be quickly forgotten.<br/><br/>[More when I have the time, it seems like we are getting so much done in a 3 hour session compared to other system.  Kind of crazy.]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_239003">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/agony" title="agony"><img alt="agony" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.scottradecenter.com/icons/icon_50_BlueNote.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/agony">agony</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239003/#Comment_239003" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-24T14:29:13+00:00" title="October 24, 2009  2:29PM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sorry for the delay, still going with the last session:<br/><br/>After getting in a quick scuffle with the Alliance troopers surrounding them, they agreed to be escorted back to Lagerstrom and answer for what they had done.  Devin the Damned specifically was forced to bind himself and take a seat in one of the Dunesleds while Cha-Tac and Syrrus drove their vehicle back.<br/><br/>Returning to Lagerstrom they were separated and placed in interrogation rooms where Syrrus in particular was treated rather poorly, getting tossed around by an Alliance Sergeant.  Devin on the other hand faced questions of a religious nature as the interrogator was facing personal problems and wholly believed Devin to the autumnstar.  This was kind of funny as the interrogator was facing an existential crisis and wanted Devin's advice.<br/><br/>Commander Rennix arrived shortly and ordered Devin to be released; Syrrus would stand trial for killing the Alliance Trooper.  Devin pleaded with the General to release Syrrus and pardon him for his crime.  He explained the circumstances surrounding it and we went to Social conflict, using the ladder and all.  Devin won quite handily and despite the fact Commander Rennix would take a hit to his reputation, he would pardon Syrrus.<br/><br/>The group decided to have down-time so Devin could study the scripture and glean some possible information from the text as he still denied the fact that he was what Syrrus believed him to be.  We talked through this as a group and decided he gleaned some information concerning the blade of King's line (Xadian bloodline) would need to be used to thwart Thron.  Syrrus confirmed that Devin had mumbled this in his dreams back in Havenstad when they were in the resistance leader's basement (see earlier post).  The Book of Constellations also foretold of an event concerning "The toppling of a foreign ship, it's charged legacy scattered to the wind."  Not even Devin could realise what was in store.<br/><br/>While all of this was occurring news spread of Alliance victory at both Havenstad and Lathyrus.  Lathyrus in particular was a great news because it would begin to choke the Legion's Dust supply, most of the foul material being refined there.  Sadly enough, they also got news of the terrible death of Balthazaar the Wise - the head Mage of Exodus Tower.  This struck Devin quite hard, for he had studied with the magnificient Bruta Mage on several occassions and fancied him as a mentor of sorts.  The fact that the details surrounding his death were cloudy and possibly even believed to be the result of murder prompted Devin to pack his things and travel immediately to Exodus Tower.  This was cleared with Commander Rennix first, who allowed them to aid in the investigation but made sure Devin was aware they would be reassigned to the front (at Havenstad) in the near future.<br/><br/>When they arrived at Exodus Tower they found it mysteriously deserted.  The front doors were bolted shut but no guards were present.  Devin utilized the massive Bruta warrior Cha-Tac to bash the doors in and entered hastily.  The winding chambers inside mysteriously void.  Typically, scholars could be depicted scattered about the halls, studying the runes.  <br/><br/>Devin hit the man lobby of sorts (used to be the cargo bay on the alien ship but since it is now verticle it forms a huge lobby which stretches up into the sky) and began to ascend the iron stairwells to the top.  He was halted when he heard an eerily familiar voice bellow from up above, telling him to halt.  It was a Mage by the name of Samuel the Ruthless.  Devin had known him briefly and understood that Samuel held a much higher position within the order than himself.  <br/><br/>Samuel spoke quite frankly, letting Devin know the Tower was abandoned due to mourning on behalf of Balthazaar's death.  Samuel was still in the ship because he had assumed the reins in the absence of leadership and someone needed to tend to the structure.  This conversation was a bit tense as Devin could sense something was amiss.  When Samuel explained that they believed Kimo Labs was behind the assassination of Balthazaar Devin gritted his teeth in pent-up rage for he had already harbored ill-will with the organization.  Then it all became clear to Devin the Damned.<br/><br/>Samuel the Ruthless stepped forward out of the darkness, several stories above Devin.  Devin clutched the iron railing in fury as he spotted the Blue sash across the Mage's chest and mask covering his mouth and nose.  Exodus Tower had defected to the Legion in the absence of Balthazaar and not even the Alliance Command was aware of the blatant treachery!<br/><br/>Samuel explained that Thron cannot be defeated and the Alliance, which is fully supporting Kimo Labs, has lost its way.  Devin would have none of this but found himself quickly in danger as Samuel began to warp the metal stairwell around the Autumnstar.  Devin lost his footing, firing a poorly aimed shot at the enemy Mage before stumbling and falling three stories to the ground below.  What happened next is one of those moments which is simply difficult to fathom.  Putting it into words is a chore in of itself but it seemed as Devin's body convulsed upon impacting with the ground, a wave of sound shrieking from his lips as the building began to rumble.  All of the runes of Exodus Tower became alight, bathing the structure in sheer brilliance.  No one heard Samuel wince in pain as the building came down around the two Mages - the onlooking Cha-Tac and Syrrus outside the building gaping in horror as the structure vitually imploded, sending a massive wave of dust across the countryside.<br/><br/>Yes - Devin the Damned, now all but confirmed as the Autumnstar, destroyed Exodus Tower.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_239059">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause" title="Clint Krause"><img alt="Clint Krause" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Clint%20Krause">Clint Krause</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/239059/#Comment_239059" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-10-25T06:45:07+00:00" title="October 25, 2009  6:45AM">October 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Holy crap!

This is all still the same session.<br/><br/>Devin, after reducing Exodus Tower to rubble, swooned in and out of consciousness.  He awoke in a medical ward in Lagerstrom, with people working on him intently.  As men hovered over him in surgical masks and he continued to fade in and out he distinctly got a glimpse of Dr. William Kimo which startled the Mage.  Kimo slowly inserted a needle into the Autumnstar's kneck, injecting him with a mysterious syrum.  Devin fell back into unconsciousness.<br/><br/>When he awoke, he found his comrades surrounding him.  He immediately asked the medical staff if he could talk to Dr. Kimo but they claimed Dr. Kimo was not in Lagerstrom and as far as they know he was performing valuable work in Kimo Labs at Red Canyon.<br/><br/>Before the group could be properly questioned by Alliance authorities, they went AWOL.  Devin had pieced together information from The Book of Constellations and his own visions that he needed the Xadian family blade which King Xadian had wounded Thron with before the fall of Amaranth.  Devin had heard that after Alexander Xadian fell at Amaranth, his fleeing GunKnights had taken his body to Mt. Gilead to be buried.  This is where Devin was hoping to find the Xadian blade and where the group tore off towards, regardless of their Alliance military duties and what had recently happened at Exodus Tower.<br/><br/>When the three arrived at Mt. Gilead, they found a pair of slaughtered Valien guards chained to prominent boulders.  They flesh was flayed and gore painted the terrain.  Cha-Tac immediately recognized the work of the Western Reclamation Zone Bruta and the group was baffled to discover the Bruta had made it this far North and taken Mt. Gilead!  The group fought their way to the top, taking out a Bruta scouting party before heading through a particularly torn up section of countryside (clearly bombared from nearby Alliance Airships which frequent Mt. Gilead).<br/><br/>We cut the session with the group arriving at the top of Mt. Gilead, discovering the peak was still intact and held by the last remaining Valien bastion.  After this session we decided to take a temporary hiatus from EoD and try out some other games.  I promise this game will continue probably around the end of December.  I will update this thread when I have more AP to share.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
