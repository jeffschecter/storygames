Oh, Zolto the Vengeful Archer, will you ever see the light of play?<br/><br/>The thing that hooks me is the way that character motivation is baked right into character gen. Even though these mechanics are really light and non-centralized relative to games like BW, TRoS, TSoY, and LB, I'm cautiously optimistic that their mere presence will encourage groups to develop shared backstory and investment in each other and in the GM's adventures.<br/><br/>Also what WarriorMonk said about the simplicity and usability. It's not just that the rules are easier to implement, it's that they're more closely rooted in the fiction. Bounded accuracy is a great idea.<br/><br/>Matt                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_435559">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435559/#Comment_435559" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T11:31:46+00:00" title="July 21, 2014 11:31AM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm excited to see a version of D&amp;D with simple mechanics that harken back to Basic D&amp;D but with some character mechanics (BIFTs/Inspiration) that feel like Fate or Burning Wheel to me.

So far it seems like they're going in the exact direction I would want them to go.<br/><br/>I also am very impressed by the recent adventures they've put out for 5e--Phandelver is a great entry to the game, and I appreciate the focus on characters, adventure and exploration over encounters and set-pieces. It is the kind of D&amp;D I want to play, which is a varied, consistent and world open for the characters to live in, explore and interact with. And I've got to mention the character summaries and their ties to the town and the adventure, which are really great. I am just impressed overall. They're taking it in a good direction and, if the Starter Set is any indication, gearing towards modules I would actually like to run.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_435590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182" title="phoenix182"><img alt="phoenix182" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nHOMEOBBP484M.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/phoenix182">phoenix182</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/435590/#Comment_435590" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-07-21T21:52:00+00:00" title="July 21, 2014  9:52PM">July 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 21, 2014 9:55PM by phoenix182.">edited July 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1. It's D&amp;D. While that has not always turned out to be true of some editions (to some people), this one at least explicitly makes the attempt. A lot of the core is actually there.<br/><br/>2. Somewhat simplified rule set in many areas, and in areas where it isn't (or doesn't fit your preferences) it seems you can mostly skip it or mod it without significant impact.<br/><br/>3. Setting potential. Even though I'm sure only a couple settings will get the nod, any time we're talking D&amp;D we're flirting with my favorites. The possibility of a revitalized Greyhawk, Oriental Adventures,  Dark Sun, Al'Qadim, Spelljammer, Dragonlance, Lankhmar, Mystara, Birthright, Blackmoor, Ravenloft, Planescape...heck, even Forgotten Realms (though mostly just 1st edition for me). <br/><br/>4. Actively being produced. Since I didn't play 4th and very little 3rd it's been a LONG time since I could engage with others outside my groups about the most important game/hobby in my life. I've NEVER had the chance to go to a con where a version I played was actively supported for instance. Haven't been able to look forward to or buy new material in about 16 years now.<br/><br/><br/>TLDR: I'm excited about the IDEA of D&amp;D 5th edition because of the stated purposes...even if most of the meat of the game is exactly what I don't want and would never play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
