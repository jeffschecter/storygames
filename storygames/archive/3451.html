It was designed to be printed onto a specific type of Avery card which was pre-punched into business cards.  Which probably seems like a good idea until you realise that this stuff isn't available outside of the US.<br/><br/>I bought Grim's school shooting game, whatever that's called ("Final Straw" I think).  It was OK, but the layout of the cards themselves was a bit shit.  The text was too hard to read.  I told him that and he said he'd already made it bigger once to make it more legible.  I suggest that once was not enough.  Also, these came with no backs to print.  That's no problem for me, because I print cards onto paper, then put them in sleeves with old Pokemon cards, so there's no backs anyway.<br/><br/>I also got the Savage Worlds Adventure cards, which were a PDF.  Printed on A4 and came out a bit small, but not small enough to be a problem.  Although, again, I printed them on paper and stuffed them into deck protectors so I have no idea if printing the backs would have lined up with the whole A4/letter difference.  Probably would have been OK, but I don't have any way to print onto cardboard easily so never tried.<br/><br/>8 cards to a page seems to work well.<br/><br/>Getting cards to print right on A4 as well as letter isn't as easy as all that when I tried it.  I mean, you can get by OK, but you might need to make two versions.  Not that that's the end of the world.<br/><br/>Overall though, I've never bought a card game in PDF which was available in print.  Card games have a much more tactile quality to them than RPGs, which are text to be read, understood and referred to during play rather than a thing you actually handle to make the game go (if that makes any sense?).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_77753">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes" title="Rich Stokes"><img alt="Rich Stokes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2ic88ap.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Rich%20Stokes">Rich Stokes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/77753/#Comment_77753" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-26T08:40:08+00:00" title="June 26, 2007  8:40AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's an idea though:<br/><br/>How about an editable PDF of "Blank" cards?
