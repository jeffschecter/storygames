The one person willing to run the D&amp;D game is short on time so typically runs modules or adventure paths for the group. We all know this going in so no one's expecting an open-ended sandbox. But, we had an interesting incident at the last game where the DM kind of tied us to the tracks and ran us over with the train.<br/><br/>What happened was we are starting a delve section of the adventure path (we're about half-way through the AP) and freed a monster that will guide us to the next relevant section of the adventure (ie lead us to the start of that section of the module).<br/><br/>As this beastie is leading us the DM is drawing the few connecting rooms on the dry erase map that get us where we need to go. A few rooms into the journey (all narrative rather than any combat at this point), one of the other players asks a question about the path... and the DM tells us that he's intentionally neglected to draw the other tunnels and side caves along the way so we won't get side tracked.<br/><br/>This is the aforementioned bit where the DM tied us to the tracks and ran us over. The revelation was like a bomb going off at the table. There were other options we could have taken, admittedly they were tangential to the main plot, but the choice was taken away from us. We all knew we were running an adventure path, but we expected to have <i>some</i> choices to make. The DM tried to explain that we had a guide so that would ultimately be the path we would have taken anyway, but the players weren't having it. To my knowledge this is the first time the DM has withheld information and taken options away from the group.<br/><br/>It wasn't that there was a set destination we had to reach (eventually) that mattered to the group, rather it was that along the way we would be given all the information available so that we could actually make some choices ourselves. Even if that information is "irrelevant" to the main thrust of the plot, even if the choices lead to dead ends or "time wasting" side adventures, they're choices the group should be able to make. Or at least have the option of making the decision.<br/><br/>So, DMs, even if you're forced to run a module due to time constraints, at least provide the players with the illusion of choice (if not actual choices to make). Otherwise you might as well simply read them the module and not bother pretending it's a game.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ludo" title="Ludo"><img alt="Ludo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ludo">Ludo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447037/#Comment_447037" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T18:32:31+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  6:32PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2015 6:57PM by Ludo.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hmm, this is interesting.<br/><br/>This is the thought experiment that occurred to me. Let's say that another GM never read this module but happened to design the exact same adventure <i>except</i> that they also didn't offer the side options that your GM "took away." Then you play this GM's adventure. Is it bad because they didn't give you those choices? Or is it their choice to make an adventure where most of the options come through combat or where there are later choices that they deem more important?<br/><br/>It seems like a GM trust issue to me. Whether or not this GM is running a module seems irrelevant, because if they <i>design</i> an adventure that's not giving you interesting choices, something probably needs to change too.<br/><br/>I wonder if you could do some sort of rotating GM duties, where you all design and run one part of the dungeon/adventure. For example, whenever you're in the town it's Paige's turn to GM, whenever you're on the first floor of the dungeon it's Martika, whenever you're on the second floor it's Cory, or whatever. And their characters can be played by someone else or by the person GMing or whatever. That way people can put some work into designing interesting scenarios without being responsible for the whole adventure (since you said no one else is willing to run entire games.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447039">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447039/#Comment_447039" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T18:48:58+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  6:48PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Only the worlds most loaded topic on these boards                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447041">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447041/#Comment_447041" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T18:55:52+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  6:55PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like the GM thought he was doing the group a favor, but in so doing, he violated their expectation that the module would be played as written, and failed to confirm with them that the excised material was, indeed, irrelevant.

The group's objection wasn't that there was/is one "main" story or plot, rather that the DM had removed the possibility of us choosing a few "side" rooms before continuing along the pre-defined "main" story.<br/><br/>I talk with the DM regularly and his intent was to streamline things, though the reveal of the excised options was not well received. If he hadn't mentioned it at all, no one would have known and therefore not have been able to care. Or as mentioned, if he'd have designed it himself with a singular path, no one could really complain of "removed options" as they weren't there in the first place.<br/><br/>But, I think that's essentially beside the point. Even if you only have one singular path though something, you can make it far more interesting by having the illusion of multiple options. As long as everyone knows ahead of time that yes, in fact, there's a specific destination in mind, it's the little side treks that makes the thing more interesting and less obviously a straight line.\n<blockquote>My takeaway from this pre-written module example is: Don't forsake Illusionism for Totalitarianism.

We knew going in that we were on rails, and we were all okay with that, but expected at least a minimum effort at misdirection. The problem popped up because the DM stopped the show, pulled back the curtain, and pointed out that we were on the rails. <br/><br/>This is basically what I'm talking about.<br/><br/><a href="http://i.imgur.com/8mlI9X9.jpg" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/8mlI9X9.jpg</a><br/><br/>In A there are no choices to make, even false ones. This is the worst possible way to do things. It's dull and the DM might as well be reading a novel to the group. There is a single path and the DM will simply keep you on it without any notion that there are other options. Pure railroading.<br/><br/>In B there are no real choices to make, the red paths and rooms are illusions of choice. The DM presents the option to go in any of three directions, but for whatever reason, will keep the players going down the middle path to a predestined room. Whether this illusion of choice is the DM simply saying, no you must go that way or having an NPC guide the players,  putting the players in the "right room" no matter the direction they choose, or having something happen in game that pushes a given agenda, it's still railroading... but at least it's the illusion of choice. Not great, but it makes it easier for the players to accept the railroading that's happening.<br/><br/>In C there are multiple actual choices to make. The players can go anywhere, in any order. The DM simply goes along with whatever the players choose.  Though some stuff is hidden behind secret doors, the characters can find it and interact with that content. They have to be smart or roll well, but they are rewarded with the bonus stuff. Nothing vital to the completion of the "main" story is behind those secret doors. Though it's still a predesigned adventure, the DM does not push, force, cajole, or otherwise have an agenda other than refereeing the game.<br/><br/>Sure, other ways of running games exist, such as Dungeon World and the like which have the DM and players create the adventure as they play, or open sand box style games. But, if you're going to DM a module or adventure path, please at least attempt C. If, for whatever reason, you simply cannot, at least settle on B as the clearly not as good fall back position. If, however, you think A is the best option, stop running games and start writing novels.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/omnifray" title="omnifray"><img alt="omnifray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/omnifray">omnifray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447058/#Comment_447058" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T21:59:46+00:00" title="July 20, 2015  9:59PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If there are no clues as to differences between two routes you could choose between, you have no real choice to make anyway, so the GM is not taking anything away from you by deciding that regardless of whether you go left or right, the door you go through is the one that leads to The Good Stuff.<br/><br/>If you have clues, however, then to my way of thinking the GM should stay true to the implications of your choices, even if you would only have had the barest of hints before making your choice as to its implications.<br/><br/>Let me tell you about a recent GMing experience of mine. My players actually objected to me explaining to them before the game that because a particular player was absent I was going to find a way for their PC to be absent. One of them, the assistant GM in fact, said that he would have been perfectly happy for me to engineer the PC's absence for that reason, provided that I didn't reveal my reasons. He would rather the illusion was maintained.<br/><br/>I get that, in a way, but at the same time it seems to me that it's just obvious that if a player's not there, it's better if their PC is absent, for a whole raft of reasons:- no-one else can do justice to that player's roleplay; next time the player turns up we want the player to have the same knowledge as their PC which is going to be iffy if someone has to explain the missing knowledge to that player - and this is not just about concrete knowledge of definitely clear things stated to the group, but also knowledge or the possibility of knowledge gleaned from the way things happened, from clues and hints, from things that were likely to go unnoticed by some of the players, etc.; bad things may happen to a PC, and it's nice if when a PC is involved in a conflict their player has actual tactical input through the same medium all the time (i.e. presence at the game); even the player's voice and body language etc. conjure up their character for us in a way no-one else can; the player may be more invested in the character for knowing that everything about that character's history in play has come from that player. Seems so obvious to me, that the notion of someone objecting to deliberate exclusion of absent players' PCs is really weird to me.<br/><br/>Players can be wont to discern railroading when none exists. Sometimes one player will be whinging about imagined railroading while at the same time another player feels aggrieved that the game is flooded with too many choices, too much information, too many loose ends. Personally, I think you'll have more fun just concentrating on your character's immediate experience and not worrying too hard about where it comes from. But I may be wrong.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447060/#Comment_447060" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T22:12:03+00:00" title="July 20, 2015 10:12PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2015 10:22PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>it's the little side treks that makes the thing more interesting and less obviously a straight line.</blockquote>If that's your group's preference, then I hear ya, and I agree that the GM should have tried to support it (at least insofar as not acting directly against it).  <br/><br/>I do want to note, though, that not all groups share this preference.

So the GM's job here isn't even "create an illusion for the players" -- it's more "don't get in the way of the illusion the players create for themselves."  <br/><br/>Or am I short-changing the group's ability to agree to a specific destination up front but then totally forget that during play?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jhkim" title="jhkim"><img alt="jhkim" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nCRYQ7RY2P3VV.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jhkim">jhkim</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447061/#Comment_447061" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T22:20:00+00:00" title="July 20, 2015 10:20PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think I'm representative of most players, but I prefer being a little more up-front with railroading. <br/><br/>Mainly, if given the illusion of choice, then there's a good chance that I will try to use those choices to throw the game completely off track - causing a serious conflict.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447062/#Comment_447062" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-20T22:27:41+00:00" title="July 20, 2015 10:27PM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 20, 2015 10:34PM by David_Berg.">edited July 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thinking back on my own "side-track" play, I think it worked when the side-tracks were beneficial but costly.

I feel they are chance to add more detail and richness to the world, and ultimately (to me) the verisimilitude is more important than following precise steps along this plotted line.  <br/><br/>Now, when I roll this incidental stuff, I don't <i>intend</i> for it to be too powerful or overwhelming because my original intention is for the Players to finish the module (in other words, illusionism), but hey - you never know what will happen.  <i>The dice know.</i>  And Players sometimes have genius ideas on connecting up that shit.  Maybe I'll roll that there's a magic mirror in that side passage, and the Players will leave the module!  Dave is right is pointing out that if it <i>is</i> beneficial, there should always be some cost involved.  But that's never hard to come up with.  That's super-easy.<br/><br/>Note however: I am willing to ditch the module if they go outside of it, or to "interrupt" it and then push back into it again later, or else demote it to the level of "research material" while they play around the edges of it.  Most modules include at least a little bit of suggestive material regarding the surrounding region or nearby settlements, and those parts can become source material for local improvisation.  That's an important point (willingness to abort, demote or interrupt the module), and not everyone's cup of meat.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_447074">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447074/#Comment_447074" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-07-21T07:50:36+00:00" title="July 21, 2015  7:50AM">July 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>My takeaway from this pre-written module example is: Don't forsake Illusionism for Totalitarianism.

In D&amp;D-esque play, while there might be one route through the dungeon that leads to the big bad and ultimate plot resolution, traditionally there's been a bunch of side-rooms and extra rooms where, for example, the orcs sleep, or the bugbears go to use the latrine. The expectation is that in a 'dungeon' the PCs can take their own sweet time in making there way to the big bad, so they may as well adopt a 'Turn Left' approach and clear out every room. <br/><br/>It's possibly a disconnect from an old-school expectation that an adventure is a big cave with lots of monsters in it, to a Pathfinder-era expectation that an adventure is a sequence of scenes/encounters that make a story... which we've fitted a cave full of monsters around.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that one solution is to present the side-treks but present them as a genuine choice - maybe their main mission is time-sensitive and you can signpost the dangers in delaying, for example. Of course, if you're running a published adventure, the main mission might not be time-sensitive... and here lies one of the problems of using published adventures.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_447613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/447613/#Comment_447613" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-08-04T19:49:27+00:00" title="August  4, 2015  7:49PM">August 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, "dangers of delaying" is one of my favorite types of costs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
