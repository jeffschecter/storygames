The next scene happens at a different point in time, with no continuity in-between.<br/><br/>Personally, I also like to play games with traditional RPG tropes with hard scene framing like in some story games. However when I do that, some players are shocked as if I'd killed their puppy. They feel player agency is too restricted by moving their characters into a different time &amp; space.<br/><br/>My question specifically: <br/>What are practical ways to deal with this?<br/>How can I create the right expactancy before play?<br/>What concepts should I be clear about (player agency, fictional positioning...)?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479060">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479060/#Comment_479060" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-18T16:46:26+00:00" title="December 18, 2018  4:46PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's how I handle this as GM:<br/><br/>"Alright, we're going to skip ahead now to when you guys arrive in town.  First, is there anything you wanted to get done before then?  Second, feel free to share anything you want to share about how you handle the journey."<br/><br/>Well, okay, I don't literally say those words, but that's the stuff I make sure to cover without actually playing through it.<br/><br/>I find that this maintains the players' sense of continuity, agency, immersion, etc.  As long as they are able to connect the dots between scene 1 and scene 2, they're usually fine.  Just give them that opportunity.<br/><br/>As for how to <i>introduce</i> this approach, I usually say something like, "We only have 3 hours to play, we've got awesome stuff to do in town, let's not spend too much of tonight's session on travel.  We all know it sucks when we <i>just</i> get to town and start doing exciting stuff and then Dan has to go home."  I have <i>never</i> encountered any disagreement with that, at least in principle.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479063">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479063/#Comment_479063" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-18T16:49:03+00:00" title="December 18, 2018  4:49PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To facilitate ongoing communication about such things, you could also use my <a href="http://shrikedesign.com/games/delve/pacing.html" rel="nofollow">Pacing Dial</a>.<br/><br/>If you want to maintain GM control over hard scene framing, though, then this probably isn't what you want.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479064">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479064/#Comment_479064" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-18T16:52:55+00:00" title="December 18, 2018  4:52PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2018 4:56PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree with Dave.<br/><br/>In my experience, all "continuous" trad game-style play also gets "framed". There's not much of a difference. The difference is just that the players make the effort to "connect the dots".<br/><br/>For instance:<br/><br/>Hard framing<br/><br/>"Ok, it's morning! She walks over to you and puts her hand on your leg..."<br/><br/>Traditional framing<br/><br/>"The night passes uneventfully. You toss and turn a little in your sleep, then have the last of your food, cold, as the sun rises. As you're finishing, she walks over to you and puts her hand on your leg..."<br/><br/>The only time there is a more significant difference is if you're interested in skipping more substantial material, like events which actually change plot outcomes. The classic example being, "ok, you're tied to a chair and the enforcer has just stopped beating your face in. She leans in close..."<br/><br/>How did we get here?<br/><br/>That's a more challenging position to put the player in, particularly if trust is lacking or they feel that the game is about "doing well" as the character (in which case getting captured and beaten is a loss, and having that foisted on you isn't fair play).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479068/#Comment_479068" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-18T17:14:48+00:00" title="December 18, 2018  5:14PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2018 5:15PM by BeePeeGee.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like the "connect the dots" approach, David, and also your Pace Dial!<br/><br/>To makes things more difficult, I should mention the following additional restraints:<br/>1.

Or as David suggests, ask people if you can skip ahead and get them to buy in first.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479103/#Comment_479103" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-18T20:23:25+00:00" title="December 18, 2018  8:23PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, I may need to be prepared with some techniques to ease in the immersive players - or just identify them before and say "this is not for you".                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479105">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479105/#Comment_479105" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-18T20:32:56+00:00" title="December 18, 2018  8:32PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 18, 2018 8:39PM by DeReel.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my game I hand the players a remote control, Like David_Berg does.<br/>I was working on this just yesterday.

(There are some secondary "simulationist" reasons as well, but they tend to be very low priority reasons, really more of an afterthought).<br/><br/><br/>Even wargames without GMs, especially those of a minis-using campaign skirmish sort, tend to use an indefinite amount of time between " battles", effectively jumping from one cool clash of arms to the next.<br/><br/>I also know of at least a couple of wargame texts ( and these do tend to be of the Refereed,  Near- or Demi-RPG sort) that suggest when a battle is obviously over for the most part, simply call the game done, wrap things up, and go on to whatever post-battle rules sequence is appropriate.

Another form of scen jumping or cutting, IMO.<br/><br/>The point is, this kind of thing isn't entirely unknown, just maybe not as well known as it could be, which might help even committedly gamist RPGers to relax a bit when those sorts of techniques are used.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479273/#Comment_479273" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-23T09:14:28+00:00" title="December 23, 2018  9:14AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting, didn't think of it from the gamist angle, thanks.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479274">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479274/#Comment_479274" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-23T13:14:18+00:00" title="December 23, 2018  1:14PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gamist: If I can do all of that inside of a ten second combat round, that means I can accomplish [completely absurd shit] in one day!<br/><br/>Simulationist: No. Stop it.

I was thinking in the context of framing scenes for your character that others might appear in, but that if someone else wants to cover something in a period that was skipped over, they can roll back when they frame a scene and then we can move forward again later.<br/>It being a player though also gives you more authority to veto than you would have with a GM, who can theoretically overrule what players say.<br/><br/>I'm also not used to super explicit time-keeping though, and I could see how it could be problematic if a group places a lot of importance on very precise time-keeping and on exclusively playing scenes linearly. Like, in my group's play, we typically cover 2-3 weeks of in-game time in a session (in 1 week blocks), but we're never really explicit when in the week something happens, because with covering a week in just a few hours, we're of course not covering every single thing that occurs; we're just covering important scenes and implying the passage of time without getting into its nitty-gritty.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479288">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479288/#Comment_479288" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-24T00:53:07+00:00" title="December 24, 2018 12:53AM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 24, 2018 1:08AM by komradebob.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I guess I'm a bit lost still, Emma.<br/><br/><br/>If it's my turn to frame a scene for my character, but the way I frame it jumps ahead in time and involves another player's character in some way, isn't there a very real chance that the way I frame things ends up cutting off possibilities of what their character was doing between the previous scene and the present scene?<br/><br/>What I mean is, what if this creates some sort of plot paradox that you can't simply roll back time for that other character's scene easily?<br/><br/>That's kinda what I meant by a player (potentially) taking away another player's agency just as readily as a GM could.<br/><br/><br/>Emma: Okay, new scene: So late in the week, we all meet at the bar on Saturn...<br/><br/>KBob: Woah, hold on, my character was heading off to the Neutral Zone and even at top speed, they'd never be back in time for a meeting on Saturn.

You have to find new ways of getting your ideas in there : having one character tell what happened between the scenes, for instance.<br/><br/>The takeaway for the player is : unless you need to veto a cut, accept to delay satisfaction, get creative.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/hyades" title="hyades"><img alt="hyades" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/458/nC00J8GI62UXP.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/hyades">hyades</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479296/#Comment_479296" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-24T13:14:07+00:00" title="December 24, 2018  1:14PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" rel="nofollow">Paul_T</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>I find quite fascinating the difference between "you get to frame a scene for your character" and "someone else frames a scene for your character". The former is really helpful when you want to advance your character's agenda or portray his/her story in a particular way (as Emma's group needs/wants). The latter is much better when you want to experience the character's story from their perspective, or engage in fictional problem-solving or decision-making.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of games get this distinction wrong in one way or another.</p></div></blockquote>\nI love how the text of Dog Eat Dog absolutely takes for granted that "what would my character do in this situation" is an essential question for scene framing. There, to experience things from my character's perspective and to make decisions as them is to frame scenes as much as it is to actually portray my character. So I wouldn't agree with you on the "much better". Although Sign in Stranger for example has other players "scene frame" for me to great effect as their "framing" is limited to my perception of an alien world with everything else being kind of unregulated.\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/EmmatheExcrucian" rel="nofollow">EmmatheExcrucian</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p><br/>I wonder if there's a different kind of scene framing technique that would help with the agency issues you can easily run into when someone else frames your scene but that retains stuff like experiencing the story from your character's perspective and solving problems and making decisions? <br/></p></div></blockquote>\nDream Askew talks about scenes as emerging from "idle dreaming" to which the group can always return after a scene has ended. I think that's definitely one way to try and avoid agency issues by explicitly offering a non-meta space to get on the same page. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_479298">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479298/#Comment_479298" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-24T17:07:41+00:00" title="December 24, 2018  5:07PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, those are good points and examples, <a href="/forums/profile/hyades">@hyades</a>.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_479386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/479386/#Comment_479386" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-12-30T19:57:41+00:00" title="December 30, 2018  7:57PM">December 2018</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2018 7:58PM by BeePeeGee.">edited December 2018</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I didn't have anything more to add to the current discussion.
