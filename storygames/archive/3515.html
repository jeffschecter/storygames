In that show there is very strong synergy of A-Plot (There's a monster!  Kill it!) and B-Plot (There's a personal crisis!  Brood about it!)  Depending upon how you choose to look at a show, it can either be the show where they fought the body-stealing skin-demon or the show where Angel confronted his loneliness and isolation.  Actually, of course, it's both.  It only becomes one or the other when we abstract things down to <i>one story</i>, because that means accentuating one set of connected ideas and glossing over the unconnected bits.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ... same-same happens in a lot of RPGs.  There's an A-Plot (There's a monster!  Kill it!) and a B-Plot (There's a personal crisis!  Brood about it!)  They're intertwined, and influence each other, but you can still see the outlines of them as separate things.<br/>\n<br/>\nCan the GM determine the A-Plot?  Oh hellz no.  Ain't no way to stop the players from turning it into "There's a monster!  Let's reason with it!" or any other damn thing.  But what the GM can do is to provide <i>ingredients</i> for the group to construct the A-Plot in-game.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you provide people with pasta, vegetables, spices, oil, maybe some wine ... that's a bunch of ingredients that go together.  The folks you provide them to may use all of them, they may use only some.  They may create pasta salad, they may create a three course meal.  You can't really tell.  But you can be pretty sure that they aren't going to make hamburgers ... or that if they <b>do</b> then it's going to be a <i>really funny looking</i> hamburger.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you provide a monster, a dark and spooky mansion, mysterious omens and a whole bunch of downed phone-lines and cell-towers ... that's a certain set of ingredients that go together.  The folks you provide them to may use all of them, they may use only some.  They may create a survival horror, they may create a zom-rom-com, they may create an occult investigation.  You can't really tell.  But you can be pretty sure that they aren't going to make a political intrigue ... or that if they <b>do</b> then it's going to be a <i>really funny looking</i> political intrigue.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo ... you want the controversial bit?  I think that a GM can help make a solid game by providing sets of plot-ingredients that <b><i>strongly constrain</i></b> what the players can make of them.  I think that <i>deliberately ignoring</i> calls for out-of-type ingredients can be a strong technique.<br/>\n<br/>\n"Man," the player says, "If only we could talk to the spirits in this place ... we could do some politicking, make this into a supernatural intrigue..."  Well, <b>tough noogies</b>.  The GM ain't giving you the ingredients for a supernatural intrigue.  There's nothing wrong with pulling in new ingredients, but today that's not what the GM is doing.  Make something from the ingredients that she <b>is</b> giving you.  Get creative.<br/>\n<br/>\nY'know what?  This is walking <i>awfully close</i> to saying "It's totally cool for the GM to determine the plot," and I'm okay with that.  Choosing a set of ingredients isn't the same as cooking it.  Even a very small set of ingredients can inspire people to any number of recipes ... as long as they get to apply their creativity and make important choices about what the story turns out to be, I <i>do not have a problem</i> with telling the players that there are countless stories that they <b>cannot tell</b> this session.<br/>\n<br/>\nHave I finally gone over the edge?  Crossed to the Dark Side?  Or is this just obvious?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79216">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond" title="jake richmond"><img alt="jake richmond" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.atarashigames.com/ghostshark/avtar.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jake%20richmond">jake richmond</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79216/#Comment_79216" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T06:12:07+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  6:12AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Makes sense to me, although that's certainly not the way I'd always choose to go about things.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79219">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79219/#Comment_79219" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T06:24:08+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  6:24AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>I think that<em>deliberately ignoring</em>calls for out-of-type ingredients can be a strong technique.</blockquote>\nIf you're communicating with your players, there won't be any calls for out-of-type ingredients.

In my experience there's constant negotiation going on, but it is very low key and subtle.  You are all working toward the same mood and feel, and things that are jarring tend to get called out and amended.  If everybody is clear on what the group is after, this happens rarely, and eventually not at all.  <br><br>A simple example - last night we played In A Wicked Age, and our situation elements were totally gonzo.  We were all "this is going to be like a Heavy Metal cartoon.  The Immigrant's Song should be set on repeat in the background all night."  So that was a clear expectation and we all tried to honor that.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79231">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg" title="Sydney Freedberg"><img alt="Sydney Freedberg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sydney%20Freedberg">Sydney Freedberg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79231/#Comment_79231" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T07:01:22+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  7:01AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the Key-punch approach is probably the easiest way to get the kind of focus you're talking about: Instead of having the GM try to enforce a certain set of elements and exclude others, give players in-game currency (card draws, action points, XP, whatever) for hitting certain themes.

When that happens, it is very easy (at least for me) to merely <i>react</i> to the players, in a way that doesn't (in turn) provide the players with a strong set of ingredients to build a story.<br/>\n<br/>\nExample:  Last wednesday I set out to provide the ingredients for a Rivalry story.  I presented an obnoxious character (Hiroshi!) who would accept nothing less than total victory, and who had an advantage (she already had an organized team) that you guys could not overcome.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut I was missing an ingredient.  I didn't realize that I needed to deliberately give Hiroshi a vulnerability that you guys could exploit.  I didn't have a scene of her aggressively bullying the reluctant members of her team (to give you guys a chance to talk with those team-members in private, and maybe recruit them away to your (marginally) more friendly group), I didn't have a scene of her being reprimanded by a teacher who was "keeping an eye on her" (so that you could frame her for some sort of trouble-making).  I didn't provide a full set of ingredients, and the result (though gonzo and fun and wonderful) lacked overall structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's not that you guys latched on to some specific structure I didn't intend, and ran with it.  It's that I went half-way to providing a full structure, and then I went into reactive mode, trying to suss out from your activities what sort of extra ingredients you wanted.  The result was that I added a little of this, a little of that ...  Metaphorically I started out giving you pasta and vegetables, then I said "Hrmm ... they look like they want Worchestershire sauce ... and maybe some pickles..." instead of saying "Okay, I'm not going to worry at the moment what they <i>want</i>, what the set of ingredients <i>needs</i> is the oil that will let them saute those veggies, and spritz that pasta."  You guys did the best you could with the ingredients I'd given you, but I'm pretty sure you would have been able to create something <i>better</i> if I'd provided you with a more complete (and restrictive!) set.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy desire to react, to incorporate your ideas and feed them back, <i>overrode</i> my ability to clearly see that I had not finished my own contribution.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79239">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tyler" title="Tyler"><img alt="Tyler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tyler">Tyler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79239/#Comment_79239" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T07:23:33+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  7:23AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The term "deliberately ignore" really strikes me Tony.  I can see having a carrot system of in mood/theme/genre actions and ideas being rewarded, and even the stick of things outside of that being punished inside the story, but the thought of ignoring a players thoughts or flags seems a little antithetical to the whole process, and frustrating to boot.  When does the discussion with your sous chefs begin?  Do they know the ingredients prior to creating or being excited about playing a politico?  Could you give them the ingredients to make pasta salad and cheeseburgers and be content with hamburger helper?  <br>\n<br>\nI guess I'd like to hear what you mean by "ignore", because that seems a rather harsh punishment for not stepping in lockstep with the vision of some soda-chugger running the game.  I see the GM doing alot less dictating and streamlining and a good bit more of weaving and negotiating the ideas and thoughts of the players into an cohesive whole.  The constraints are fine, but I feel there should be a consensus about creating those constraints and if someone is bringing in a spice that may have been outside of those constraints, the value of that should be discussed and not ignored.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79241/#Comment_79241" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T07:25:00+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  7:25AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mark W</cite>I think in practice that its<i>really difficult</i>to meaningfully constrain just on the basis of what pieces you put on the board at the start.

Let me try to phrase it less vaguely.<br><br>If someone contributes something, and it's clearly important to them, the GM shouldn't ignore it completely.  "No, you can't do that ... next!" isn't any way to play with your friends.<br><br>Contrariwise, however, <i>just because someone contributes something</i> doesn't mean that it's important to them.  Making a big deal out of every little twitch or doodle from the players ... it's crazy-making.  If Sydney says " ... and my guy brings a six pack of soda along!" that doesn't mean that I have to wrack my brains trying to figure out how to make that soda vitally important later in the game.  Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.  And if it's more important to Sydney, <i>he has the power</i> to make it important.  It doesn't have to be the GM's job.<br><br>So somewhere between those two extremes there's a balance:  There's stuff that you leave to the players to do (or not do) as they see fit.  Then there's stuff that, when the players put it out there, you need to actively embrace, support and make your own.  Having that balance <i>anywhere</i> other than all the way over at the "embrace" end is going to involve deliberately putting some of the things that the players contribute into the "Not my Job" drawer and getting on with the things that you, as GM, want to do.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79260">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79260/#Comment_79260" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T08:29:06+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  8:29AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TonyLB</cite>How do you mean this?

Heck, I think the game system itself completely controls the plot in "My Life With Master", and that's obviously functional as well.<br/><br/>What's interesting to me is to see the broad range of possibilities available to the group, from the GM retaining complete control of the plot, to placing severe restrictions on it, to putting only a few restrictions on it, to bequeathing complete control to the players.  At every level, I believe one can have successful play; what's not been well described, I think, are the hazards and strengths of the different levels. <br/><br/>So I'm interested to hear what happened when you only gave the group a more limited 'Rival' ingredient list.  What were the hazards, and how did they play out?  What were the strengths, and how did *they* play out?

I don't have a question about being considerate or this being an option, I've continued to come back to the word "ignore" and want to deal with the idea of when these ideas should be introduced or if they should be introduced by the players at all.  I understand when you say "Gosh, I really want to run a good haunted house story!  Who's in?" that that means we as a group are buying in to a the above story.  Is that when I say "You know that would be fun but I'd really dig some nasty halls of power stuff"?  And if I opt to buy in does that mean it is inconsiderate of me to appeal for that element later?  I think in both instances (the politico and the paladin) the parties have the right to say "No", but being able to say "No" isn't the same as ignoring an injected story element for the sake of continuity.  Anyhow, it is a perfectly valid style (being quite the norm from what I've seen), and should derive some good times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79351/#Comment_79351" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T13:13:02+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  1:13PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lpsmith</cite>I'm guessing the former is going to be along the lines of 'unfocused play', and the latter is going to be along the lines of 'unexpected fun', but I'm not sure.</blockquote>Well, I don't have a control case to test against (<i>yet!</i>) so it's hard to know what happened because of the incomplete ingredient-set and what happened despite it.  But, overall, I think you've got the right of it.<br/><br/>I saw something that I haven't seen for ... ahem ... some time:  A player just taking his character straight out of the scene in order to do something totally random somewhere else.  Specifically, when confronted with a contest (in which, as I mentioned, their rival had no vulnerability ... my bad!) Eric had his mad scientist nomma's boy simply flee the scene, and randomly mix chemicals.  He eventually returned, with a vial of Nobody-Knows-What, and the contest continued.  But it was ... odd and unexpected.  Eric sometimes spots these threads ... maybe he'll weigh in on what his experience was.<br/><br/>Interestingly, some of the unexpected fun resulted directly from this:  When confronted with a werewolf, Eric's character quaffed the gunk, which had a Jekyll and Hyde effect on him.  He hulked out, basically ... and one of the other players promptly directed their now-raging comrade in the right direction:  "That big furball just insulted your mom!"  It was quite funny to watch Eric, affecting a hunch and a monstrous snarl, growl out "Not MOMMA!  AIDAN LOVE MOMMA!" and leap to the attack.<br/><br/>But like I said, I don't have a control.  Could I have gotten the unexpected fun <i>in the context</i> of a clear structure that could help people moving forward and feeling engaged?  Would Eric have said "Ah!  I know!  We need CHEMICALS!" out of engagement rather than (as I strongly intuit) boredom and desperation?  Dunno.  Dunno.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_79396">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris" title="Andrew Morris"><img alt="Andrew Morris" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.plaguemonkey.com/sgicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andrew%20Morris">Andrew Morris</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79396/#Comment_79396" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-03T16:31:12+00:00" title="July  3, 2007  4:31PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tony, what's your topic?

I'm talking about (and if I'm not mistaken <i>we</i> did this, you and me, at a convention) when we're playing through a town, and you say "I am totally convinced that there has to be some demonic possession goin' on here!  I'm'a gonna go find it!" and I, as the GM, say "Be convinced all you want, but you're wrong.  No possession.  No magic.  Just three messed up kids whose lives and town have been torn apart by their sins.  Sorcery isn't what we're doing today, no matter how hard you look."<br/><br/>But what if you're really psyched to get into the metaphysics of Dogs, etc., and fight some demons.  I don't care.  I ignore that.  Ain't your job to decide what makes up the town any more than its my job to decide how you judge it.  We do not have to do everything by consensus:  sometimes we delegate, and that works fine too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79527">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB" title="TonyLB"><img alt="TonyLB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TonyLB">TonyLB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79527/#Comment_79527" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-04T19:16:40+00:00" title="July  4, 2007  7:16PM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Tyler</cite>I've asked a couple times about two aspects of the style you're talking about.

Guess I've got a vote for "You've turned to the Dark Side."<br/><br/>Providing the ingredients isn't the same as telling the story all on my lonesome.  It's constraining <i>what type of story can be told</i>, but then leaving it to the players to tell it within those constraints.

I see it as a <i>different</i> status, with different authority.<br/><br/>Is authority over the structure of the story "above and beyond" authority over the protagonists and their choices?  I'm skeptical.  I think that's a value judgment about what is important in a game, and not one that's universal.  Yes, if you (the player) don't give a fig about the protagonists and their choices, you only care about the structure of the story as a whole, then a GM role that gets those decisions delegated to it is a special and superior position.  But me, personally, I'm okay with <i>my part</i> of telling the story to be deciding what to do with a limited set of ingredients, and I don't see that as an "inferior" position to that of the person who chose the ingredients for me to work with.

Only having read the thread on character gen for MB, I'm not familiar with the ramifications of acting outside the confines of the "Social" and "Quest" cards, but I'm guessing there is a carrot and stick to it.  I would ask when and if those players get to reintroduce that "Rivalry" card they're hankering for, but it may not be an appropriate track for this thread.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I can see that, but I think that it is a line that can be systematically drawn.

I think it makes more sense now.  In a game where these roles and distinctions are well defined, I think this GM style, but in a system where they aren't, the players better hope for some benevolence.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">Is authority over the structure of the story "above and beyond" authority over the protagonists and their choices? I'm skeptical. I think that's a value judgment about what is important in a game, and not one that's universal. Yes, if you (the player) don't give a fig about the protagonists and their choices, you only care about the structure of the story as a whole, then a GM role that gets those decisions delegated to it is a special and superior position. But me, personally, I'm okay with my part of telling the story to be deciding what to do with a limited set of ingredients, and I don't see that as an "inferior" position to that of the person who chose the ingredients for me to work with. Cooking is fun, food-shopping less so.</div>\n</blockquote>\n<br/>\nI think it has to do with the amount of entry points into the story that the GM role has that makes it "above and beyond".  The DM can interact with the world through protagonists, antagonists, time, space, global events, and the presence of things.  The player has one entry point, so logically they better make that entry point as dynamic as possible to give themselves greater flexibility.  I don't think we're getting great stories out of this form, I think we're just getting an escalation of power.  Now this is a gross generalization, but I think the thought process holds true for the two games out there with the largest pieces of the market share pie.  I will say that it seems that MB seems to give a good deal of bonus to acting within archetype and so it may benefit greatly from the structure.  I do believe they should have a little more responsibility to the story than just to deal with their protagonists, and I think that many players have a desire to fuel the story, creating the conflicts that get them excited and the relationships they can really sink their teeth into.  I think some people really enjoy picking out the ingredients (Bill Parcels comes to mind), and it may not work well for that player to not be able to add paprika.  And also think you're ignoring the point that the GM more often than not does much more than pick out the ingredients, he's also getting his hands dirty in the kitchen as well.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will ask, is this a design thought (this role is great for X game) or is this a general idea for when one sits down at the table?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_79599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/79599/#Comment_79599" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-07-05T08:33:08+00:00" title="July  5, 2007  8:33AM">July 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see why this is controversial.
