This means that, in any discussion about the future of indie game publishing, people push for different kinds of "solutions" based on where they are coming from.<br/><br/>Now, this isn't meant to be comprehensive or used to categorize players or playgroups.  This is meant to show the diversity.  Most people and playgroups exhibit a variety of consumption styles with different games.  For example, I imagine that many groups spend most of their time playing one game, <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> or <i>Cyberpunk</i> or <i>Earthdawn</i> or what have you, and generally use contemporary indie games as one-shot filler when someone doesn't show or they need a break, in the same way games like <i>Og</i> and <i>Toon</i> were used in the past.  Whereas, in groups that focus on indie games, playing an arc of D&amp;D may not be treated any differently than playing a season of PTA.<br/><br/>This list of 6 examples is written using television and movies as a metaphor, but that's just for accessibility.  Anyway, here goes...<br/><br/><b>1. Going to the Movies Alone</b> is kinda like buying books just to read them, sharing much of the same social stigma even though there's not really anything "wrong" with it.  This is just not the intended social activity that you're supposed to do with the games, but publishers appreciate your business even though they'd rather you do it with your friends because A) you might enjoy it more and <img alt="B)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/sunglasses.png" title="B)"/> it would draw an even larger crowd.  If you're buying games to read them, then new games are great as long as it's possible to navigate through them to find what you want and as long as you're not worried about keeping current on everything.  If you are struggling to stay up to date on all the new games and developments... you're pretty much screwed.<br/><br/><b>2. Buying DVDs</b> is like playing a lot of one-shots.  After all, you might watch a movie you own every now and then, pulling it out when you haven't seen it in a while, but you're not going to watch the same movie every week.  Similarly, at Story Games Boston, we generally play different things every week.  While there are some games we play more regularly, like PTA, we depend on new material to keep things interesting and exciting.  If people stopped bringing new games to try out, we would have to change the way we operate.  For us, it's not a problem that there are more indie games than we could ever play.  That just means there's more selection.  You never walk into a video store and say "I wish they had fewer movies available," do you?  The most important thing is variety, having a lot of games that are really different from each other in the play experiences they offer, rather than being slightly different versions of games we've already played.  Why watch a highly derivative movie if the original is better?<br/><br/><b>3. Watching Mini-Series</b> is the best equivilent I can think of for playing a lot of short arcs, 3-8 sessions of a game with a conclusion or endgame that brings everything to a close.  This is stretching the metaphor a bit, since there aren't that many mini-series on TV, but what can you do?  Since things aren't open-ended, you still move through different game systems at a fair clip, but not as fast as people who play mostly one-shots.  If new games look really interesting, you might give them a go, but you might be less inclined to try out something that looks really flashy just for the hell of it.<br/><br/><b>4. Casual TV Series Watching</b> is like playing in a relatively fluid group, where you play once a week (or less), whenever the game group decides to get together (the equivilent of "whenever you catch the show on TV"), but you stop playing if it stops being fun and maybe pick up something else that looks more interesting.  Generally things are open-ended, though, so you can keep playing the same game as long as it's going well and people show up.  Since you're moving through products here much slower than people who play mostly one-shots or short arcs, it's not as important for you to have a ton of games in the queue.  This sounds more like the style of play that Christopher is espousing in his thread (though I won't claim to know how he plays or consumes games), where a few solid games could keep you happy for a long time.<br/><br/><b>5. Hardcore TV Series Watching</b>, where people watch every episode religiously, have the t-shirts and the backcatalogue on DVD, is like people who mostly play and consume a single game system or product line.  Maybe it's because other games don't really interest them.  Maybe it's because they've decided they're a hardcore fan of one particular game, because it really speaks to their needs.  I think the Burning Wheel and Riddle of Steel often seem to have people who follow this consumption style more than other indie games, though other games certainly have a few.  For these folks, new indie games matter less than supplementary material or new info about the game they love, even if it's free info published on a website or fan-created material or getting to play with the designer at a convention.<br/><br/><b>6. A TV/Movie Buff</b> loves the medium in general and thus revels in anything good (for a very subjective definition of "good") that comes out of it.  They consume everything they can get their hands on, based on the limits of their disposable income and personal priorities.  Perhaps they have specialized tastes in a specific kind of thing.  Perhaps they're mainly interested in groundbreaking developments.  Perhaps they follow a handful of specific designers whose work they really enjoy.  I imagine more than a few people on Story Games fall into this consumption style fairly regularly, even though they probably exhibit other play styles in their home groups.  This kind of behavior is especially prevalent on the internet and at conventions, I suspect.  When you're in this mode, new games are always cool, as long as they catch your eye.<br/><br/>Anyway, just some stuff I've been mulling over.  Like I said before, this is just a sketch of the kinds of issues that may come up for people when they think about the recent explosion of indie game publishing and game consumption.  I'm sure individuals all have much more specific and diverse consumption styles that don't easily fit into categories.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127553">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127553/#Comment_127553" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T07:50:36+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  7:50AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><b>5.

It's interesting to see how some kinds of TV shows lend themselves more to one style or the other, but others have a very broad appeal, or rely on making casual watchers into hardcore watchers. Soap operas, for instance.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack" title="Ron Hammack"><img alt="Ron Hammack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ron%20Hammack">Ron Hammack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127560/#Comment_127560" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T08:03:45+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  8:03AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Stoughton</cite><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite><b>5.

TV metaphors aside, even on RPGNet we see people rub each other wrong all the time: While we are all, y'know, into gaming enough that we're here online talking about it (which makes us all enthusiasts at some level), after that there's lots of reasons why we engage in the spending habits, buying habits, discussion habits that we do.<br/><br/>Recognizing them, and making an attempt to categorize them (especially in a way that doesn't show "This way Bad, That way Good"), is a good way to clearly see them. So that we can understand why Person A doesn't go into games the way that we do, and yet still find common ground to discuss games, gaming, and so on.<br/><br/>I can't properly express my enthusiasm at the idea behind this post, so instead here's a brief clip from the movie KRULL:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://story-games.com/goodies/meme/krull.gif"/><br/><br/>Personally, I'm a "Buff", who spends most of his "enjoy time" "watching miniseries".

System does matter, but it is far from being the only thing that does.</blockquote>\nThis is an important point.  Playing a one-shot of <i>Primetime Adventures</i> vs. a short season vs. a long season vs. an ongoing TV series with multiple seasons is very different.  The approach one takes to a game can sometimes be wholly independent of the game system or the intentions of the game designer.  I've played one-shots of <i>The Shadow of Yesterday</i> and <i>In a Wicked Age</i> even though their systems are clearly intended for multiple-session play.  So consumption habits don't necessarily vary between game systems, even when the games themselves may try to suggest certain consumption habits.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_127584">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Anemone" title="Anemone"><img alt="Anemone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.tlucretius.net/temp/anemone_icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Anemone">Anemone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127584/#Comment_127584" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T09:03:34+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  9:03AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Put me down on the list of Buffs who like a bit of everything.

I gave up cable several years ago, so I don't watch a series on a week-by-week basis, I wait until a season comes out on DVD and watch it all at once. Some shows I'll only watch once that way, while others I keep coming back to -- I can easily see myself watching <i>Buffy</i> from start to finish once every year or two forever.<br/><br/>My ideal game consumption pattern would be much the same -- I don't want One True Game that I'll play exclusive of all others until I die. What I do want is a game that make me want to <i>play the hell out of it</i> for two months, six months, a year, then move on to the next game, which I also play the hell out of.

Life is too short to spend playing the same thing.  There's more than one good TV show on, and they tend to end after 5 or 6 years (or sooner for too many good ones).

When you know you're running a mini-series or a movie trilogy, you can really amp things up as far as meaningful character death, driving directly into the conflict and stuff like that.  I find the multi-year tv series model gives too much investment into individual characters.  When they die, it never does quite feel like the death does the character justice.  Or you risk pissing off the "fan" of that one character.<br/><br/>I once ran a three session run of a sci-fi game with an early version of FATE and told one of the players that by the end of the third session, their character would die.  He took it on himself to overload and explode a space station which was a beacon for an invasion force traveling across the emptiness between two galactic arms, effectively trapping them in hyperspace.  He then took over an NPC and the rest of the group went on to expose and/or destroy the remaining collaborators of the unknown alien force coming to take the selection of the galactic arm surrounding Earth.<br/><br/>A 3 session "trilogy" was perfect for what we were trying to accomplish.  The player above even volunteered the piece of information "but in order to destroy it, someone has to stay and override the various safety measures as they kick in."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_127849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/127849/#Comment_127849" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-19T19:30:43+00:00" title="February 19, 2008  7:30PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So have you ever seen the cartoon "Home Movies" with Brendan Small and his buddies? <br/><br/>Yea, that's my model.
