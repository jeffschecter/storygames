The main reason I've stuck with Lulu instead of diversifying is that so, so many of the POD shops never once responded to my emails.  Lulu by contrast, I can start to finish set up my print job using web tools, and their customer service is always around and highly responsive.  <br/><br/>Right now the main downside is that they can't do mixed black and white/color projects like, say, Perfect or Mortal Coil, affordably.  If it's got any color in it, it's an every-page-is-color book, and that adds up way too fast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61294">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61294/#Comment_61294" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T08:27:22+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  8:27AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh, that's funny. I just read the thread on Collective Endeavours, as well as this one, and my experiences are noticably different. <br/>\n<br/>\nOur first print run (Jul '05) was with RapidPOD. Excellent turnaround, excellent responsiveness during the printing process--up until the part where they said "ok, they should hit the presses middle-end of next week". And then nothing. And then more nothing. No confirmation that they had actually been printed, or communication about how we were going to physically get the books, or anything.  The books, luckily, showed up at GenCon, but in a mismarked box so it took us half a day to find them. In fairness, that was the time when 2 out of 3 employees who could run the binding equipment were hospitalized for a couple weeks, right before GenCon, and RapidPOD had run a big special to drum up business, promising all the books for GenCon. And, like i said, while we got nervous, nothing actually went wrong in our case. Though we never got a proof, nor did they ever suggest such a thing. So I'm glad my PDF-production skills, and/or their printing skills meant there weren't any major hitches.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe printing itself was reasonably good quality. For those who haven't seen it, much of the art in Dread is photographs, often very dark photos, and these are notoriously difficult to print properly, period, much less without a proof, and on a laserprinter rather than a web press. So, the first print run came out a bit dark and murky. But, other than them not sending us a proof, that's really not their fault. My first time trying to print any sort of photo, so i had them too dark. And they got the color for the bloody handprint on the cover perfect, as well as the ghostly windmill on the back cover--not too dark, not too light.<br/>\n<br/>\nHowever, physical quality of the books was horrible. Very few of them were trimmed completely square (most often the top edge was noticably slanted). Many of them were bound skewed. Some had glue dribbling out the ends of the spine. Some had wrinkled spines. Many had the pages noticably skewed relative to the spine, and those that weren't skewed usually had the fronts and backs vertically offset by a significant amount (like, 1/4")--something that's very noticable with Dread, because it has a running footer for the entirety of the book. Trimming was very hit-and-miss, with some books being trimmed badly enough to loose text--which highlighted the poor job aligning the textblock when printing and/or binding, because when that does occur, it should trim all pages equally badly, but instead it would get progressively worse towards the back of the book. We reported the copies that we deemed unsaleable, and they sent us more, for no additional charges, not even shipping, to make up for them. And without asking to see the defective copies, even. But, to be clear, we had to *search* to find 5 square, aligned, etc., copies four ourselves, out of a 70-copy run--the rest may have been saleable, but they were noticably physically defective.<br/>\n<br/>\nOur second print run was with RapidPOD, too. I adjusted the photos and gave them a new PDF, and that solved that problem. But, despite using the exact same source files for the covers, this time the windmill on the back cover pretty much disappeared, it was so light. And the physical quality of the books was even poorer. We ended up pulling at least 10% of the books as not being acceptable quality to sell, and, again, the rest were generally poor quality. At the time, we didn't even bother contacting RapidPOD--between our experiences, and others, we simply decided to give up, call it a loss, and use them as convention prizes and the like.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61295/#Comment_61295" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T08:27:48+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  8:27AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFor our third print run, we went with RPI. Good experience. We got rapid turnaround within deadline, professional responsive  communication, a proof FedExed to us overnight, and corrections made as needed. Mostly (see below). Visually, the books turned out awesome, with one caveat. First, the caveat: for some reason, the covers ended up with a distinctive cyan or greenish tint to them, though it's only noticable in the ghostly windmill on the back cover. Neither I nor they could figure out why--they swore they hadn't messed with the files, just printed them as-is, and i confirmed that the source files (the same one i'd used for previous printruns) was (1) CMYK and (2) the particular embedded image was CMYK, converted from a grayscale scan. I made them aware of it when i saw the proof, and while a couple other minor issues were fixed, that one wasn't. Mind you, i suspect it's subtle enough that most won't notice, but i'm picky. Other than that, things were pretty much perfect. The books are gorgeous, and the trimming and vertical alignment--both of which are pretty demanding, with tight margins, for Dread, were excellent. All the books were square, and the same size, and the text blocks were aligned from front to back of the page.<br/>\n<br/>\nThen the wierdness started. I'd sent them, i thought, all the info they needed to charge the business credit card as soon as they said they were printed--even before i'd actually received the books. About a month after GenCon, they contacted me to say they needed the CC info, so they could charge us. I gave it to them again. A couple days later, the rep contacted me to say that he needed to fax me and have signed a physical form, for CC transactions--why he didn't know that prior to then, i don't know, though he implied it was a new policy of AlphaGraphics, because this was right about the time they took over from RPI. OK, i figured it was just chaos during the transition. Sent it in, and so on. Six weeks or so after *that*, I got an invoice in the mail, though i had to call them to make sure it was a bill, not a receipt, because it wasn't clear (or i'm just not used to dealing with whatever the standard format is in the printing world). They tried and failed to fax me another CC signature form [the failure was most likely on my end, so no blame there], so I promptly mailed them a check, which got there before they could get around to bugging me again. Now, in fairness, i suspect the billing issues were at least in part due to the transition, and they never charged me any interest or late fees or anything, so it was mostly just a bit frustrating, trying to reconcile my bank account.<br/>\n<br/>\nFourth print run was with AlphaGraphics. That would be just last month--after Joshua had all his problems, and Brennan warned me not to use them. Best experience so far, and best quality books, so far. They were able to handle a tight turnaround, brought on entirely by me not getting my act in gear as quickly as I should have. I got a proof, and all the corrections that needed to be made were made. And that included switching presses, due to trimming/size issues, at no upcharge to us (mind you, expecting a 5.5"x8.5" book to be 5.5"x8.5", not 5.4"x8.3", doesn't seem at all unreasonable, so i would've bitched if they'd tried to charge us more than quoted for that reason, even though i understand the manufacturing processes that led to it). Not only is the gray image on the back cover free of color cast, but that's despite me asking them to adjust the color of the handprint, which they did. [And which i shouldn't've asked them to do--it turns out that the original color was a perfect match for previous printruns, it just looked odd to me because it was matte finish instead of glossy. Now it's a bit too red. But that's my fault, not theirs.] The whole billing/shipping thing went off without a hitch, including a 3-way split shipment, with the only delay being me taking a week to get payment to them. And my rep was easy to get a hold of, and returned my calls/emails in a timely manner--more timely than i did, generally. He also was the most knowledgeable-seeming print rep i'd dealt with at any of the 3 companies, and was quick to consult one of the actual printers and get back to me with an explanation when i asked him something he didn't know the answer to. Prices were reasonable--higher than RapidPOD's, but not by much. Heck, RapidPOD's prices have roughly doubled since our first print run, too. And cheaper than several other places i got quotes from. I would use AlphaGraphics again. I wish i knew whether the differences between my and others' experiences with AlphaGraphics represented an upward trend in quality/communication, or too much variability.<br/>\n<br/>\nOh, and with RPI, we didn't have a single poor-quality copy, and, so far, no signs of any with AlphaGraphics (since about half the books shipped directly to someone else, and i've never seen them, i can't say for certain).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61296">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/woodelf" title="woodelf"><img alt="woodelf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/woodelf">woodelf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61296/#Comment_61296" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T08:29:03+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  8:29AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (continued)<br/>\n<br/>\nFurther comments, beyond our own printing experiences:<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking at Best Friends, it *does* look like RapidPOD's quality control has improved immensely. Though that's not much of a test--very little in the way of shades of gray, fairly generous margins, easy-to-read typfaces. Then again, it was never the actual print quality that we had a problem with, and problems of the scale we had would definitely have shown up, if they were endemic. We may try them again. The biggest feature about RPI that i liked was the affordability of semi-randomly interspersing color plates, as in Mortal coil, which i'm hoping to do for our next game. I gotta find someone who'll do that for roughly the price of the appropriate printing (i.e., 190pp B&amp;W + 10pp color, as opposed to having to pay full-color price for the whole book, when it only has 1-in-20 pages full-color).<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for Avalon: before going with AlphaGraphics for this latest print run, I tried to get a quote from Avalon. Two months later, I have yet to get a response (and, yes, i've checked my spam folders).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61297">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick" title="Troy_Costisick"><img alt="Troy_Costisick" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://thumbs.webs.com/s/viewProfilePic/?siteId=67823825&amp;memberId=67823877&amp;size=small&amp;530737"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Troy_Costisick">Troy_Costisick</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61297/#Comment_61297" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-16T08:31:57+00:00" title="March 16, 2007  8:31AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RapidPOD is very erratic.
