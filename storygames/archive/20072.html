I wrote a post about that for <a href="http://www.runasexplosivas.com/2015/03/reflexiones-sobre-una-sesion-de.html" rel="nofollow">my blog</a>, but I leave here a translation. Some questions related to the post: what is it that enhances on hinders our "immersion" when we play? In which sense do players and GMs play differently? Could we give the GM an experience similar to that of being a player?</b><br/><br/>I have to say first that, since I got started with indie or weird games, I've been a player really few times (except when playing GM-less games), to know how does it feel like to be "on the other side of the screen". What I'm about to tell would be my first intense experience running a PC, probably I've achieved the fabled "immersion".<br/><br/>My PC is an infernal: he gets his power from dark entities, in exchange of being in their service. I was instantly attracted to this skin, as I found it the darkest of them, and I wanted to run my character as a dark guy. Not only that, but have my PC be a violent person, quite the opposite of how I am.<br/><br/>Omar is a sort of popular guy in the school (football player, goes to parties, etc.), who got this after committing suicide and making a deal with a demon. He's impulsive and ambitious, and also pretty violent and dominating, but sometimes he also feels quite guilty and wants to bow out. At first (first session), it was a little hard to run this character, have him fight with other for status, seduce other guys just to see how can he manipulate them. Even then, I felt some real connection with him.<br/><br/>The more intense stuff came with the second session, that started with my character getting into his darkest self. Infernal's DS is terrible, the character has to do things for his dark power in order to gradually lower his power (strings) over him, to eventually gain back his freedom. The thing is, I consciously turned my PC into a monster during that session: I seduced a guy who constantly suffered bullying, then I took him to the forest and sacrificed him to a demon; I betrayed another good guy, almost a friend, to the same demon to be corrupted and possessed; I set a church on fire (perhaps this was the least terrible thing :P). And all that felt REALLY personal; I mean, I knew he was getting into truly deep shit, but there was still no disconnection from the character; Quite the opposite, I felt "near him", to the extent that having him do those things was a little uncomfortable for me (for context, I usually can't have my characters in videogames do immoral things, 'cause it makes me feel guilty).<br/><br/>Motivated by this, first, some thoughts about "<b>immersion</b>":<br/><br/>I felt this as a strong connection with the character: I wouldn't usually hesitate about what to have him do or say next, and I kept putting him at risk, doing things at every moment (a player told me she felt he was in a constant hurry, always using all the resources at its disposition to get what he, or the demon, wanted). I rolled the dice LOTS of times, but without worrying about passing or failing, in fact I also failed lots of times. For example, I rolled stats at -1 o 0 (even -2) without hesitation; when I GM, most of my players tend to avoid rolling those stats, as they'd rather maneuver into a position where they can roll their highest ones.<br/><br/>The first thing I discovered is that I could get a strong connection with my character, and at the same time play it "to lose", or at least have him act wrong, both strategically and morally. I feel it is not necessary for immersion to have the character be a copy of yourself and run him only to win.<br/><br/>The second thing I discovered is that that connection wasn't weakened by the "darkest self" rule, in fact it strengthened during the second session. Most here must have read Monsterhearts: during your "darkest self", the game tells you how you should run your character (pretty loose instructions, still). We're talking about a severe transgression to the sacred player freedom, and yet (in my case, at least), there was still a connection. Perhaps I'm beating a dead horse here, but this experience confirms for me Vincent Baker's <a href="http://lumpley.com/index.php/anyway/thread/22" rel="nofollow">redefinition of immersion </a>back in 2005.<br/><br/>(I put the second part of the post in other.. post, 'cause the forum tells me otherwise it's too long)<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443663">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443663/#Comment_443663" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T15:11:40+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  3:11PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>(second part of the post)</b><br/><br/>But more important, this session got me thinking about <b>the differences between being a GM, and being a player</b>:<br/><br/>A feature of being a player, or at least a possibility, is to "play passionately": to strongly identify with a character, and put that passion into play. You play for yourself, for your character, not so much for the group. Your actions and choices stem from the inside, from what you feel your character is going through (though you should at some point explain that to the others).<br/><br/>The first thing I asked myself after that monday was, why can't I put that same "passion" or identification when I GM, but applied to my npcs?. But then, I think the  distinctive feature of being a GM is to stimulate and provoke players to help them reach that "passionate play". The GM doesn't normally play for himself, he does it for the group, to set a stage for them where they can play. Of all the players, he is the one from whom we demand the most in terms of explanations: he should be impartial to us, he shouldn't play to win, etc. Keep in mind I'm mostly talking about story-now games, not all rpgs.<br/><br/>But all that said, I believe this roles' distribution might start to change. I've always noticed that players are generally the ones who most easily run antagonists, as they can be as aggressive and passionate as they want, without pulling punches due to a fear of being unfair, partial, of abusing their power, etc. The design issue to address here would be: is there any way to design a game that could lead the GM to play like a player does?<br/><br/>I have the first tip of an answer: let's say the GM can run his most important npcs, those with an agenda and drive, at least, as if they were their pcs: think of them as their own, not only as opposition of someone else, identify with them ("identify" as I use it in this post, not as blindly defend them), have them act as they should, not only as would be best for the story of the main characters. That is, to make the relationship PCs-NPCs different from its traditional setup (protagonist-antagonist): it shouldn't be an issue if an npc suddenly falls in love with a pc and starts to help him, for example. But if the opposite happens, if an important npc acts against them, he should run her at its fullest, no brakes, no guilt.<br/><br/>I see some <b>issues </b>this hypothetical gaming style could bring up, or at least things that should be addressed in a system:<br/><br/>-To fully free the GM from his duties as an arbiter and let him oppose the players with no guilt (when so he desires), the rules that work as a frame for that opposition should be as clear as possible. Otherwise, we put again the GM in the role of being the opposition AND the arbiter at the same time.<br/><br/>-If we let the GM choose if and when he wants to be opposition, or not, according to what he feels their characters should do ("to play inwards"), the game could suffer, sometimes, from not having any player running an opposition for the characters. I don't have an answer for this, yet, but I feel it can be used in a way it doesn't mean dull play.<br/><br/>Okay, this session led me to think about lots of things. I'm working on a short game I'd like to show you something of in some weeks, because it is related to this new or different (as I see it) way of being a GM. I'd like to ask to you, do you feel the need to change the way the GM actually plays, in most games? Do you imagine any other difficulties in this hypothetical gaming style? Are there any games that already deal with this? I'm aware of many games where the GM runs the opposition and the rules present clear guidelines of what he can and can't do: Burning Empires, 44 A Game of Automatic Fear, S/lay w/me perhaps? But I feel there's something else that can be done here.\ufeff                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_443678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443678/#Comment_443678" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-04T18:10:48+00:00" title="March  4, 2015  6:10PM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think that any game which includes a single, recognizable GM role will inherently saddle that GM with responsibilities beyond "just play your NPCs".  If this isn't a GM-less game -- that is, if everyone <i>else</i> gets to <i>not</i> be GM (perhaps to better facilitate their immersion) -- then someone must take on the duty of telling everyone else "here's what you see" and "here's what that goal/action requires" and "when you try that, here's what happens".<br/><br/>So I see two solutions: <br/><br/>(1) Use an automated GM, like a computer, or a protocol for rolling on tables for everything.  Allow every human at the table to just play a character.  <a href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">@Hasimir</a> is working on stuff that's somewhat in this direction, although his designs so far do put some "GM-like" responsibilities on the players.  There's also the <a href="http://www.mythic.wordpr.com/page14/page9/page9.html" rel="nofollow">Mythic GM Emulator</a> and spinoffs like <a href="http://noonetoplay.blogspot.com/2013/11/prototype-solo-rpg-engine.html" rel="nofollow">this one</a>, though somehow I've never heard any actual play accounts of these.<br/><br/>(2) Find a way to immerse in GMing which is not <i>identical</i> to playing a character, but is as close as possible.  This really depends on what part of immersion is most important to you.  Personally, I can get my immersive kicks as GM in any game which allows me to think from within the fiction, and imagine the ongoing events as if I'm there in the room with the player characters, even though there's no "me" there.  The way I achieve this is to offload all meta-level thoughts to my prep, so that I can respond in the moment with an intuitive sense of "what would happen" rather than planning and considering "what would make for the best story / best game / best session /etc."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_443700">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/443700/#Comment_443700" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2015-03-05T01:06:02+00:00" title="March  5, 2015  1:06AM">March 2015</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2015 1:06AM by JDCorley.">edited March 2015</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I actually think that when portraying NPCS, "just play the NPCs" will serve virtually all game functions better than anything else.

What you wind up doing, when things really sizzle, is spending a fair amount of time being audience and being astonished at what the players do.<br/><br/>What you do, then, is play to open things up. I've seen people do this, and I've done it, sometimes by accident (e.g., the Trail of Cthulhu session where, for reasons of "where is this NPC going", the NPC was functionally mute -- which meant that when the PCs argued about what to do with him, that was the heart and soul of things and I'd managed to arrange things so that I couldn't just have him pipe up and ruin the moment).<br/><br/>You understand, this isn't easy. Well, I mean, it's sometimes easy, but mostly, a skill like any other that one hones with practice. But, there is a path.<br/><br/>It's similar to being a larp GM (she says, still recovering from Intercon O) and writer. I write each character passionately -- and then, when you get it, it's Not Mine. I stare in amazement in between answering questions (and running to my fellow GMs for stuff I'm still hazy on).<br/><br/>There's a bit of a tension in that there needs to be enough to the NPCs, but not so much it feels like the NPCs' game -- and, to a certain degree, the setting is an NPC.<br/><br/>But, what we get at its best is a feedback loop of awesome. And a lot of the theory (most?) is trying to bottle that awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
