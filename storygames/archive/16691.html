Around half of them stay until the end or close-enough to the end ("retention", who comes up with these fucking words anyway).<br/><br/>Of course the longer a show is up the more hits it gets and then sometimes someone will like it and subscribe, and so on.<br/><br/>Does anyone know if these are amazingly great numbers or abysmally terrible numbers?  Are there other RPG video chat serieses that I could compare to/correspond with to see if they could compare numbers? Yes, we started doing this without even glancing to see if there were others doing the exact same thing a billion times better than we ever could.

But, they are your numbers, which is important. Truly though, it's all about your intentions behind the effort. Do you want thousands of people wanting to be a fanboy or do you want people to consider and care about the subjects you want to bring up? Those aren't the only two options, but you probably understand what I'm getting at.<br/><br/>For what I do, I get about 100-150 people per day to visit the podcast and the majority find us via search engines when trying to find generic 'nerd' stuff like zombies. Placating the social norms of 'nerd' culture is an easy way to generate more hits and potentially get the audience you want. It's another way of cold-calling if you think about it.<br/><br/>Another thing is that it makes sense why your retention is around halfway. I saw two of your group's videos and the first half is an unexpected side topic that isn't related to the video title. That turns off Youtube viewers very quickly. Get to the actual topic first, then if they are enjoying the subject, bring on the side topic. It's very important when it comes to presentation.<br/><br/>Last thing; presentation is the most important thing when recording video. You probably know that already, but I see a few flaws from those videos in relation to presentation. You set up the camera to easily show the speakers, but you make it difficult to retain the sense of direction. One example is the 11th show, Threat or Menace. Because you were in the middle, when you wanted to show you were trying to talk to both people, it looked awkward and turned me off from the conversation at hand. Your clothing style also makes people hesitant from watching them. If it wasn't for me being curious about this thread, I wouldn't have watched it because your dress style gave the impression of serious face discussion and the typical boring middle class businessman who plays D&amp;D.<br/><br/>I see potential in the program and I hope you continue it. You should do yourself a favor and make a few tweaks to broaden your initial appeal so people can become enticed and enjoy the real substance of the material.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382058">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382058/#Comment_382058" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T10:39:19+00:00" title="June 12, 2012 10:39AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Last thing; presentation is the most important thing when recording video.

Any thoughts on this would help.<br/><br/>Thanks for the feedback, I dither about leaping right in or not. We do keep the same retention in videos where we have a side topic at the start and those where we don't. Our prior 200 shows had multiple topics covered, so that is a bit of a legacy holdover.  The only show with unusually high retention was one where we hit a gaming theory topic. (I assume anyone interested in gaming theory these days is obsessively interested and we couldn't have pried them off the discussion with a crowbar, especially if they thought it was stupid.)<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_382084">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle" title="Alex_Swingle"><img alt="Alex_Swingle" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Alex_Swingle">Alex_Swingle</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382084/#Comment_382084" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T13:21:13+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  1:21PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>We just don't have room or additional cameras to make the normal "panel" layout of television work (host in center facing camera, guests to either side facing each other).

I apologize for making the assumption. It felt like that was the initial problem based on my experience with it. As far as the camera position/panel position, I can think of a few options for you to consider.<br/><br/>1. Camera Harness. If your camera weighs less than a 1,000 pounds, you may want to try having your camera man wear a harness and position the camera as the discussion flows. Camera harnesses usually have a steady mount to prevent that shady camera look, so you should be fine if you purchase/borrow/barter for one.<br/><br/>2. Reposition the seating to fit your style of communication. The panel is already slightly angled (almost a straight line), but if you increase it to enable better visual access, you'll be less likely to flop like a fish. The only downside is you'll won't have full access to the other panel members when it comes to their face on camera. I'm thinking a triangle formation with a top down angle wide shot for optimum visual access to the panel. A Trapezoid would also work and allow you to seat back a few inches for better head position throughout the discussion.<br/><br/>3. Stick to a person when they are talking, but focus more on the camera when responding. Use less possessive identifiers so you are less likely to quickly look at the person for recognition. Pretty much just refer to the person who made a point by name instead of the 'you' phrases. Use internal monologues as an example of what I mean.<br/><br/>4. Tell your panels members to be quick with their points in discussion and to wait until somebody is done talking. You as the main speaker should watch for cues so you don't jump on a potential rebuttal/addition from another panel member.<br/><br/>5. Reduce the number of panel members. Probably won't happen, but will prevent that problem.<br/><br/><br/>When it comes to your wardrobe, maybe consider something a little more casual or less bright colors for your collar. Maybe a different collar type would be best if you have one. The whole business man vibe I had was from the bright white collar sticking out, followed by the blue shirt. The red suit from 204 was a good example of that because it wasn't a distraction from the rest of your shirt. It blended well with the colors of your tie and such.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_382109">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/382109/#Comment_382109" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-12T16:02:50+00:00" title="June 12, 2012  4:02PM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 12, 2012 4:03PM by JDCorley.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My wardrobe is normally limited to what-I-wore-to-work-that-day...but I agree the red shirt looks way better, especially against that earthtone background.
