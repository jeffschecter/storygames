Until then, I'd hung around the Forge and designed a couple of things, but it hadn't really come together.<br/>\n<br/>\nI designed a game called Euthymia, which was all dystopian. I loved doing it. Most importantly, I got more feedback in that week than I'd had for months beforehand. It was a real learning experience for me. It's one reason why I really like the forum-based nature of Game Chef, as it was, because it really helped me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe other thing that was really useful was giving feedback on other people's designs. You spot what works and what doesn't and that all feeds back into your own designs.<br/>\n<br/>\nMaking a game in such a short time is easy. You throw around ideas for a couple of days, in your head, then put some mechanics in and start writing. It won't be good, but you'll get it done, and then you can go back and see what was good and what wasn't.<br/>\n<br/>\nGraham                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227797">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227797/#Comment_227797" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T05:07:32+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  5:07AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't think Game Chef has helped me improve anything, but the challenge is a wonderful creative constraint, and has spurred me to start (and finish) some things I'm really happy about.

Today I would have redone the system and made it much simpler. There are cool ideas in the game that I might cannibalize later - but it's mostly part of a design style that I don't work in these days. I worked on it for a while after Game Chef, but it never really caught anybody's interest, so I abandoned it. It's available on the <a "="" class="bbcode_url" href="http://norwegianstyle.wordpress.com/2007/12/06/charles-the-bald-is-superfed-tall-tales-of-conquest/" rel="nofollow">N\xf8rwegian Style</a> site.<br/>\n<br/>\nJason &amp; co was an idea that crashed completely in playtest.

If I remember rightly I took second place with Liquid Crystal. My 2007 offering wasn't quite so strong, but I liked it anyway.

However it usually does provide some interesting inspiration for game concepts that I wouldn't otherwise consider writing, so it's more valuable to me as a source of inspiration.<br><br>I'm happy with the status of my Game Chef games as of the end of the competitions, but I often think about revising, expanding, illustrating and re-releasing my favourite entry from a different contest (Reversed Engineer) because Dream Catcher's mechanics are amongst my favourites. They could use a little tweaking, but I don't have the money for illustrations so there's not much impetus for me to go ahead and rewrite it.

Before Game Chef, I had never tried writing a playable draft of a game and I don't think I really succeeded that year either, since I picked a concept that was a bit too ambitious to be achieved in a week. This also happened with my second Game Chef in 2003, though the stuff I generated then would later go on to inspire parts of John Harper's Agon.  I think that's an important thing, actually.  A immense amount of brainstorming and creation happens in Game Chef and it's hard to know who will find stuff that you create interesting or helpful and when the results of that will actuall manifest.  Most games are flash in the pan and disappear, but this doesn't mean that they don't have an impact.<br/><br/>My 2004 game actually got finished -- actually inspired by Tiki Gods from GC 2003, speaking of unexpected influences -- and I still remember 2004 as my favorite of all the contests.  Really cool stuff was flying around -- Mountain Witch, Polaris, Ganakagok, Dance and the Dawn, and so many others -- plus, by then, I knew some of the folks (though not in person) involved and it felt like I really want working alongside a group of peers. <br/><br/>2005 I was a judge and may have been responsible for the Shab Al-Hiri Roach not winning. That was my first encounter with Jason Morningstar, actually.  2006 attempted another ambitious game that was never finished but may come out in some form next year, since I finally know how to write it. 2007 was another ambitious, incomplete game. 2008 I made something playable but not actually complete or really wholly functional.  And now, in 2009, I'm running it.<br/><br/>So I guess my war story is... you don't necessarily have to design something on the edge of your ability, because that will make the contest much harder to finish.  I tend to pick a concept and premise that I don't already know how to render as a roleplaying game.  For example, 2006 was: a group of bodhisattvas sort through all of human experience to try to find the beings that will create the world to come.  And then I try to figure out how to make that game work over the course of the contest.  The problem with this approach -- which has led me to learn a great deal about design but only produce 1 finished Game Chef game -- is that it's too much work, I think, to both figure out how to design a completely new type of game and write/playtest your game in the same short period of time (a week or two).  It would have been better, I think, to pick a game concept that I mostly know how to write and then be surprised by the unexpected things that inevitably come up when you work on a creative project.  In this respect, the designs I've done for smaller contests -- Shreyas' lesbian ninja contest, Jason's Sight &amp; Sound, Graham's Lil' Game Chef last year -- have been much more successful because I didn't treat them as the Big Shindig in which I must prove my EXTREME DESIGN CHOPS.<br/><br/>My other advice is to write something for your home gaming group, something that they'll get really excited about playing/playtesting and you'll be really excited to play with them.  Like I said earlier, the vast majority of Game Chef games are flash-in-the-pan designs that we never hear from again.  But if you can go as far as to actually play them, I think the likelihood of them being both 1) successful as games and 2) helpful in your overall development as a designer -- even if you only play them once -- is much greater.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227829">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227829/#Comment_227829" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T09:25:01+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  9:25AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last year was my first Game Chef. I did Little Game Chef as well...so maybe that was 2 years ago? I can't remember the sequence of events. So anyway.<br/><br/>Best part was making online friends that I've gotten to know much better the past (couple?) year(s?). I believe this came directly from my offer to trade critiques, one-for-one. I think I turned over 10 detailed critiques and got some really good feedback as well (as well as some nice-but-not-specifically-useful attaboys). The fact that so few (compared to the # of entries) folks took up my offer was enlightening.<br/><br/>Worst part was, *for me* (so don't get your panties in a wad), a sense of general disconnectedness in my head after the event. There's a lot in that to unpack...lemme see. Like, I totally didn't connect with the Jeep entries, and their presence felt like either a distraction or proselytizing. And watching what did, and did not, gain the general attention of the event usually left me either discouraged or confused. On that note, I thought the anonymous submission system in LGC went a long way in my mind toward softening that second bit.<br/><br/>The general negativity of some old-time GC participants was also kind of a buzzkill. I now know who to ignore, next time through.<br/><br/>Mostly it was a chance to "get" the indie lets-make-a-game hobby folks better. It prompted me to start doodling on actual design again, after more than a decade away from it. And I made some friends. So I'll be doing it again this year I think.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227832/#Comment_227832" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T09:31:45+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  9:31AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jonathan Walton</cite>2005 I was a judge and may have been responsible for the Shab Al-Hiri Roach not winning.

After judging, I'm going to post a revision / playtesting thread.  Are you ready to hash it through with me?"<br/><br/>I can't really say it better now. The game referenced is Polaris, btw.<br/><br/>Edit: Okay, I have a lot more to say. For a lot of people, including me, Iron Chef is their first real live-fire experience with game design. I mean, sure, lots of tweaking and twiddling and a game for your friends (I'd written a couple of LARP systems and half of a system for an individual tabletop campaign), but here's a game, and it's yours and you're designing it in front of <i>God and everyone</i>. And you can't fuck around and be coy with tinkering around your social mechanics or some bullshit. Get it done, get it complete, get it out.<br/><br/>I strongly, strongly suggest designing your game in a week. Take the first three days for concept, basic rules, and basic structure, take the rest of the time to fill out that basic structure with shit like skills or trait lists or spells (if you've written a game that doesn't require it, write examples. Or just drink gin.) Then do playtesting and bullshit or, better yet, don't. Let it sit for six months, reread it, revise it, <i>then</i> do your playtesting.<br/><br/>A few months ago, someone asked me about my creative process regarding Polaris. At the time, I was living in Beijing, the first time in my life I'd ever lived outside of the US. During the time of the contest, I was studying Chinese around 12 hours a day during the week, going out drinking and dancing all night on the weekends, and swimming in a sea of strange language, which probably comes across in <a href="http://benlehman.livejournal.com/28225.html" rel="nofollow">the original text</a>.

My submission was called Stained Glass; a game about knights of a mystical order being interviewed by a celestial council to ascertain worthiness for canonization as a saint of the order.  The concept was interesting; but being relatively new to hippie games, I struggled to find the truly important elements of the concept that should be supported by the mechanics.  In the end I essentially used a stripped down version of the DitV conflict mechanic and the game fell flat.  I haven't touched the game since.<br/><br/>In 2007, I had every intention of participating in the Game Chef event; but on the opening weekend of that Game Chef, on the way to visit my parents, my wife got hit with a really nasty Gall Bladder attack that culminated in surgery to remove the glogged organ.  As a result, I was unable to get a game written by the deadline.  I decided to continue writing my game unofficially, even though I wouldn't be able to submit.  As a result, I developed a game called Keystone Crimewave, a lighthearted competitive game designed for larg-ish groups.  The players are split into two 'teams' - the crooks who are planning a heist, and the cops who are trying to catch them.  The game was inspired by movies such as Disorganized Crime, the Big Hit, Snatch, Police Academy, A Fish Called Wanda, Hot Fuzz, and many other movies of that vein.  I managed to write the majority of the game's rules; but did so old school style, with a pen and paper.  I have yet to finish transcribing all those rules into an electronic medium.  I think the game, however rough, would be playable as a sort of party game.  If I ever manage to find my original notes, I may actually finish transcribing them and try to playtest the game.<br/><br/>Last year, I entered Game Chef and developed a game called Witch Hunt.  It was by far my most complete and most viable game of any of my Game Chef attempts.  It's still very rough; but I was lucky enough to have a group playtest it once so far (not a group I was part of).  With some hard work I might be able to turn it into a decent game.  I recently dusted it off to do some work on a Beta playtest version of it; I don't know how long it'll be before I have such a thing done though.<br/><br/>I missed out on Graham Walmsley's Little Game Chef earlier this year; but I do hope to participate in the upcoming Game Chef.  It should be extra interesting now that Game Chef is under new management, so to speak.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth" title="Elizabeth"><img alt="Elizabeth" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Elizabeth">Elizabeth</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227882/#Comment_227882" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T10:53:37+00:00" title="August 26, 2009 10:53AM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            In my experience, Game Chef is much better for getting all of my friends to yell at each other all the time than it is for getting me to produce an actual game.

But I had some interesting ideas that might be worth revisiting.<br/><br/>In 2007, I designed a game that got lost in the Game Chef shuffle.  But I playtested it a half dozen times and while it has serious flaws it is also a lot of fun to play.  I recently picked this game back up again after two years, for another round of playtesting with my friends before I run it at a con in November.<br/><br/>Last year I made a game that I'm proud of, though I have never played it.  It was reportedly played once in Italy.  Somehow, it "won" "Best Game", about which I still don't know quite how to feel.  Game Chef last year had a "judging and winning doesn't matter" vibe, so then when I win, what is that really worth?  I'll be happier this year with no judging or winners or losers, I think.  Just making another game I can be proud of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan" title="Bret_Gillan"><img alt="Bret_Gillan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://gasmaskgames.com/files/images/gasmask32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bret_Gillan">Bret_Gillan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227956/#Comment_227956" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T13:23:24+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  1:23PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Last year was my first year.

It's been awhile, but I remember the contest experience being very enjoyable and friendly. There probably wasn't more than a dozen or so entries back then and that had a lot to do with that feeling I think.<br/>\n<br/>\nTiki God was built to stand primarily on its color, with drunk-simple mechanics, so the two week time limit wasn't a problem. I had enough time to make a nice collage cover image and throw some friendly taunts at the other contestants. It was a good time and allowed me to blow off some creative steam in a manner that I wouldn't have if left to my own devices.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think there's mainly two ways to approach a two-week GC contest. Try to design a two-week game, a game that can look well designed, functional, and fun given two weeks to produce it. Try to design a game that needs somewhere closer to six months of thought and development to really come together, have your contest entry show shadowy but promising possibilites, and if you're still intrigued by the idea after the contest continue to work on it. From what Jonathan wrote above, he is obviously aware of this and I assume it's one of the reasons this coming GC will be a multiple deadline affair.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_227974">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White" title="Bill_White"><img alt="Bill_White" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/414/nOKQF0WDRJ0W7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bill_White">Bill_White</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227974/#Comment_227974" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T14:11:32+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  2:11PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote <a href="http://www.ganakagok.com" rel="nofollow">a game</a> for Game Chef 2004; a sim fantasy of a quasi-Inuit tribe on an island of ice. It was a kind of lonely fun -- there I was in the middle of Pennsylvania, teaching my courses and not really getting anything else done; certainly not playing anything. But I went back to NJ to run it at Dreamation 2005 for exactly three players, who went on a quest to defeat the sun before it rose and succeeded. The stuff that made it sim was broken badly, but there was something there, so I kept working on it. A few times I thought it was done, and printed some copies on Lulu to hawk at cons, but the whole "half-baked games" thing a few years ago threw me for a loop, so I decided to pull it until it was finished. Finally, after years and years of running it and cons and making incremental changes -- mainly involving throwing out the rules I thought I needed -- I brought the finished product to Gencon this year and ran demos and plugged the game. So now it's done. And when people ask me, "How did you come up with the idea for this game, how do you say it, Ganka-wha?" I have to tell them "Game Chef 2004." And they mainly say, "Oh, that's why it reminds me of Polaris."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_227978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/227978/#Comment_227978" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-26T14:16:51+00:00" title="August 26, 2009  2:16PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bill, I think it's totally awesome that both Ganakagok and Dance &amp; the Dawn are finally "done done" this year, after 5 years of off-and-on development since 2004.

I'd been futzing to myself for some time about like, maybe designing a game, y;know, sometime, about, er, something. . .but GC2008 kicked my but into serious gear with (A) tight time constraints, (B) unanticipated creative prompts and (C) a productive atmosphere of mutual accountability, encouragement and feedback.<br/><br/>Unpacking that: first, writing a game in a week needed I needed to DO it. Like Ben said, there's no hemming or hawing about halfway functional resolution mechanics or that incomplete magic system or whatever. No buts. Just sit down in the workshop, and make an automobile that cranks over when you turn the key. If you can drive it, sputterking, around the block, so much the better. (I'm currently attempting to kick myself into gear thusly with <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=28599.0" rel="nofollow">my growing-pains fairytale game</a> for <a href="http://www.goplaypdx.com/forum/index.php?topic=595.0" rel="nofollow">Jake's Awesome Contest</a>.)<br/><br/>The factor of outside creative prompts is actually the biggest reason I'm attracted to design contests: "Uh, I don't have any ideas! Someone tell me what to write about!" If you tell someone to 'think of something cool!" or "say something brilliant!" they freeze (Graham talks about this, of course), but if you ask, "what sort of game would you write about Unicorns?" you'll get an interesting response, or provoke interesting thought. It's totally what I need when I'm presented with the wide vista of "anything" that I could be writing a game (or a story, or a song, or. . .) about. The art "ingredients" of the '08 contest provided me with the fodder for a game I'm proud of and enjoy thoroughly, and would <i>never</i> have thought of designing on my own. (Also, the artists, David Bove and Donna K. Fitch have been gracious enough to grant me the full use of that art merely for the courtesy of attribution, which is a great boon for a passionate amateur designer with no budget.)<br/><br/>The forum atmosphere was pretty cool and helpful for me, as I recall. For starters, I was strongly encouraged by my feedback loop to run with the most audacious and ambitious of my game ideas, which I might have shied away from otherwise. And the general encouragement atmosphere, indeed the very <i>knowledge</i> that others know of my labors and are striving alongside me, helped me push forward to finish the design in time. The only downside of the system was that after that intense week of brainwork, it was hard to muster the energy for mutual feedback. but I believed in the system, and forged ahead with it. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> And come to think of it, some of the feedback was kind of awkward because folks were confused about what a fresh Game Chef entry is supposed to <i>be</i>. F'rinstance, telling me I need some examples of characters or whatever is a bit disheartening because <i>my </i>week's work went into the raw game mechanisms, examples can come later, right? Then again, such comments DID hel;p inform what needs to go into the more fleshed-out text, so it's all good.<br/><br/><br/>Now, after the dust has settled, I've found that the experience was creatively rewarding and productive. My game, <a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product_info.php?products_id=63117" rel="nofollow">Spectre of the Beast</a> has gone forward to a fun, playable and maturing design, with an ashcan and everything. I found I had to put it in a drawer and let my brain rest, then come back to it in like 8 or 10 months and dust it off to get it readable and playable. And I found that I had a for-real game on my hands, not just a nice theoretical exercise, and that others could play it and have fun. Which isn't surprising, I suppose, because I've never been able to throw myself into a creative exercise without "meaning it"--this song, however silly, is meant to be <i>sung</i>; this story, however stilted, is meant to be <i>read</i>; this game, however experimental, is meant to be <i>played.</i><br/><br/>I'm not entering GC this year, partly because i'm still fine-tuning my LAST entry, AND I've found other contests this year to fill that role. There's Jake's Fantasy Contest, above, and also Joe's 2nd Edition of Irrevocably Broken Games contest, which is past deadline and I'm totally backburnering at this point (in fact, I think it's time to divest myself of the identity of Jopel Kuresaare). But like I said, when I work on a thing I <i>mean</i> it, and whenever I return to the grand revision of Brilliant Aura, it's for real, no matter how joking the contest framing is.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_228218">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/228218/#Comment_228218" name="Item_24" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-08-27T13:38:58+00:00" title="August 27, 2009  1:38PM">August 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: lachlan</cite>That was my second contest, which taught me that I'm capable of coming up with more than one game (because I had now come up with<i>two</i>).

My entry to Game Chef seemed to be at the centre of some of the controversy and drama. So, what did I learn?<br/><br/>Go for it.<br/><br/>As soon as the concept started to take shape, I knew that it might go horribly, horribly wrong, that some people might get angry, that I might not be able to explore the subject matter with the delicacy it needed, but I took a chance and have never regretted it. Since then I have felt much more free to tackle game design concepts that I might otherwise have put aside for fear of how people might react. My entry to Little Game Chef reflected that, even though it wasn't controversial.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
