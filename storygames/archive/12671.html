In it, he waxes rhapsodic about the possibility of finally, officially being able to roleplay in the universe of <i>Warhammer 40,000</i>, something he'd wanted to do for 20 years.<br/><br/>Now I'm sure he played in a few home-grown games, but there's something about picking up a big, glossy book full of beautiful art and mechanics dedicated to bringing 40K to life.  He was pretty damned excited about <i>Dark Heresy</i>, and I'm pretty damned excited about <a href="http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=108" rel="nofollow">Deathwatch</a>.<br/><br/>To me, Space Marines are where the 40K universe starts.  This doesn't mean I discount the Inquisition and all those Rogue Traders out there looking for their fortunes.  But when I think 40K I immediately think Adeptus Astartes and <i>Deathwatch</i> is all about bringing these super-warriors to life.

Call me relentlessly old-school to some degree, but when I start reading about the various modifiers stacking up to create moments of \xfcber-destruction... it makes me all gooey inside.  There's just something about the number-crunching that appeals to me at a base level, or maybe it's just because I'm used to it because of the WFRP connection.  I certainly don't enjoy it when dealing with D&amp;D, so it may be a localized phenomenon.<br/><br/>And I just wanna play a Space Marine!  Space Marine!  Space Marine!  They could put out the clunkiest system imaginable and I'd probably be there waving the flag for it just because it allows me to imagine putting on the power armor and laying the holy smack down on the Emperor's enemies.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284611">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284611/#Comment_284611" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T08:34:10+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  8:34AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2010 8:34AM by Sam!.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Pete</cite>I find the Orks really... jarring.

Like, I'm imagining some players familiar with 40K and thinking orks are jokes suddenly having to rethink things when an ork boarding party attacks their ship, and they see an 8-foot-tall brute reduce some of their shipmates to limbs, and no matter how much they shoot it it just keeps coming at them with this huge slab of sharpened metal attached to the end of a pole.<br/><br/>As for what's appealing about them for me, I love that they are not evil but are still a chaotic and destructive force. They're just truly alien in that they have a philosophy that humans don't understand. They love fighting and battle, don't really see the consequences of fighting and battle as that bad at all, and it has never occurred to them that the other races of the universe don't feel the same way.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284613/#Comment_284613" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T08:37:59+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  8:37AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            While I've always been a fan of 40k fluff, both Dark Heresy and Rogue Trader don't really appeal to me because they always seemed to deal with the larger than life movers and shakers of the 40k world.

I remember inquisitors from the 40k days of my youth and may have assumed that the game focused more on them.  Also, I recall abandoning 40k around the time the inquisition became its own faction so, in my mind, they are still single, high-power figures.  Still, the Inquisition is relatively powerful as an organization.  I'd rather play core parts of the chain of command with a focus on the military aspects rather than the religious zealotry/agendas.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284622">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284622/#Comment_284622" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T09:15:44+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  9:15AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's going to have to compete with 3:16 for "RPG that feels like 40k" for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284624/#Comment_284624" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T09:23:55+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  9:23AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 6, 2010 10:19AM by Sam!.">edited August 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<i>3:16</i> is pretty cool, but it seems to me that it has limited utility as a <i>roleplaying</i> game.

For me, the 40k universe is better when it is less defined. The miniatures game, for instance, pales for me in comparison to the crazy fiction and artwork surrounding the universe. 3:16 allows me to dabble in that setting creatively without getting bogged down in details and relative measures/stats.<br/><br/>And as far as roleplaying goes, I seriously doubt that either system can claim superiority in that regard. The Dark Heresy system is focused on tactical combat as much as 3:16 focuses on carnage and gimmicks. I will point out that the Strengths and Weaknesses in 3:16 can easily evoke some form of roleplaying and/or flashback scenes.<br/><br/>In the end though, you have to keep in mind that most Space Marines have an anonymous feel to them. Even in the fiction that GW puts out, one marine is often only two adjectives away from any other marine. (This one is surly and mechanically-inclined. The other is courageous and foolhardy.) Space Marines are kind of walking piles of armor and weapons. And their minds have been programmed by the Emperor.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_284645">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf" title="greatwolf"><img alt="greatwolf" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/891/nW2DRVYU2ADQK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/greatwolf">greatwolf</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284645/#Comment_284645" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T11:11:55+00:00" title="August  6, 2010 11:11AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Sam!</cite>To me, Space Marines are where the 40K universe starts.

Basically, you can have the Marines take on individual enemies or hordes. When they fight individual enemies, it's pretty much the same as the other two 40K RPGs. When the Marines fight hordes, it works differently.<br/><br/>Hordes have a "Magnitude" which works likes hit points. A point of magnitude can represent "tens, scores, or even hundreds". When a horde is attacked, each individual hit that causes any amount of damage knocks off a point of magnitude. So, it kind of abstracts things. Say the horde coming at you is Magnitude 25. Well, maybe it's 25 guys, or 250, or 2500! It depends on what you're fighting.<br/><br/>Fire your bolter into the horde on full-auto, get, say, three hits, and you've taken off 3 points of magnitude (and you can describe how you just took down thirty enemies, or whatever). You don't roll for damage when fighting hordes, you're just looking to get as many hits as possible. Blast weapons like grenades do hits equal to their blast rating - a frag grenade is 5 so it does 5 hits.<br/><br/>Hordes roll for morale ("breaking") if they lose 25% of their Magnitude in one turn, and when they're down to 50% or less. Hordes that close for melee attack everyone adjacent, and increase their damage based on the size of the horde. You also can't Dodge or Parry when fighting a horde since they're all over you. This can be really bad - a heretic with an axe normally does 1d10+5 - not likely to hurt a Marine who can shrug off 16 points of damage to begin with. But a magnitude 25 horde adds 1d10 damage for every ten points of Magnitude, so that makes the horde of heretics with axes do 3d10+5 and that is something even a Marine has to worry about if the mob takes him down and starts hacking.<br/><br/>Hordes can used ranged attacks if they have the capability too. Fun!<br/><br/>The adventure has several battles like this. One has 'stealer cultists fighting planetary defense forces and you (the Marines) get to bolster the defenders and wade in and kick ass. The Marines do kick ass. Where in Dark Heresy, you may have a hard time of it, in Deathwatch, you go through hordes like a hot knife through butter. Marine Ballistic Skill averages around 40 to start, and with character bonus and whatnot, you might be starting with a base of 50 or more. Go full-auto (+20%) , firing into a horde isn't to hard so take another 20% and you could be looking at 90%. So in some cases it's not so much that you're trying to hit, you're trying to hit as often as you can since you score an additional hit for every degree of success you get, up to the RoF of your weapon. Marines will Fuck Shit Up.<br/><br/>And then when you face the big bads worthy of one-on-one combat, like a genestealer patriarch, you throw down by the usual rules.<br/><br/>But beyond the horde rules, what I'm liking about Deathwatch is the group-based Talents. So, you can go off and be a Space Wolf and get special Space Wolf only cool things you can do, or you can be down with your kill-team Brothers and all tap into shared Talents, and get shared group bonuses and effects as long as you're all working as a team. <br/><br/>In the game we played, we had maybe 4 big battles with hordes and although we bested them, they still knocked off a few points on our side. Enough that we had to worry about it. And when we faced the Big Bad and his minions at the end, two of our Marines got gutted and only two survived.<br/><br/>What was cool is, it felt like the fluff. We were super-human warriors taking on hordes of enemies and winning, and then facing down even more powerful individual foes that a normal human would stand no chance of defeating.<br/><br/>So no, it's not a Story Game, but is does do the job in its own way pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284704">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike" title="Steerpike"><img alt="Steerpike" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/73053145/4961238"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steerpike">Steerpike</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284704/#Comment_284704" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-06T17:12:33+00:00" title="August  6, 2010  5:12PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds pretty fucking awesome actually...

I may give Deathwatch a try... I don't mind the WFRP 2e-based rules at all, as we tend to ignore most of them in "narrative" mode and dive into the crunch when there's an interesting fight happening. I do think the rules give a good level of tactical crunch and visceral action, and it'll be cool to see how they hold up on a super human scale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284746">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21" title="Sam!"><img alt="Sam!" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.samhawken.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/loganmugg32.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sam%21">Sam!</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284746/#Comment_284746" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-07T07:24:30+00:00" title="August  7, 2010  7:24AM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mike Montesa</cite>The Marines do kick ass. Where in Dark Heresy, you may have a hard time of it, in Deathwatch, you go through hordes like a hot knife through butter. Marine Ballistic Skill averages around 40 to start, and with character bonus and whatnot, you might be starting with a base of 50 or more. Go full-auto (+20%) , firing into a horde isn't to hard so take another 20% and you could be looking at 90%. So in some cases it's not so much that you're trying to hit, you're trying to hit as often as you can since you score an additional hit for every degree of success you get, up to the RoF of your weapon. Marines will Fuck Shit Up.</blockquote>\nYes.  If nothing else, <i>Deathwatch</i> has completely eliminated the "whiff factor" that many complained about with <i>Dark Heresy</i>.

Its a LOT of gathering as many bad-ass weapons and armor as you can, and taking every dirty advantage you can to wipe out your enemies.<br/>And yes, particularly in Dark Heresy, there's a LOT of suck when you're a low-level minion of an Inquisitor. There's lots of opportunities for you to get turned into paste, mutated, eaten, blown up, melted, or fed to the Emperor.<br/>But it works if you have a GM who ISN'T going to use your failures as an excuse to do the most horrible, disgusting thing possible to your character.<br/>And again, once you use every advantage you can for a given situation, you can often get some tasty bonuses to your attempts.<br/><br/>We had a pretty good campaign, that had a fairly "ecclectic" collection of fuck-ups: an assassin who insisted on using two blades (even though he built the character more for ranged weapons...), a Psyker, couple of soldiers, and my scum (based loosely on Dave Lister of Red Dwarf). For as much crap trouble we got ourselves into, and for as many morally ambigious decisions we had to make, it was pretty fun. Of course, it all went downhill when our GMs switched and the new guy hadn't bothered to read some of the fine details about how the rules work.<br/><br/>I must admit that the 40k rules aren't much of a "story game" system, though the Rogue Trader does have quite a bit about building up your character from past experiences, which is really nice. It is meant to be crunchy, brutal, and full of dark badness, and does that pretty well.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_284956">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/orklord" title="orklord"><img alt="orklord" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/919/nBSO1M13J7CVK.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/orklord">orklord</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/284956/#Comment_284956" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-08-09T13:24:23+00:00" title="August  9, 2010  1:24PM">August 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Bret Gillan</cite>Oh my goodness.
