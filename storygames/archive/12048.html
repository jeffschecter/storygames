I offered to run a beta Danger Patrol for three of them last Sunday.  I've played FATE a few times with Mal but Eric and Nate haven't played much from the "hippy catalog."<br/><br/>We determined previous to the game that we would lean towards a Venture Bros. flavor.  I suspected it would trend that way anyway 'cause that's how we roll. <br/><br/>I opened with a teaser I'd used once before, the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=9929&amp;page=1#Item_5" rel="nofollow">Titanic Trouble</a> setup with Princess Naalil except I used four pairs of hover-bike duo Threats instead of three, each with only two hits needed to eliminate them rather than three.  <br/><br/>I like big <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/Mysterio2.jpg" rel="nofollow">Mysterio</a>-style helmets for dastardly minions in a DP teaser because you can have have a reveal either during or after the action scene where the characters discover that the actors are of a particular type from a player's "Previously On..."<br/><br/>Everyone drew their Style and Role cards at random and traded a bit amongst each other to arrive at their heroes.  The cast:<br/><br/>Eric's intrepid Professor Borium, renowned for his Theory of Emotional Geometry.  His Emotional Shape Dynamics courses at R.C.U. proved so popular he had to open his own school and think tank.  In the last episode, "The Shape Of Things To Come" we find that Princess Naalil has communicated with the good professor prior to the arrival of her delegation and is bringing him a newly discovered and as yet unstudied Shape of mysterious origin.  We learn also that the Danger Patrol recently lost its fourth member in battle and that the "Square of Trust" has been broken.<br/><br/>Nate's "S-7", the file designation given this man by Professor Borium who came to him for help only a few years ago.  Haunted by his exploration of both the outer reaches of the solar system as well as his probes into the mystical arts of the underworld, he gave only "Esssevian" as his moniker.  His travels through time and space as well as his troubles with space-women have made him emotionally distant and the professor is helping to give them the human shape they once had.  We discover in S-7's "Previously On" that he and Princess Naalil have a romantic past, a love forbidden by her station and the societal mores of the people of Titan.  Their most recent rift left S-7 severely emotionally damaged.  And angry.<br/><br/>Mal's Two-Fisted adventurer flyboy, Salvatore "Shifty" Smiles, genius entrepreneur, masterful masseur, and ace pilot.  Shifty's aviation and public transport empire and his garage of "Danger" vehicles are the envy of Rocket City, as well as the subject of frequent experimentation by Professor Borium.  This sometimes to the consternation of Shifty and his cadre of crackerjack mechanics.  Smiles is fearless, heroic and goddamn good-looking.  It was he who discovered in a previous episode that Stygian spies had broken into Professor Borium's Shape Lab and stolen some important research.<br/><br/>The heroes leap into action to ward off the hoverbike miscreants and save both Mayor Woodhull from transformation and Princess Naalil from abduction.  S-7, still angry at the princess, moves through the aura of blue energy surrounding the mayor to thwart her transmogrification.  Struck by the towering beauty of the aqua-skinned Naalil, Shifty hits the ignition switch on his rocket-pack and blasts towards her.  The professor's previous experimentation on Shifty's rocketpack, a project he'd begun but forgotten to complete, has a dangerous interaction with the tachyon instruments of the violin quartet and suddenly the musician's platform is aflame!  The professor applies himself admirably, using his Feng Shui jammer to discourage the villains about their angles of attack and inspiring speeches about the "Triangle of Teamwork" to spur on his teammates. <br/><br/>One by one the attackers are taken down.  S-7 moves past disorienting blue shapes and uses mystical techniques to heal Victoria Woodhull.  The Professor puts out the platform fire and saves a musician from toppling from Diamond Spire.  Shifty overcomes his wayward rocketpack and gets the princess to safety. The experimental turbo-boosters from Shifty's parked nearby "Danger Bus," enter the fray at one point.  Later, the helmet of one of the attackers is shattered by a raygun beam.  The Stygians from Shifty's "Previously On" are revealed!  Breaking from what little DP "canon" there is, I ask the players what Stygians look like.  Nate offers that they are lizardman-like.  Coming from Pluto they have their own atmosphere they're more accustomed to, air toxic after extended exposure to the denizens of the other nine planets.  A grey cloudy gas escapes the helmet and the final Stygian slumps to the ground, only two making their escape.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/uruush/4570177830/" rel="nofollow" title="DngrPtrl-1color by mgagan1, on Flickr"><img alt="DngrPtrl-1color" height="750" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4003/4570177830_996eced0ee_o.jpg" width="1000"/></a><br/><br/>The interludes include S-7 at a banquet scene between his former flame and a potential new interest, Professor Borium's shape dialogue with Princess Naalil's councilor, Hyperion, and Salavtore puttin' the sweet shifty moves on Princess Naalil.<br/><br/>There were three separate Suspense scenes: "What's Up With The Stygians?", "The Mystery of The Shape!", and "Can We Trust Hyperion?"<br/><br/>As with previous games, I wasn't entirely sure how to run these.  Some of the Danger I assigned immediately where it made sense and some I kept track of with the intent of adding it to whatever my baseline might be in the following action scene.  Checked Bashed boxes don't seem to make much sense in Suspense scenes sometimes.  Maybe just a mental adjustment needed.  I recall the Professor and S-7 didn't roll much danger, answering their mysteries relatively easily.  S-7 turns on and off the Stygian's "air" supply with hilarious effect as he interrogates them.  Professor Borium unlocks and names the mystery of the "Schr\xf6dahedron," a shape that is both there and not there, a shape that is also a dimension door with a partner shape though a wormhole to Pluto, the connection between the two somehow being the key to the mystical blockade of Titan.  The Stygians and the Crimson Republic are working together!  Shifty tries to tail Hyperion in the Danger Bus, but blows his cover when he runs into a floating traffic island.  He could try to continue to unlock the mystery of whether Hyperion's suspicious acts are caused by some larger conspiracy, but I offer that we could leave that question unanswered for now and Mal accepts, forgoing the risk of additional generated danger.<br/><br/>Hyperion joins the Danger Patrol on their wormhole journey to Pluto.  Using advanced shape technologies, mystical protections, and ace piloting, the group guides the Danger shortbus, "Danger II, Electric Boogaloo" to the Plutonian Temple of the Schr\xf6d-Cat.  They are faced there with Necron the Stygian high Shape priest and various Shape acolytes directing the energy of the partner Schr\xf6dahedron into a Crimson Republic Cruiser overhead, one with hull-mounted proton turrets.  Additionally, the disorienting journey unlocks something dangerous in the damaged psyche of Esssevian.  Before he can help with any of the other threats, he must conquer "The Anger Within S-7."<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/uruush/4569477294/" rel="nofollow" title="Danger Patrol Shrode-Cat by mgagan1, on Flickr"><img alt="Danger Patrol Shrode-Cat" height="768" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3489/4569477294_2a11b11cb3_b.jpg" width="1024"/></a><br/><br/>This action scene was pretty fun, I think.  I'd changed the initial bonus dice for each hero from 12 to 10 and implemented JH's change of either reducing their danger meters *or* renewing their bonus dice during the interlude.  The resource constraints were felt a bit in the second action scene.  I think S-7 was completely out of bonus dice before the very end (though he had some powers allowing him to generate more), and all the heroes were Injured.<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>    * Shifty totally "<a href="http://www.moviedeaths.com/flash_gordon/ming_the_merciless/" rel="nofollow">Mings</a>" the Stygian high priest with the business end of the Danger Shortbus, and keeps it together as it takes multiple hits from the cruiser.<br/>    * Professor Borium uses an experimental "swing juicer" to throw off the aim of the CR cruiser as he dives behind an explosive pyrite outcropping.<br/>    * The Stygian priests open a dimension door and summon a Plutonian T-Rex who picks up the Danger Shortbus in his jaws and shakes Shifty right out of it! A Baby T-Rex comes though the gate towards the end, one which S-7 eventually tames using his Explorer trait.<br/>    * S-7 masters his anger and takes an important step towards healing his psychic wounds.  He wraps up the baddies in a sweet Malakar net to boot.<br/>    * Borium's old rival Count Ivanovich, having parachuted from the exploding cruiser, is convinced by the professor to turn against the Stygian priests.  "Its right in front of you, Count! Think! Two shapes in one, the dinosaurs, the parade of evidence shaped like a giant arrow pointing at the Here and Now! Isn't it obvious you've been played? It's not too late..."<br/><br/>The session ends with A New Hope-style medal ceremony on Titan.  S-7's baby T-Rex gives a Chewbacca roar.  Cue the credits.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_269669">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269669/#Comment_269669" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-01T21:29:13+00:00" title="May  1, 2010  9:29PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We were all a bit tired by the end but I think the game was a hit on the whole!  Everyone seemed to enjoy adding dangers/color/facts to the scenes with each heroic action taken.  Nate is really busy with several commissions right now but was enthusiastic enough to sketch the group's Danger Bus shortly after the game and then do a vignette of the opening action sequence atop Diamond Spire.  Thanks Nate!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/uruush/4569516905/" rel="nofollow" title="Danger-Bus-SAVE by mgagan1, on Flickr"><img alt="Danger-Bus-SAVE" height="758" src="http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4030/4569516905_06a0cc1666_b.jpg" width="1024"/></a><br/><br/>A few playtest notes:<br/><br/>Eric noted that the combination of Intrepid and Professor was a bit lacking; Intrepid's "One For All" and the Professor Role's "Crazy Theory" are identical.  It would be nice if these could be differentiated. <br/><br/>Any hero can mitigate a disaster, yes?  Not just the hero that "caused" it.<br/><br/>Mal commented that it gets increasingly hard to think of dangers to add to a given action.  This difficulty is felt by some players more than others.  I struggle some with that myself towards the end of a lengthy session.  For being a game with light-medium crunch and with such a light tone, Danger Patrol asks quite a bit of its players and GM in the way of mental agility.  In a good way!  But "improv fatigue"" is a bit of a factor.<br/><br/>I still struggle to keep an action/interlude/suspense/action arc a reasonable length.  If that whole arc could be easily kept to under four hours (and maybe it already is for some groups/GMs), the improv fatigue would be mitigated almost entirely.<br/><br/>A GM tip on the first action scene looking ahead to the second action scene: you should aim to get at least one box in the Stunned area of the Danger meter checked on at least one of the heroes.  They can otherwise all get rid of all their Bashed box checkmarks and will all start the second action scene almost completely fresh.<br/><br/>With repeated play I've gotten some more ideas for additional Threat moves.  There should be a variety of 1 and 2 Threat moves to choose from in particular to eliminate the frequency of the escalation and reduced hits outcomes.  Three total danger is a frequent result and there are often enough Threats on the board so a "1" and "2" move must be chosen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_269696">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Storn" title="Storn"><img alt="Storn" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Storn">Storn</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/269696/#Comment_269696" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-02T07:59:04+00:00" title="May  2, 2010  7:59AM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.
