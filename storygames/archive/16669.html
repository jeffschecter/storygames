I really don't have a lot of time to search the archives and this could have been put so many different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere's a lot of free indie games out there. I mean, just look at 1km1kt! But some of us like exploring them in different ways.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you've run across a free game recently - PLEASE DO NOT POST YOUR OWN HERE - that you really enjoyed and would like to discuss, I, for one, would love to hear about it. <br/>\n<br/>\nBecause this thread purports to be about free games and the authors of such games are receiving no remuneration I'd ask our normally enthusiastic developers to limit their direct criticism and post only encouragements - silence on a posted game will be painful enough. <br/>\n<br/>\nUsing that rule, I'm going to wait a few days before posting the games I thought were cool here (and if this list exists already, contact me and we'll work on ditching this thread.)                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_381196">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381196/#Comment_381196" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T09:35:08+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  9:35AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You mean like this thread, about ten below yours?<br/><a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15618" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=15618</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_381197">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Arpie" title="Arpie"><img alt="Arpie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/928/nJJYCX46ITB2V.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Arpie">Arpie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/381197/#Comment_381197" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-06-07T09:35:28+00:00" title="June  7, 2012  9:35AM">June 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 7, 2012 9:35AM by Arpie.">edited June 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Dang.
