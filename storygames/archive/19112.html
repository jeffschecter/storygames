I personally suck at these games (no eye hand coordination) but it was great fun watching the stories unfold. There is the first person shooter element, the resource gather element, the leveling up element, the cut scenes (though you often have little say here), and the beautiful graphics.<br/><br/>I found "The Last of Us" to be the best overall experience but enjoyed "State of Decay" as well. My job heated up so I've not gotten to dwell on GTA or the new Dead Rising but I want to. <br/><br/>So my question, which games hook you and how do they speak to story games? This is where the real money of the hobby is. It is worth looking at.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426610">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426610/#Comment_426610" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T16:00:42+00:00" title="January  4, 2014  4:00PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Project Zero ps2 old game but hooked me in with its cultural theme and camera shooting. <br/>The walk about nature of exploration works for me to.

So, my choices:<br/><br/><b>Fallout 3</b>:  This game almost made me want the Apocalypse to happen.  You emerge from a vault into an East Coast US devastated by atomic warfare.  The joy for me was exploring the landscape.  Entering buildings to loot stuff is a lottery, especially in the early games, where the orcs of the game, blowflies and giant ants can really do you in.  Later on in the game you pretty much crap yourself when you see an albino scorpion or a Deathclaw.  There are factions in the game you can align yourself with to a greater or lesser extent.  Some interesting characters - I liked the ghouls in the DC library.  Just a great immersive experience.<br/><br/><b>Morrowind</b>:  Before Skyrim and Oblivion there was Morrowind.  Again a fully realised land to explore and factions to interact with.  I'm gagging for a playthrough again but my current computer is incompatible with it.  No, I don't have an Win XP emulator.<br/><br/><b>Dragon Age</b>:  While the story and gameplay were more sucky for me than the previous two games you encountered a group of companions on your travels who help you fight.  Alistair is the most memorable, a reasonably competent swordsman who embodies an existential innocence.  I did get him to lose his rag with me when I made an alliance with a Blood Mage.  "What the bloody hell do you think you're doing?!" he yelled at me.  The reaction genuinely shocked me, much like an snap banishing in Sorcerer at a critical moment that actually works (serves me right for making Demon NPCs).  After his pompous response I hardly ever put him in the party again.  He'd get all huffy with me in the team choosing screen.  The .combat in this can be switched into turn-based mechanics so you needn't worry about hand-eye co-ordination.<br/><br/>There's also some learning disabled guy who crafts swords, who apparently can prophesy things.  "Enchantment"<br/><br/>It then can be a bit adolescent: you can get it it on with some of the members of your party.  Morrigan, the slightly sapphic woman, who likes it if you behave like some Ayn Rand wannabee, some elf guy who has probably got a knapsack full of kink toys, and the one who I kept trying it on with: a French-sounding lady who like the somewhat moral way in which I behaved.  I bought her a number of gifts to bump up her Love rating for me.  I got her to 99% and still could not get my end away.  Very much like life.<br/><br/><b>X-Com: Enemy Unknown</b>:  This is a turn-based tactical and strategic game so no button mashing.  You're repelling an alien invasion with an international squad of soldiers.  You can research and build things but then you send your team of soldiers out on a mission.  They get promoted and get greater abilities but the enemies get harder as well.  It is a real wrench when you have soldiers, whom you've taken through over 20 missions, die in combat.  I felt nauseous when it first happened.  Sure, you lose a number of rookies but these experienced soldiers are another matter entirely.  In your barracks there is a memorial where you can see the Name, Rank, Number of Missions they had been on and Number of Kills they made..  Looking at it can be moving, although bagpipe music plays in the background.  I think you've just missed it in the Steam sale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426613/#Comment_426613" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T18:04:22+00:00" title="January  4, 2014  6:04PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm big into video games myself, but I've unfortunately been pretty completely alienated from the mainstream of it ever since the late '90s. It's the commercial consumerism, and consequent lack of artistic ambition, that makes it difficult for me to care, relate or desire anything the market has to offer. Makes it a little annoying to see the recent prominence of the video game industry in Finland, really; a lot of evidently enthusiastic people making games that I care little for.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the indies, free gaming and historical gaming (or retro, as it's called in the scene) are very much a hobby of mine. I tend to be very critical of the storytelling movement in video game design, preferring game-like interactions (just like in tabletop gaming, really); all genres of game are possible for me, though, from platformers and shooters to adventure games, spreadsheet exercises and of course strategy games of all flavours.<br/><br/>It would be too lengthy to give even a short overview of relevant titles here, so I'll just namedrop some of my recent interests instead of listing the usual canon (of which I am a firm proponent; if you're interested in video games, play the classics). This winter I've been playing <i>Dino Run</i>, <i>Mega Man Unlimited</i>, <i>Zelda Classic</i> <i>Kingdom Rush</i>, <i>Civilization V</i>, <i>Katawa Shoujo</i>, <i>Fate Stay/Night</i> (a bit of an exploration of the form going on there), as well as the usual variety of random stuff. I'm also considering getting back to <i>Story of Eastern Wonderland</i> which I started exploring last summer, although I try to keep my video gaming casual at the moment. Impossible to predict what I'll be playing next, really, except that it won't be a heavy modern game with destructive immersion; I've too much work at hand to allow video games to take up too much time. I do fully intend to play some newer and more high-profile games once I finish my writing project; <i>Assassin's Creed</i>, that new Batman adventure game and some of the newer horror game descendants of <i>Alone in the Dark</i> have been in consideration, but the list is likely to evolve before I'll have the time to commit.<br/><br/>I've also watched live speedrunning this winter; an interesting phenomenon, that. It used to be that speedrun performances were honed carefully in private, while this live run scene cherishes an almost sports-like atmosphere.<br/><br/>Regarding theoretical interests, my recent notes about video game design continue explorations of procedurally generated content, emergent play, iterative game states and bold minimalism in transmission of story and theme - I'm historically heavy into rogue-likes, and enjoy applying the lessons of the genre to anything and everything. (Obviously I think highly of <i>Spelunky</i>, a delightful little game.)<br/><br/>The most important lesson that rpgs have to offer for video games (which I understood to be the question) is to my mind this: the act of play should be intentional, creatively ambitious, and personally constructive. RPGs by their nature are much more resistant to consumerism than video games, which makes for a base nature that video games should aspire to. What is the obvious baseline for rpgs is something that only conscious decision may afford in a video game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426615">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/StuMc" title="StuMc"><img alt="StuMc" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/StuMc">StuMc</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426615/#Comment_426615" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T18:26:31+00:00" title="January  4, 2014  6:26PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/><b>Fallout 3</b>:  This game almost made me want the Apocalypse to happen.  </blockquote>\nOMG!

Not only because I find playing with people more interesting, but also because I think the multiplayer format allows consumerism in a way that doesn't diminish the quality of the experience, at least in games where the holding company encourages community creativity and interaction (Team Fortress 2, since Valve is big into community generated content and modding) or there is a strong eSports/competitive scene (League of Legends, DotA 2, Counter-Strike) where money is focused on organizing tournaments and publicity rather than selling X number of copies of the game (especially so in LoL and DotA, since they're f2p).  Funnily enough, the three competitive games mentioned all evolved out of simple community mods and grew their communities over time into hugely important games in the international gaming community.<br/><br/>Aside from LoL and TF2 (which have eaten the most of my few precious video-game hours over the last 2-3 years), I've started playing Battlefield 4 as a social thing with some old schoolmates (friends can help mitigate bad design, but DICE need to get their ducks in a row with this catastrophe of a launch).<br/><br/>Single-player-wise I still play some story-heavy games, but prefer when those games offer more interesting choices within the context of a theme or narrative (The Witcher, Deus Ex).  I liked my time with Skyrim, but like all open-world games without a solid component that screams "I AM A GAME", world-sims kind of bore me.  The main quests are fun enough, but procedurally generated content to me is useless without a strong context for why I should care.  Some people I know have strong collector/completionist instincts, and they've gotten far more out of the crafting and other subsystems in TES than I did.  The gameplay (ie, fighting, navigating the gamespace) was also subpar, as with most Bethesda games, even if the exploration is neat at times.  If I had to describe Skyrim, I would have to borrow some uses of terms from Raph Koster and say that TES and its ilk use "delight" (ie, experiencing a novel situation or beautiful thing) over "fun" (the feeling you get from being challenged in a pure game context) to carry the burden of being entertaining.  The newer Fallouts carried me a little bit further because of the stronger writing, but eventually I got bored despite being a fan of that universe.<br/><br/>I'm also playing Umineko no Naku Kori Ni, which is a "sound novel", and literally just a book with sprites and music.  Not much interesting going on there except for the fact that they took a visual novel and eliminated any choice whatsoever, so I guess that's one way to experiment.  Persona 3 I'm about halfway through, and while I enjoy the aesthetic and the "Social Link" system for increasing combat prowess, it still carries all the sins of JRPGs and the Japanese design ethos.  Frustrated as I am with the Japanese video-game industry, I can't fault them for their artistic ability to do more with less in terms of aesthetics and graphic design.<br/><br/>So in terms of TTRPGs, I'd say emergence/unexpected things are good, but having a strong context can give those results more weight and add momentum.  In the same vein, don't let your lust for creating a pocket-universe look past things like accessibility and solid baseline design.<br/><br/>Overall, though, I think tabletop games have covered more ground than video-games when it comes to design, and I'd like to see more experimentation in video-games when it comes to creating systems that create emergent narrative or new and interesting ways to interact with other people (Journey comes to mind).  The digital games industry has hit a rut in the mainstream, and it's only within the last few years that we're seeing indie darlings pop up all over the place to force us to reconsider what's possible in that industry.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_426621">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ThoughtCheck" title="ThoughtCheck"><img alt="ThoughtCheck" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ThoughtCheck">ThoughtCheck</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426621/#Comment_426621" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-04T23:47:18+00:00" title="January  4, 2014 11:47PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><br/><b>Fallout 3</b>:  This game almost made me want the Apocalypse to happen.  </blockquote>\nOMG!

Among the great storytelling successes of NV: making all the possible factions seem both flawed and viable... even the obvious bad guys--the misogynistic, slave-holding, expansionist autocracy--was full of real people who could make coherent arguments about why they were the best choice for a harsh wasteland. <br/><br/>My favorite contribution, however, is in the four main expansions, and the way they use the same broad gameplay, make fairly minor mechanical or stylistic changes, and create vastly different play experiences; for instance, the area you explore in Dead Money makes you lose health while in outdoor areas. It's such a minor thing, but it heightens the tension throughout those early, outside quests, and turns a game which is naturally about cautious exploration into one which is about directed rushing punctuated by recovery periods. Similarly, Lonesome Road gives you a map with a single, well-guarded path, making exploration a non-issue and emphasizing the degree to which the player is being forced into a confrontation. The emotional heft of these expansions is very different from that of the main game (as with the other two, but I'm stopping myself before this turns into an essay), in part because of the story as it's presented to you, in dialog and description and visuals, but it part because the structure and mechanics of the game have been changed, in small but significant ways, from the baseline. <br/><br/>The lesson as I see it: the rules should re-enforce the narrative. In other words, you could call Dead Money a survival-horror experience in the Fallout universe, but if there were no constant threat--if you didn't need to compensate for your deteriorating health--it wouldn't actually work. I think there's plenty of awareness of this in the tabletop scene (look at the proliferation of apocalypse-powered games using relatively minor alterations to a ruleset to create very different stories) but it's worth staying mindful of... relatively small changes can create big, lasting effects.<br/><br/>(Also, consider the potential for changing the rules between sessions, or during a game, to make a certain place just FEEL different.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_426630">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus" title="The_Magus (Banned)"><img alt="The_Magus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/The_Magus">The_Magus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426630/#Comment_426630" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-05T15:28:38+00:00" title="January  5, 2014  3:28PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>OMG!

It's a turn-based tactical game where you get given thirty to forty units in total, but each one is effectively and economically characterised with varied and appealing backstories and personalities. Most of them grab you even in their typically brief introductions, and the fact that you can unlock more conversations with them by using them and having them grow closer to other members of the team gets you really invested in them.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_426716">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/426716/#Comment_426716" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-06T18:13:06+00:00" title="January  6, 2014  6:13PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Video games beat pick your own adventure books hands down but they use a lot of the logic of play - just with better graphics.

Chief among these is Armageddon Empires, which is a post-Apocalypse themed sort of card/board game synthesis, implementing some things which would be impossible in a physical board game.  Thing is though, becuase of the card nature of play - you have a hand of cards and pay resources to drop them on the hex map board - it therefore has a lot of colourful and evocative images - probably my favourite being a beached nuclear submarine emerging from a sea of sand dunes.  Also because of its card game nature, assembling a deck of cards to play, and the order in which they emerge, has an inherent tendency to create a kind of narrative.<br/><br/>Another interesting example is Crusader Kings, which is a strategy game that is all about people.  That ism, the character you play as, and their relatives, and children, are much more important factors in what is going on than stuff like moving armies about.  Also there are a whole series of random events to which characters must respond, and a whole specific set that are used when you raise your children and which informs the stats they will have when they grow up.  Becuase of the personal naturee of the whole thiing its too has an inherent tendency to create narratives of a sort.  Frex, there was the time I assasinated my father in law, because if he died now his daughter would inherit his lands, and thus they would come to me, while if he lived there were good odds he would would have more children, and if one of them was a son the inheritance would go to him.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_427026">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/427026/#Comment_427026" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-01-11T19:38:06+00:00" title="January 11, 2014  7:38PM">January 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I recently played <a href="http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/" rel="nofollow">a dark room</a> and really enjoyed it.
