What does that mean? I'm not sure. <br/><br/>It seems we have some cool things fall by the wayside because getting feedback is more difficult in our cornucopia of design. I got my ashcan into about 40 pairs of hands last year and getting feedback has been like pulling teeth. I want to help folks get encouraged, instead of discouraged. I want to try to work on helping folks with ashcans this year with a contest, which if it works out I'll run every year, till I don't. What kind of prize can I give to encourage folks to get off their duffs and find something interesting to give feedback on? What kind of criteria can I use to judge performance?

What kind of feedback can the designer provide? Should I try to get analog feedback from them or digital feedback? I.E. subjective feedback, or yes / no feedback? What kind of feedback would be a good determiner of quality?<br/><br/><b> Hey Boulet </b>,<br/>I think I haven't been clear, this isn't intended for my game, I would not be a part of the contest at all. This would be to help other designers. Although I have been thinking about how to use Theory From the Closet as a prize. Perhaps designer, and alpha gamer from the playtest group, talking about the game and the process of playtesting and feedback, what excited the alpha about the game, etc?<br/><br/><b>Hey Jesse</b>,<br/>I'm thinking I would get the most response to limit the time, perhaps to a month, otherwise folks tend to forget as time goes by and they have procrastination time. Do you think I'm wrong here? I also am wanting to try to help facilitate connections between designers and their possible audience, sort of like an extension of what the Ashcan Front did.<br/><br/><b>Hey Ccreitz</b>,<br/>I'm not sure exactly what you're saying. It seems to be that you're not motivated by the idea of a contest, because you already receive benefits from playtesting. If so, cool. I don't think everyone has had the same opportunities as you, and I'd like to encourage people to playtest, and hopefully get others to come to the same conclusion. That all being said, I want to keep this thread for comments for people who think the contest is a good idea, and want to help me brainstorm. I've already made my mind up to do it, so discussion of whether the idea has merit or not should be brought up in a new thread.

Rhoer</cite>It seems to be that you're not motivated by the idea of a contest, because you already receive benefits from playtesting</blockquote> It's not that I'm not motivated by the idea of a contest, but that the suggestions in this thread so far cover the entire space I could come up with \u2014 a beauty contest, basically. It's not clear to me how interesting that is.  Maybe it would be fun to add a rubric?  Like, a point for the best rewrite suggestion, a point for the funniest rules exploit, a point for the best writeup of mechanics 1...5 in play, a point for the report that makes the designer laugh, and a point for the one that makes him cry tears of hot, bitter shame?  That gives the playtesters a shot at getting better, too.<br/><br/>Let me go back one step, Clyde, on your IIEE: You say you've made up your mind to do a contest, to get people testing. Would it be too much of a rewrite to do an <i>event</i> instead, with the same goal in mind?  Like, a Playtesting Week, where participants get some cool reward as detailed in my original posting?  That would get some people out of the woodwork, I wager, on both sides.  As a designer, I have a game that's been tested once each internally and externally, and I'm just wrapping up a rewrite incorporating all the feedback.  I don't know how interested I'd be in freeform judging a contest, but I'd be less hesitant if I had a rubric to stick to, and even less hesitant if I knew it would cost me just the price of making up a dozen hard copies and mailing them to my testers, with a little "bonus" of some kind (or just mailing out the bonus, for that matter).  And as a playtester, I'd be psyched to participate in the greatest accumulation of AP reports we'll see all year, swapping stories with everyone else about the crazy, under-the-radar game I got to try out.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
