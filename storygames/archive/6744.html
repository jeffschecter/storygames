One of those good bits is of course dramatic economy and in-game rewards. Do a cool thing, get a point, then spend that point to make other cool things happen. I'm also encouraging players to bring their characters to a conclusion, playing them to narrative satisfaction then retiring them. A puzzle that comes up is those two ideas are a bit at odds. Unless the player wants to make a new character and return to playing within the same system, no in-game rewards have any relevance past the conclusion. <br/><br/>Its a minor issue, I admit, but an interesting one. How to reward players for ending the game satisfactorily, when ending the game by its nature invalidates all typical system-based rewards? I've even considered cash pools and gift certificates.

Run the story well, win tickets, trade them in at the booth for off-key radio-pens and misshapen teddy-bears stuffed with straw.\n<blockquote>The way to push people to invest in the <em>future</em> of the game is to start them with nothing (in a certain resource) and let them do cool things to earn more.<br><br>The way to push people to invest in the <em>end</em> of the game is to start them with something (in a certain resource) and let them do cool things by spending it down.<br/><br/>If you need both resources (the one you earn and the one you can only spend) together to do what you want then you'll have a rising-action flow:  You start out the game, do cool stuff to earn A-Tokens, then as you run low on B-Tokens you focus on using the last of those in a climactic manner, to get the most bang for your buck.<br/><br/>Make sense?</br></br></blockquote>\nA lot, thank you, that points out a concept I hadn't considered.

The trick would be calibrating the investment-worthy elements so that they encourage climax and resolution.If the players <i>want</i> to see things resolve satisfyingly, they'll be happy to move toward that. the reward system Tony postulated (which is pretty damn brilliant), would theoretically undergird that and bolster it.<br/><br/>Awhile back I talked to the players in my long-running Over the Edge game, which up till that point had meandered all over the damn place and drug on for years, about the idea of actually resolving everyone's character arcs and <i>ending</i> the game. This excited a lot of the players. One of them told me that the very <i>idea</i> of ending a campaign <b>on purpose</b>, and in some kind of creatively and emotionally satisfying way, was unheard of in our gaming and a tantalizing prospect. The principle element in this is that we started actually paying attention to what was written into the game in terms of individual setup (basically reading the chargen "why did you come to the island" question like a Kicker), and playing toward that. Instead of me deferring (often indefinitely) resolution of any part of the PC goal because I was scared shitless that I'd do it wrong or stupid. Now we're still working on a lot of old habits and game flow problems and stuff, but play is a lot better overall and we're actually moving toward a conclusion soon.<br/><br/>So I'd say the lesson there is to be clear on what you're moving toward. Have elements set up at the beginning of play that totally <i>scream</i> to be resolved. And then <i>resolve them</i>. make sure you actually pay off the players in their pursuit of closure, so that they know that this shit is for real supported and not just the typical RPG "backstory" bullshit (like Drawn Together's Xandir: "I'm on an endless quest to save my girlfriend!"). Trust your ability to offer up cool payoffs in the progression toward endgame, in whatever form those payoffs take in your particular game.<br/><br/>I'm not saying anything particularly new or brilliant for this community, but I'm trying to speak to my own experience and hope it's applicable.<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_150865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/150865/#Comment_150865" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-06-15T09:41:20+00:00" title="June 15, 2008  9:41AM">June 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It seems to me that one way to do this is to make getting what the player wants tied to the end of the character's story.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>If it is the last scene for your character, you get [big bonus] to all the stuff you do in that scene.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>There's something you really want for your character (like resolving their Kicker or something like that).
