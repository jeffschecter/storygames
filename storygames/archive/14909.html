The more ordinary the playset, the better, like \u201cA Nice, Southern Town.\u201d<br/>Each Old One rolls <b>2D6</b> to determine a <b>Relationship</b> (roughly determines how they fit within society, opposed to how they are connected with the other Mythos that may be playing), a <b>Need</b>, a <b>Location</b>, and an <b>Object</b>. Distribute one 1D6, 1D8, 1D10, and 1D12 among these, which are referred to as <b>Concerns</b>.<br/>Next, each Old One distributes one 1D4, two 1D6s, two 1D8s, one 1D10, and one 1D12 among the <b>Corruptions: Lust, Hunger, Greed, Sloth, Wrath, Envy,</b> and <b>Pride</b>.<br/>Each of the Old Ones\u2019 servitor-creations also has five points of <b>Vigor</b>, and five points of <b>Power</b>.<br/><br/>The Thing Man Was Not Meant to Know (or Keeper), will then describe the wretched existence the Old Ones\u2019 fleshy forms must endure \u2013 who they interact with on the train, the meetings they need to go to, the messy flesh-larvae they sire, the annoying co-worker they want to suck the brains out of, the commute to and from home, etc.<br/>When an Old One wishes its flesh-form to interact with the mundane world, it must <b>roll its most appropriate Corruption and Concern dice</b> (if it does not have an applicable Concern, it defaults to <b>1D4</b>).<br/><br/><b>Roll\tResult</b><br/>2-6\tProceed like an ordinary hooman.

Have coffee boil forth from your annoying co-worker\u2019s eyeballs. Use a Hound of Tindalos to staple your papers between the unseen dimensions. Have your car be raised like a palanquin by miserable, warped flesh-slaves to carry you to and from work. This still may involve failure and disappointment, but at least it\u2019ll be more impressive.

Maim, kill, drive things insane, cause tendrils of mutated flesh to burst from the earth below\u2026coffee filters be DAMNED. Lose a point of Vigor, but increase your Power by 2.<br/><br/>If your <b>Power ever reaches zero</b>, your flesh-form dies an ordinary, hooman death, whether from old age, high cholesterol, murdered by a street thug, etc. Make a new character.<br/>If your <b>Vigor ever reaches zero</b>, your flesh-form dies in some way considered deviant or disturbing by normal hoomans, like drinking cyanide-laced kool-aid with a UFO cult, misadventure involving high-voltage wires and a bathtub filled with a highly alkaline solution, or being fed to Dagon. Make a new character, but you get to instead distribute two 1D6s, two 1D8s, one 1D10, and one 1D12 among six total Concerns, and two 1D6s, two 1D8s, two 1D10s, and one 1D12 among the Corruptions.<br/>If your <b>Power ever reaches 13</b>, and you still have a bit of Vigor left over, your fleshy form becomes a powerful conduit for your will (probably a politician, cult leader, or television personality\u2026like Snooki).

In the meantime, with a couple of repurposed Fiasco playsets, I think this can be played as-is without any problem. So, I present, the revised version of <i>Outsiders</i>, that is now called (and EDITED...):<br/><br/><b>Companies &amp; Carpools</b><br/>Storytelling in the Banal World of Insignificant Humans\n<blockquote><b>Making Your Victim</b><br/>You and your fellow Old Ones, referred to throughout as Entities for short, will make feeble shells of flesh and bone to manipulate on the earthly plane, called Victims. These mortals cannot exist beyond time and space, and thus are limited in the scope of their abilities, both physically and mentally. The Entities will distribute polyhedrons of varying sizes among various facets of the Victim's frail existence, and through these abilities, control its actions and thoughts from Beyond Time and Space.<br/><br/><b>The Monograph</b><br/>Before the Entities make their Victims, the Keeper will decide on a Monograph, which provides the setting and flavor of its C&amp;C campaign. The Monograph provides lists of options, to serve both as terrible inspiration, as well as serving a vital purpose in creating Victims. Should no such Companies &amp; Carpools Monograph be available, the Keeper may make one of its own, or steal ideas from other games with a strong focus on the misery of human existence, such as <i>Fiasco</i> or <i>Chill</i>.<br/><br/><b>Roles</b><br/>Each Victim has a Role, its place within human society. A Role could take many forms, whether specific careers like an accountant or game designer, positions within a family like housewife or eldest son, or perhaps more dramatic terms like romantic protagonist or comedic foil. Roles have no mechanical effect, but should inform the actions the Entity makes its Victim perform. The Entity must roll a cyclopean D20 polyhedron to decide its Victim\u2019s Role.<br/><br/><b>Obscenities</b><br/>The basic capabilities, limitations, development, and corruption of a Victim is decided by its Obscenities. The Entities need to distribute one D4, three D6, two D8, and one D10 polyhedrons among the seven Obscenities. The greater number of sides, the more powerful, devious, vile, and terrifying the Victim will be...which makes perfect sense for the Great Old Ones and their unknowable power, but can be overwhelming and dangerous in mortal form.<br/><b>\u2022Apathy</b> \u2013 an unwillingness to put forth effort, feelings of detachment, uncaring<br/><b>\u2022Conceit</b> \u2013 deviousness, selfishness, egotism, and willingness to betray others<br/><b>\u2022Cunning</b> \u2013 duplicity, secrecy, toadying, bootlicking, and passing blame<br/><b>\u2022Greed</b> \u2013 miserliness and zealousness, possessive, inability to control gluttonous hunger<br/><b>\u2022Hatred</b> \u2013 anger and aggressiveness, prejudice, an inability to forgive or forget<br/><b>\u2022Lechery</b> \u2013 perversion, vulgarity, strong urges to copulate, fornicate, and molest<br/><b>\u2022Misery</b> \u2013 pain and emptiness, fear, loneliness, and a drive to share it with others<br/><br/><b>Obsessions</b><br/>Things that influence a Victim's decisions and actions are called Obsessions \u2013 those things they work themselves to death for, strive to obtain, or seek dearly to avoid. They may be so mundane as a photo of a girlfriend, individual as a custom-built luxury sports car, secret as a criminal record in a foreign country, or as deviant as an urge to sup on human flesh. The lives of mortals are full of surprises and twists, and even the Entities can never be certain what events will define the existence of its Victim.<br/>Entities must roll those terrible Euclidean D20s, and roll them thrice, and assign the results to one of each of the three Obsessions \u2013 Desires, Motives, and Secrets, and take note of their outcomes. Then they will distribute one D4, one D6, and one D8 polyhedral to each of their chosen options. As with Obscenities, assigning greater polyhedrons makes them more potent, but also that much more dangerous to mortals.<br/><b>\u2022Desires</b> \u2013 those ephemeral objects, dreams, and sensations the Victim dearly craves<br/><b>\u2022Motives</b> \u2013 the beliefs that the Victim holds dear, that direct its thoughts and controls its fate<br/><b>\u2022Secrets</b> \u2013 untoward knowledge, stolen information, valuables, evidence, and other things the Victim should not have<br/><br/><b>Offenses</b><br/>Finally, there are three conditions that can afflict a Victim, called Offenses. These represent unfortunate events, physical ailments, and derangement that can prevent a Victim from acting freely or as it desires. Offenses start without any assigned polyhedrons. Instead, when an Entity suffers a failed roll, it may have polyhedrons of specific sizes forced upon them as Offenses, with the Keeper describing the effects inflicted. If any Offense\u2019s rating increases beyond D12, the Victim will die.<br/><b>\u2022Madness</b> \u2013 erratic behavior and perceptions from fear, mental instability, stress, etc.<br/><b>\u2022Misfortune</b> \u2013 interference and complications from events such as arrest warrants, financial ruin, prejudice, etc.<br/><b>\u2022Mortality</b> \u2013 physical infirmity, caused by extreme age, overindulgence, blunt-force injury, acid, etc.<br/><br/><b>Doom</b><br/>As the Victim lives its blasted, ignorant life, wandering amongst the concrete architecture that surrounds humanity like grave markers, it may suffer defeats, deprivation, and damage. This is the true horror of the mundane world, for such things happen to these fleshlings through their own misadventure and foolishness! Entities never should feel that such results must stand \u2013 they have unfathomable, godlike power, after all! At any time, they can decide to let their Victim succeed anyway, using their supernatural influence to change results and alter events in the game to their liking (also referred to as \u201ccheating\u201d).<br/>Doing so will, however, upset the finely crafted adventures of the Keeper (better known as Nyarlathotep). To calm an Entity\u2019s irritability and impatience, the Keeper may offer a point of Doom to sate its unearthly hunger and avoid any cheating. These Doom points, when collected, can later be spent to improve the Entity\u2019s Victim \u2013 spending five Doom points will allow the Entity to reduce one of its Obscenities by one size, while either increasing another Obscenity by one size, or adding a new D4 Obsession and increasing an existing Obsession by one size (this allows the Keeper to preserve \u201cgame balance,\u201d or some other such Gug dung). Remember that lesser polyhedrons are good for Victims!<br/>It should be noted, however, that the Keeper has a limited of supply of Doom for every adventure \u2013 no more than 20 points. This is an important detail for later. Doom spent to advance a Victim is discarded for the rest of Eternity, and cannot be returned to the Keeper\u2019s allowance.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339237">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339237/#Comment_339237" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T10:35:15+00:00" title="August 17, 2011 10:35AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 17, 2011 10:36AM by stupidgremlin.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Doing Things</b><br/>When an Entity wishes its Victim to interact with the world and the tasty flesh-things that inhabit it, the Keeper may ask it to roll the polyhedrons from its most closely related Obscenities and Obsessions, as well as any Offenses that may interfere, totaling their results together. If the Victim does not have a related Obsession, and isn't suffering from an Offense, then it only rolls the polyhedral from Obscenity. The roll total determines whether the Victim\u2019s task was successful, and the Entity may then describe the effect of their action, successful or not, has upon the world.<br/><br/><b>Total\tResult</b><br/>1-5\t\t<b>Success!</b> The Victim performs as successfully as a flesh-creature can. Make the coffee. Collate and staple the reports. Drive the automotive transport. Consume that burrito. Describe in great detail how mundane and ordinary the task was.<br/>6-10\t\t<b>Failure!</b> A mistake occurs and failure results. The coffee is watered-down. The reports are not done in time. The parking space is already taken. Pants are stained with spilt burrito. Describe in great detail how mundane and ordinary the failure was.<br/>11-15\t<b>Fiasco!</b> By some terrible fluke, the Victim fails terribly. The coffee is spilled on someone. The reports are late and out of order. The Victim gets into a serious fender-bender before he gets to the parking lot. Experience indigestion and heartburn from a spicy burrito. Describe how irritating the failure was.<br/>16-20\t<b>Tragedy!</b> The Victim has caused some catastrophe through its incompetence or negligence. The coffee pot shatters spilling coffee over the CEO. The reports get erroneously sent to the wrong department, at a different company. The Victim's car runs over a small child pulling out of the driveway to get to work. Vomit on Nancy after eating a bad burrito and spend the next two hours in the lavatory. Describe how upsetting the failure was.<br/>21+\t\t<b>Disaster!</b> The Victim has set off a chain of events that will cause pain, injury, and suffering to itself and others. The coffee maker explodes, maiming the CEO. The reports contain incriminating information and are erroneously sent to a tabloid. The Victim's car causes a fifteen vehicle pileup on the highway during rush hour, killing eight people. Be the first to vomit and spend several hours in the lavatory in what turns out to be a massive food poisoning epidemic. Describe how horrendous the failure was.<br/><br/><b>Cheating</b><br/>As previously mentioned, Entities don't have to take the inept failures of their Victims lying down (or in some other supine position), and can choose to cheat, using their eldritch influences to change events in the game. Of course, doing so will earn the Entity the enmity of the Keeper (particularly if it ignores bribes of Doom points), and thus will have a profound effect on the fiction of the game. It is up to the Keeper to describe how the world, in turn, reacts to this sudden extradimensional presence. How do normal mortal humans react when someone explodes in front of the water cooler? Do paranormal investigators come to examine the remains of the dark servitors that sacrifice themselves to save the Victim a parking space? Does the cute girl from accounting give birth to frog-like spawn after she copulates with the Victim on the first date? Just because the power of the Entity allows the Victim to succeed, doesn\u2019t mean that it isn\u2019t noticed. Here are some examples.<br/><b>\u2022Failure:</b> The Entity influences probability or creates minor magical effects. The pot of coffee never seems to run out, as if an unseen secretary constantly refills it. The dreaded marketing meeting gets canceled when the CEO is hit by a speeding bicycle, saving the Victim from making a presentation. The annoying girl from three cubicles over who gossips too much goes quiet when she gets a call from her doctor informing her that she has esophageal cancer.<br/><b>\u2022Fiasco:</b> The Entity enables the success of its Victim through mental influences and minor magical rituals. Suddenly, everyone in the office loses their craving for coffee, and the coffee maker is thrown out. A Hound of Tindalos collates and staples the reports for the Victim, hiding in the unseen dimensions under its desk. The search for a parking spot is avoided by driving the car into an impossible angle in the garage, appearing in an open spot in the lot near the front doors.<br/><b>\u2022Tragedy:</b> The Entity uses its powers to bend the laws of time and space to pave its Victim's own way to success. Fill the boss' mug with hot Jamaican Roast coffee, boiling forth from an annoying co-worker's eye sockets. Get the Parker Account when a rival marketing firm sinks into the earth, never to be seen again. Have the Victim's automobile be raised like a palanquin by miserable, warped, flesh-slaves to carry it to and from work.<br/><b>\u2022Disaster:</b> The Entity can temporarily imbue its Victim with a portion of its terrible power, becoming its avatar upon the earth! Main, kill, destroy, turn people into pillars of salt, make hamsters explode, and cause tendrils of mutated flesh to burst from the bowels of the earth...all to refill the toilet paper dispenser in the mens\u2019 restroom.<br/><br/><b>Recovery and Death</b><br/>As the Victim suffers failure, it will sometimes also suffer Offenses for their trouble. Failing to stab that hipster may result in getting kicked in the reproductive organs, causing a D6 Mortality Offense. Getting captured by those Islamic extremists and being brainwashed might increase the Victim\u2019s Madness to D8. When an Offense grows larger than D12, the Victim will die as a result.<br/>The method and description of the death, however, depends on both the Offense and the conditions of the Victim's situation at the time. Mortality is most common, with deaths befitting any normal flesh-creature, whether from old age, high cholesterol, murdered by a street thug, etc. Madness will cause an extraordinary (and poetically satisfying) death, such as drinking a cyanide-laced fruit drink with a UFO suicide cult, misadventure involving high-voltage wires and a bathtub filled with a highly alkaline solution, or being fed as a sacrifice to Dagon. Misfortune will cause the Victim to die in some tragic, accidental way, whether boarding a plane with thousands of poisonous snakes hidden in the overhead luggage compartments, proudly but unwittingly declaring a membership with the Communist Party in a Texas bar filled with Tea Party Conservatives, or starving on the streets, homeless and alone after losing everything in the great Stock Market crash.<br/>Recovering from Offenses is never simple, and typically requires some esoteric, complex action, such as venturing into a disgustingly sterile clinic to receive medical treatment, speaking with someone about emotions and childhood traumas, or apologizing to insignificant flesh-creatures that felt wronged when used as tools and later discarded so the Victim could be promoted to a bureaucratic manager. Once such a task has been undertaken, the Entity can spend one of its collected Doom points to reduce the associated Offense by one size, which then is returned to the Keeper\u2019s Doom allowance.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_339238">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339238/#Comment_339238" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-17T10:39:01+00:00" title="August 17, 2011 10:39AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><b>Keeper\u2019s Role</b><br/>It is the duty of the Keeper to describe the wretched existence of the mundane world to the Entities as perceived and endured by their Victims, so that its Euclidean geometries and base understandings feel real and palpable: relate the sensation of being fondled on a crowded subway car; detail the ponderous process of how mortals gain sustenance from the consumption of vulgar animal flesh and vegetable matter, only to recycle it and excrete it later; imitate the wails of the human acts of copulation, and the wails of the horrible little larval spawn that must be tended afterward; expound on the torture of interacting with other inane humans, both within their havens and dens of suffering (remember to refer to it as an \u201coffice\u201d), while resisting the urge to devour their brains; ask them how they react to the meaningless dreaming cycles their Victims must enter every lunar rotation, and so on! The excitement!<br/><br/><b>Signs of the Keeper</b><br/>While all of the action revolves around the Entities and their Victims, the Keeper does have important rituals of its own, allowing its terrible will to become manifest in the world. These are referred to as Signs. Similar to the actions a Victim might take, the Keeper can reveal a Sign of its presence whenever the Victims fail in their actions, ignore potential threats or complications, or as a warning of its cosmic displeasure!<br/><b>\u2022Impede Them</b> with obstacles, stuck elevators, traffic jams, glass ceilings<br/><b>\u2022Confront Them</b> with inconvenient truths, a \u201ctalk\u201d with the boss, consequences of their decisions, pregnancy tests<br/><b>\u2022Imply Future Problems</b> such as strange smells from the kitchen, increased e-mail spam, drops in the stock market<br/><b>\u2022Announce Immediate Problems</b> like sludge spewing forth from the sink, smoke rising from the car engine, a pink slip<br/><b>\u2022Take Things Away</b> like towing their car, revoking smoke break privileges, stealing their wallet<br/><b>\u2022Call in Debts</b> such as getting a visit from \u201cVinnie,\u201d being guilt-tripped into bailing your brother out of jail<br/><b>\u2022Require Investment</b> like spending $150 on a hospital co-pay, replacing the brakes on the car, settling that outstanding phone bill<br/><b>\u2022Inconvenience Them</b> with a visit from Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, intestinal distress, head lice<br/><b>\u2022Cockblock Them</b> by stealing their date, cheating on them, revealing the secret ending of their favorite show<br/><b>\u2022Offer Crappy Choices</b> like going to Juarez or Algeria for vacation, getting laid of or being transferred to the branch in Moosehat<br/><b>\u2022Offer Great Choices</b> with terrible strings attached that they don\u2019t know about<br/><b>\u2022Provoke Them</b> with a fight at the pub, promoting a slacker employee to become their supervisor<br/><b>\u2022Hide Something</b> like the remote control, their keys, the report they need to deliver to the boss<br/><b>\u2022Rearrange Things</b> so they can\u2019t find anything<br/><b>\u2022Impose Judgment</b> of their friends, peers, bosses, the public at large, the law<br/><b>\u2022Inflict an Offense</b>, typically 1D4 for Failures, 1D6 for Fiascos, 1D8 for Tragedies, and 1D10 for Disasters<br/><b>\u2022Exacerbate an Offense</b>, increasing it by one size for Failures, two for Fiascos, three for Tragedies, and four for Disasters<br/><br/><b>Ending the Game</b><br/>Should any Entity have at least ten unspent Doom points when their Victim dies, the game ends when it gets frustrated with the inane rules and unrealistically lethal mundane fictional world, and storms off to play some video games instead. If the Keeper runs out of Doom points in its allowance, the game ends with the Keeper getting fed up with the Entities constantly cheating and blatantly ignoring the rules, and hastily summarized the rest of their Victims\u2019 lives. Should any of the Victims have at least three Obscenities rated at D4, they will be declared de facto winner of the game, becoming some kind of celebrity, politician, or mega-church cult leader.</blockquote> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_339497">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin" title="stupidgremlin"><img alt="stupidgremlin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/097/7/0/Goblin_Small_Icon_by_gremlinlegions.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stupidgremlin">stupidgremlin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/339497/#Comment_339497" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-18T12:52:04+00:00" title="August 18, 2011 12:52PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 18, 2011 1:07PM by stupidgremlin.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's the first Monograph for Companies &amp; Carpools:<br/><b>Fields of Blood and Iron</b><br/>A World War Monograph<br/><b><br/>Roll  |  Roles  |  Desires  |  Motives  |  Secrets</b><br/>1  |  Assassin  |  Addicted to Power  |  Atone for future transgressions  |  A murder of passion<br/>2  |  Chaplin  |  Chain Smoking  |  Atone for past mistakes  |  A whispered confession<br/>3  |  Commando  |  Drunkard  |  Foreign women are agents of the devil  |  Blackmail against the commander<br/>4  |  Field Medic  |  Enemy Memorabilia  |  Foreign women are the sexiest  |  Counterfeit foreign currency<br/>5  |  Fighter Pilot  |  Explosives  |  Get revenge on your platoon  |  Enemy code book<br/>6  |  Infantryman  |  Fine Art  |  It\u2019s all HIS fault\u2026  |  Enemy propaganda<br/>7  |  Marine  |  Freedom  |  It\u2019s all your fault  |  Evidence of wartime atrocities<br/>8  |  Mess Cook  |  Gambling  |  It\u2019s none of their business\u2026  |  Forged passport and travel documents<br/>9  |  Military Liason  |  Kleptomania  |  It\u2019s not your fault  |  Gambling debts<br/>10  |  Mechanic  |  Masochism  |  Join the enemy  |  Lead-lined cannister of plutonium<br/>11  |  Prisoner of War  |  Morphine Addiction  |  My true love must be out there  |  Letter from an enemy spy<br/>12  |  Radio Operator  |  Pornography  |  Spread propaganda  |  Lewd photo of your best friend<br/>13  |  Saboteur  |  Promotion  |  Spread the faith  |  Lewd photo of your best friend\u2019s girlfriend<br/>14  |  Sailor  |  Pyromania  |  Spread venereal disease  |  Lewd photo of your girlfriend<br/>15  |  Sergeant  |  Sadism  |  The Commander has wronged you  |  Map leading to a stash of stolen gold<br/>16  |  Sniper  |  Sodomy  |  The enemy must die!  |  Promise from a P.O.W.<br/>17  |  Spy  |  Taste of Blood  |  The locals are out to get you  |  Secret enemy agent<br/>18  |  Supply Clerk  |  Taste of Flesh  |  Their lives are not worth sparing  |  Subversive beliefs<br/>19  |  Tank Commander  |  War Trophies  |  Why aren\u2019t YOU in command?
