Ok well I've actually played Tremulus, and I play a lot of CoC, and although I haven't played any other *World games I'm familiar with the way they work having talked to lots of peeps who have. So here's my two penn'orth. A guy I know who's also played a lot of CoC and has played lots of *World says that AW really eats up story, as you end up getting a lot of clues, which is bad if you've got a really dark, intense game of Cthulhu you want to take your time over. I'd add to that that the triggering of moves, with all that that entails in terms of negotiating outcomes with the GM, especially on 7-9 rolls, reduces the tension considerably. Having said that, it's up to the GM how much to let that interfere, and I enjoyed the game in general, but I'm not sure I'm totally persuaded that overall AW is a good fit for Cthulhu.                           </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Scott" title="Scott"><img alt="Scott" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/641/nQSLLSAQTIZ2E.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Scott">Scott</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414175/#Comment_414175" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T11:14:05+00:00" title="May 16, 2013 11:14AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The print version of Tremulus is not out to backers of the KS yet.

Some of the best CoC games I ran back in college played a lot like what I've read about the world games. Presenting the players a scene and giving them horrible decisions to make. I got my players to the point where they didn't want to make their "spot hidden" rolls. But the tension is often from not going directly into the jaws of death but instead dancing around it becoming slowly aware of how much danger you are in.  <br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg" title="semajmaharg"><img alt="semajmaharg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/482/n0TRVVHW3SOVY.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/semajmaharg">semajmaharg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414193/#Comment_414193" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T17:01:42+00:00" title="May 16, 2013  5:01PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is an AW Cthulhu game either possible or desirable?

AW is a quick and dirty system; Cthulhu, at least in its purest form, is all about restraint and creeping dread.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm wrong and AW could be hacked to achieve that, but thinking through what changes would have to be made to make it work is at least worth considering in some depth.

And Call of Cthulhu is just like old school D&amp;D except you're exploring unfamiliar relationships instead of locations (and even then, some of the earliest adventures are straight dungeon crawls), so I mean, I could run it. Granted, I've played more CoC in my life than any other game, and I could run it without the rules, so that could be why subbing in AW doesn't seem that hard from my perspective.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414202">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414202/#Comment_414202" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-16T18:58:08+00:00" title="May 16, 2013  6:58PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2013 7:00PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The main thing I think that works in translation from Lovecraft to AW is Fronts, or their equivalent.

I guess I don't see that as a necessity in any AW hack.

Claiming that CoC is a good system for generating horror is like saying D&amp;D's alignment system (as presented, not as drifted) is a good system for generating subtle morality-focused dramatic roleplay. It just isn't.<br/><br/>All that the CoC system is good for is churning out fragile, incompetent, non-heroes that you can throw at your menace. The only thing it does well is generate a high likelihood of failure in your attempted actions. It makes the game like a scary dream where you can't run fast enough to get away or fight hard enough to hurt anyone. It generates the feeling of helplessness rather than competence in the face of threat.<br/><br/>And that's not nothing. That's kind of useful for a horror game. But it's not much.<br/><br/>But the system itself doesn't do anything else useful. It doesn't help you pace an investigation effectively (where pacing is more important than success/failure). It doesn't help generate juicy moral dilemmas. It doesn't help generate things your character holds dear so that the GM can destroy them.<br/><br/>GMs can do those things. Good ones learn tricks and techniques to do so. But the system doesn't inherently do any of those things well. The only thing it does well is generate that moment when you trip and fall while the monster is chasing you, or the moment where you fire a shotgun at the beast and it doesn't work and the thing keeps coming.<br/><br/>So I think when people say "It's not Cthulhu" what they mean is "the things embedded in the system are different from the things I spent years figuring out how to do outside of the other system, because so little useful stuff was embedded in it."<br/><br/>People say the same thing when they look at a D&amp;D-like system that attempts to do something with social interaction, which the old D&amp;D systems gave pretty much zero system feedback on. So people made up their own way to deal with it. So when someone embedded another way, they said "that's not D&amp;D".<br/><br/>If you have a horror game system that tries to do anything other than make you feel fragile and helpless and incompetent, then it's trying to do more than CoC does, so it's not going to feel like CoC. If you drifted/hacked CoC to work for you, then what you did is going to feel different from what someone else tries to embed into a new system.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414246">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414246/#Comment_414246" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-17T10:18:36+00:00" title="May 17, 2013 10:18AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fronts are certainly a good way of advancing the Lovecraft feel, and as has been pointed out earlier--it's about a scarcity of sanity.

It is certainly the reason 13-year-old Johnstone decided to ditch Palladium and AD&amp;D 2e and make CoC his primary rpg. This is also the source of all horror in the old school D&amp;D games I play, which can be pretty terrifying from the perspective of the PCs.<br/><br/>I more or less agree with the other shortcomings of CoC mentioned here, BUT I consider the adventures, and the heavy usage of pre-written adventures in general, a fundamental part of the game.

I have some acquaintances that overly enshrine CoC as a game, so I was airing a bit of frustration over that.<br/><br/>But it also comes from the fact that every time I played the quality of the game came pretty much entirely from the GM's skill at crafting and delivering an intriguing adventure, rather than from anything in the system itself (other than the fragility and lack of competence).<br/><br/>I played with really good GMs. They wrote their own stuff. It was awesome.<br/><br/>But nothing about the experience felt reproducible. I never left feeling like if I ran the game for some other friends that I could make the same sort of magic happen. I read the rulebook and it had extremely little in it that made me feel like I could run the game well.<br/><br/>But when I look at something like Dungeon World, I look at the moves and the principles and all that, and I can easily see how I can run the game like Hamish did when I played it with him at con, which was also awesome. Because so much of the good stuff that happened is based on what the book tells you to do.<br/><br/>So I want a Cthulhu game that does more of that.<br/><br/>I don't know if tremulus is it, though. I started reading it and it didn't grab me nearly as much as DW did. But it looked like it was going to try to do a lot more than just generate underpowered characters and hope that you craft or buy a good scenario to run them through.<br/><br/>Tried Trail of Cthulhu as well and had a horrible experience. Not sure how much of that was the system's fault and how much was a bad GM. The system looked like it was trying to do something, but it fell flat at the table. I could tell that some of the fault was the GM not getting it. I'd try it again with a GM I knew and trusted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414267/#Comment_414267" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-17T20:51:42+00:00" title="May 17, 2013  8:51PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For sure, I'm with you.

I apparently love CoC more than RobMcDiarmid des, but even I think that there are things in the game could use a bit of improvement or clarification.<br/><br/>More fairly, I tend to think that, like D&amp;D, there are really several main forms or approaches to CoC that are popular that have developed out of CoC.<br/><br/>For me, Graham's Cthulhu Dark nails one of those popular strains of CoC very well. ToC does a pretty good job of another one.<br/><br/>The fragility/incompetence thing is I suspect, less of an actual thought out design decision in CoC, and more of an example of simply following trends set down by the highly successfully D&amp;D game, combined with an urge to a certain flavor of simulation ( in the form of the vast skill list). <br/><br/>Simply put, even CoC was influenced by the D&amp;D concept of going from Zero to Hero over time, and that might not actually be all that great of a fit for certain kinds of CoC. <br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414284">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/revel911" title="revel911"><img alt="revel911" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/revel911">revel911</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414284/#Comment_414284" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-18T06:41:45+00:00" title="May 18, 2013  6:41AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Just to catch that stray reference, the guy who was doing a Kult hack a while back is still working on it.<br/><a href="http://kult-illusionen.blogspot.se/" rel="nofollow">Here's a link</a> to a production blog which I guess you could try to google translate if you want to.

I feel like a lot of the consensus on tremulus hate is potentially a bit of mob mentality.<br/><br/>I remember being completely blindsided when the game got kickstarted. SGers were all upset and wary of the game, because all other AW hacks (that we'd heard of) had been developed more or less completely in the open, and are (probably correctly) thought to have been better games for it.<br/><br/>Along comes tremulus, developed outside that community entirely, and we all get mixed feelings about it. We dislike that a game made by one of our own is being hacked by an outsider (albeit with permission) and sold as a new game. We look at the character sheets and see that the basic moves and stats are relatively unchanged, which makes us look sideways, since conventional wisdom has it that stats and basic moves are *how* you hack AW into some other genre.<br/><br/>Fast forward to now, and a very simple question is asked about whether there are any cthulhu/horror AW games published. And now we have people giving a bunch of potentially unwarranted opinions and suggestions of games out of that scope, and we've managed to muddy the thread up quite a bit.<br/><br/>TL;DR Yeah, there's an AW hack called tremulus that's made for Cthulhu horror, but I haven't played it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/catty_big" title="catty_big"><img alt="catty_big" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/972/nXE8MBTJJYQWO.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/catty_big">catty_big</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414295/#Comment_414295" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-18T15:27:10+00:00" title="May 18, 2013  3:27PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 27, 2013 8:33AM by catty_big.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote>I only vaguely looked at tremulus, but where are people feeling that it particularly falls down?</blockquote>\n*World rules both speed up the game too much- in the sense of eating up plot by providing too many clues etc- and slow it down, in the sense that the constant triggering of moves means that the players get all tangled up in the MC/Player negotiations. IMO these factors have an impact on the tension and slow build-up which is not devasting but significant. I still think Teremulus is a great game, it's just not Cthulhu.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nInteresting. Can you give me an example when the other one happened in a game. I'm trying to imagine the negotiation part you talked about and how that impacts things.<br/><br/></blockquote>\nSure. Mind, it\u2019s been a while since I played it, and I haven\u2019t played any other *World games- although I feel I have via osmosis- but I\u2019ve played a fair amount of CoC. First of all, I wasn\u2019t very clear earlier. When I talked about negotiation, I was referring to the interaction between the player and the system, as administered and adjudicated on by the GM. Ok, say you\u2019re in the Library, looking for a grimoire or something that\u2019s not likely to be immediately apparent. BRP: The GM asks you to make a spot hidden roll. You have a stat of 50, you roll 45.  So the GM narrates that you find what appears to be the object you\u2019re looking for, but you\u2019re not 100% certain etc. All of which takes about ten seconds. AW: GM says \u2018Ok that will be a Detect Hidden Object Move.\u2019 (I\u2019m guessing here- I can\u2019t lay hands on the character sheet from that game). You roll 9. The GM gives you the choice of:<br/><br/>1. Ask for a clue (What\u2019s the object\u2019s significance?)  <br/>2. a) You find the object but\u2026 you will need to come back to study it properly.<br/>2. b) You find the object but\u2026 as you pick it up you suddenly feel (dizzy/nauseous etc).<br/>3. You find the book, pick it up, and go to walk out of the room, but\u2026 just then the butler enters the room.<br/>All of which takes a few minutes, but it\u2019s not just the time taken, it\u2019s also the fact that when presented with a set of choices most players, like most consumers, will vacillate (I know I do). And that for me is what reduces the tension. <br/><br/>Also, AW rules are designed to provoke and handle emotionally-charged interactions between the characters*: strings and fronts etc. wouldn\u2019t work with Cthulhu I feel because it\u2019s simply not that kind of game. Having said that, it was my first exposure to an AW hack and as such I was impressed with the mechanics in themselves, and following it I now want to try other *World games. I particularly like the fact that something always happens. It\u2019s become commonplace now to talk about \u2018yes but\u2019 systems, and how they obviate whiffing and so forth- I actually think almost all systems should incorporate an element of \u2018yes but\u2019- but this wisdom is comparatively recent, when AW first came out that concept was still quite radical.<br/><br/>*Happy to be corrected if this isn't the case.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414302">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414302/#Comment_414302" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-18T18:30:39+00:00" title="May 18, 2013  6:30PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Slowing down the speed of revelation is still up to the GM because they decide what they reveal, how fast they let things out.

It's not too bad, but you can see where it's painted over some of the AW parts. <br/><br/>Personally I don't have a good handle on some of the Stats (I always confuse Affinity and Passion), and I don't always remember what each one is used for. I did initially think that all the Basic Moves were just reskinned AW moves, but they don't always map precisely.<br/> * Threaten = Go Aggro (Might)<br/> * Resort to Violence = Seize by Force (Might)<br/> * Act Under Pressure = Act Under Fire (Reason)<br/> * Convince = Seduce or Manipulate (Affinity)<br/> * Read a Person = Read a Person (Passion)<br/> * Puzzle Things Out = Read a Situation (Reason)<br/> * Poke Around = Open Your Brain (Luck), but you tend to find clues and objects rather than provoke psychic weirdness.<br/><br/>I actually don't mind the collaborative clue-finding stuff, since I need to drop plenty of information on the players so they stand a chance of figuring out what's going on - then the real challenge is figuring out what to do about it! And if they decide to make up something that leads them in an unexpected direction, then we've just made the story together. I haven't had a lot of that come up yet, but I think that the players sharing their worst fears and theories with you, and you all getting to decide which are true, will lead to potentially better stories than if the Keeper sticks religiously to their prep material.<br/><br/>Speaking of prep, the Playsets tremulus offers are an easy way to make initial situations; it gives the players a choice of the sort of content they want to see, and then directs the GM to a couple of paragraphs (some public, some hidden) they can use as inspiration to create the setting. Generally you'll end up with two "threads" which can be woven together to create an even more complex situation.<br/><br/>Sanity is handled pretty much the same way damage is. You have two Damage gauges - Health and Sanity. Health gets worse as you take Harm, and Sanity gets worse as you take Shock. There's a "Sanity Check" move using Reason (another reason it's a super-stat), and a separate Shock Damage move which I don't like much - it doesn't give you any options, just one result for each of 10+/7-9/6-. You can take insanities to stop yourself from becoming unplayable, the same way you can take physical debilities to prevent harm from killing you.<br/><br/>I've started a series of actual play blog posts <a href="http://powerframe-rpg.blogspot.com.au/2013/04/ebon-eaves-prelude.html" rel="nofollow">here</a>. We're still getting to grips with the system; in particular, I'm finding it difficult to engage the gears when the investigators are in town, because they aren't being too proactive yet, and the town is full of weird people who won't go out of their way to talk about the town's dark past. I really need to step up my game and redress that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414351">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/3Jane" title="3Jane"><img alt="3Jane" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/3Jane">3Jane</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414351/#Comment_414351" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T02:32:45+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  2:32AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 20, 2013 2:33AM by 3Jane.">edited May 2013</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Oh and sanity is always, always about scarcity. </blockquote>\nCould you please expand on that? I'm trying to understand why people like it and what they use it for. It was added to tremulus on top of the AW framework, so I'm assuming there's a reason for it being there. However, whenever I played CoC and ToC I found sanity boring/frustrating, not scary. I also ran the tremulus demo adventure twice, and the whole sanity procedure was rather breaking the mood (roll +Reason to find out if your sanity loss is not as bad and if you can act, then roll +shock suffered, then - if the creature physically attacked you - roll +damage suffered) so I started treating it as optional, even though it isn't (I don't think there are any optional rules in tremulus). (It also felt futile - I dislike showing "big" monsters, so anything the players would encounter only had a small sanity loss which was usually negated by the first +Reason roll).<br/><br/>TLDR:

I'm trying to understand why people like it and what they use it for. It was added to tremulus on top of the AW framework, so I'm assuming there's a reason for it being there. However, whenever I played CoC and ToC I found sanity boring/frustrating, not scary.</blockquote>\nI love sanity rules because they are a way to show the players that they are on to something and that something id terribly wrong without having to give too much away. So you are reading from a book and I say "As you read something is nagging at the back of your head. The pages are somehow wrong. Lose one sanity." In CoC sanity is on a hundred point scale so one point is insignificant but it still hurts and players take note. In World game terms it would be dealing damage. I think best done without a roll. You're right - once things get mechanical (especially if used too often) it loses it's significance. <br/><br/>I could see asking for a narrative of how you cope with the weirdness as an unobtrusive way of finding out if you lose more sanity. Years ago I did a game where players tracked what their mind set was. One player (a scout) was totally open to the sensations of the world. They opened a door - I looked at their cognitive pyramid - and say "Something hits you in the face. You fall back reeling and throw up. Another player had the mind set "They're all hunks of meat" so when he looked in he saw the massacre - because they were all hunks of meat so so what? <br/><br/>It is the always stay with the narrative parts of the World games that I think could work the best with Cthulhu Horror. It is going to rely on a lot of GM skill though. <br/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414386">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/lumpley" title="lumpley"><img alt="lumpley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/lumpley">lumpley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414386/#Comment_414386" name="Item_53" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T11:18:06+00:00" title="May 20, 2013 11:18AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "I love sanity rules because they are a way to show the players that they are on to something and that something id terribly wrong without having to give too much away."<br/><br/>Wha...!<br/><br/>That is great!<br/><br/>Huh!<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414392">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414392/#Comment_414392" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-20T13:22:56+00:00" title="May 20, 2013  1:22PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, countdown timers are bomb like that.<br/><br/>Sometimes, you don't even know what it is yet, you just set the timer.

Is that why I've never been able to use any of the published adventures, because they just didn't strike me as scary? Was CoC simply never meant to do that? I bought CoC as a Lovecraft fan, not because I was introduced to it by other players. Then I ditched it and ran horror stuff mostly diceless. I never actually managed to have someone else run it for me until very recently so I had no clue about the culture surrounding it. Please tell me more!<br/><br/>Also, does a system exist that was written with the intent of scaring the players? (For context: I don't care for modern horror films - slashers, gore, killing off the characters one by one, cheap scares like "something jumps out at you from behind the corner aahhhhh". I prefer Lovecraft, Machen, Blackwood. Weird fiction, I suppose.)<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Graham">@Graham</a>: is there any adventure that you would recommend as a good starter/demo for Cthulhu Dark? Perhaps one of your Purist adventures?\n<blockquote>I love sanity rules because they are a way to show the players that they are on to something and that something id terribly wrong without having to give too much away. So you are reading from a book and I say "As you read something is nagging at the back of your head. The pages are somehow wrong. Lose one sanity."</blockquote>\nThanks! This makes sense. If I understand you correctly, sanity is a mechanism to point the players towards plot-significant details in the general sea of weirdness, so that they don't get fixated on something that was simply supposed to be a creepy throwaway detail. This makes sense in Call of Cthulhu and Trail of Cthulhu, where you have a mystery which the players are discovering/solving, so they need to be pointed towards it. I'm not sure if it makes sense in tremulus, since the AW framework can let the players push the game in a completely different direction.<br/><br/>I suppose what worries me about this concept is dividing fiction into "stuff that has consequences" and "stuff that has no consequences, just colour, therefore can be safely ignored". Using a HP analogy: when the GM says "and you get horribly slashed, take 10 HP damage", the horrible slash is just colour. When the fight is over, the player can then describe their character as going about their business as usual, instead of sitting in a corner, incapacitated with wound-induced shock. Likewise, sanity only has game-changing consequences (mental disorders) once you lose enough of it.<br/><br/>I tend to do this narratively, sprinkle a lot of appropriate details and have the players add two and two in their heads. But then I don't usually have a fully pre-planned mystery with pre-planned, limited clues that the players need to be led towards.

What I meant by Sanity is about scarcity, is the allegory with AW's basics of survival. You need your sanity in order to confront and comprehend the mythos. It is an anti-status quo. It is the lack of by which you terrify the players, not in mechanical effects, but narrative weight.\n<blockquote>This story may well be a quieter one, focused on small details and continual revelations of weirdness, until you find the characters caught up in inexorable events and circumstances spiraling out of control. A thump in the basement or a rat in the wall can be every bit as terrifying as a cultist in a clearing (unless said cultist also runs the boarding house you stay in). Remember: you\u2019re creating and telling human stories with inhuman elements.</blockquote> p.3<br/><br/>I rarely use the 'sanity check' as described on p.116, I use the standard <b><i>act under pressure</i></b> roll and follow the guidelines there.  I ALWAYS make a hard move on a miss, always. Irrevocable narrative consequences that are frightening and disturbing, if not directly to the character then to those they hold dear. I use black stones for tracking sanity and <b><i>give</i></b> them to the players (rather than take them away) as they accrue sanity loss. One they usurp their quota... madness ensues.<br/><br/>With descriptions I follow Graham's advice and avoid Lovecraftian cliche's, take my time and collaborate fictionally with the players to unsettle of imaginations. We focus tightly on the details: individual, isolated elements, giving tantalising glimpses rather than the full 'overview' of the scene / monster / terror. Leave oddly specific, unexplained references for you to unravel later as the horror unfolds. <br/><br/>I am a strong believer in Mr. Walmsley's adage that the 'mythos are creepiest when being nice'. A horrifc benelovance. The players will feel a strong sense of disquiet when instead of having a -1 forward to the next roll, you give them a handful of black sanity stones and the Elder things want to learn from them, or the Deep One hybrids welcome them into their hotel, or the culties are eager to share secrets.<br/><br/>And remember, in lovecraft, although supernatural certainty and reprisals increase throughout the story, no-one dies until the end. Thus although the investigators have seen things beyond human understanding, all un-ambiguous evidence of supernatural activity is destroyed, meaning that no-body will believe them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414434">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414434/#Comment_414434" name="Item_67" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-21T05:51:11+00:00" title="May 21, 2013  5:51AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            3Jane:<br/>The way I was introduced to, or at least prepped for, CoC was the same way I was prepped for D&amp;D: through a magazine article I read about it after seeing an advertisement for it ( also in print format). In the case of CoC, it was in an issue of Twilight Zone magazine, and the writer was a cartoonist named Gahan Wilson.<br/><br/>He talked about it as a <b>horror-themed adventure game</b>. I'd never actually read any HPL at that point. He basically described the rub of the HPL-verse and talked about actual game play, three very different approaches with three different game groups.<br/><br/>Here's what I came away with: It was D&amp;D crossed with the Gangbusters setting, and the monsters were these cosmic horrors and their minions. The PCs were talented normal humans with an emphasis on brainy academic types, with the occasional Interwar Era tough guy thrown into the mix. You had 2 kinds of hit points, physical ( very few, but recoverable) and mental ( more, but you needed to risk those regularly to succeed at the adventure or use magic, and losing lots at once had some side effects beyond just them lowering.)<br/><br/>Okay, and maybe a little Indiana Jones thrown in for good measure. And maybe some Scooby-Doo, except the monsters were real, not guys in rubber masks.<br/><br/>Instead of a dungeon, you had a mystery to navigate, mostly through research in libraries and archives, and in small site locations. You weren't going into it to grab gold pieces, you were going to solve the mystery ( pretty much just like you might take an adventure in D&amp;D to save the princess).<br/><br/>See that's the mindset I came in with. Honestly, it has never seemed to let me down.<br/><br/>Again, I'm happy t get together with folks who want chills and creepiness and I'll do my best to get that in there, whether as GM or character player.<br/><br/>But I don't really worry too much if the players are never truly skeered or appalled at their characters' minds being opened to the truth of the awfulness of the universe.<br/><br/>Which is expected I guess, since I never found HPL's stories all that scary ( except Pickman's Model and the one about the guy trapped in a cabin with an illiterate cannibal and his favorite picture book). I consider them more a peculiar form of SF.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_414442">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem" title="CarpeGuitarrem"><img alt="CarpeGuitarrem" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/CarpeGuitarrem">CarpeGuitarrem</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414442/#Comment_414442" name="Item_68" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-21T07:07:21+00:00" title="May 21, 2013  7:07AM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The talk of CoC as an adventure game <a href="http://thekitchensink123.blogspot.com/2012/01/call-of-cthulhu-review-of-sorts.html" rel="nofollow">reminds me of this...</a><br/><br/>Anyhow--really cool thoughts on how SAN loss is a flag.

Another view is that symptoms are coping mechanisms/behaviors that people consciously (BF Skinner) or unconsciously (Freud) pick to keep it together. I'd see a World game mechanic fitting the Behaviorist model where a move give coping options that are described in the narrative.

You're like, "no way I'm gonna talk. I taunt him instead, I tell him I slept with his wife." I say, okay, roll to resist pressure, because he's beating you up and all that.<br/>* You roll and get a miss: He breaks you, you spill the beans. Sorry chum.<br/>* You roll and get a 7-11, you can choose either to not spill or get under Vichaud's skin. Let's say he believes you about his wife, now you (probably) have an advantage over him. Yeah, he got the goods out of you, but the whole power dynamic just changed and he's the one trapped in the cell (mentally).<br/>* Or you roll a 12+ and you get both, and you may be beat up but you have all the social power now.<br/><br/>Or, there's the emotional pressure. Like, say you encountered the eel-like minions of the terraforming storm and developed an intense fear of them. Just seeing pictures of them will give you panic attacks. So when they attack again, what do you do? Go into a panic attack, or resist the pressure?<br/>* If they haven't got you yet, all you need is a 7+ so you can resist an internal pressure (the panic)--although if you roll a 7-9, you freeze, which might have consequences.<br/>* But what if they've already got a hold of you? Their paralytic, anaesthetic touch counts as an external pressure. If you resist it, you can still take action. If you reverse it, you can harm the eels in some fashion. And if you resist the panic you can stay calm and rational and not suffer more stress (from the panic, that is, you might still get stressed from the eel attack). But you can't have all three.<br/><br/>Or, to go back to the first example, let's say you had a psychic vampire parasite living inside your body and it was going to crawl into Vichaud's mind and you really, really don't want that to happen, no matter how much of a jerk he is. That's an internal pressure you need to resist. At that point, you probably don't care about turning the tables on him, either.<br/><br/>(So it's like the passive act under fire, as opposed to the do something dangerous move or evade, which are both active.)<br/><br/>The basic ideas in the harm, stress, and reaction rules are good, but I need to clean them up a bunch. Like making the death-countdown a courtesy only, so when you take harm it's the wound that counts and the number next to it is just an indicator of how close to mechanical death you are, but you can't have just numbers on their own because it's not HP. And each wound is a countdown clock of its own. Whereas stress is points you accumulate and they turn into reactions and insanities when you get too much of them. But the actual transition from points to fiction still needs work.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_414551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Denys" title="Denys"><img alt="Denys" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j128/iannoble/elf-pic.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Denys">Denys</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/414551/#Comment_414551" name="Item_79" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-05-22T14:13:39+00:00" title="May 22, 2013  2:13PM">May 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had a thread a couple months back that talked about making Tremulus, well, better... especially focused on Lore moves.

You can get the situation up and running within about six.<br/><br/>The diceless stuff works (in my head) but needs testing over a longer period to see where the kinks are. The Suspicion economy is probably a bit broken: I think the GM will probably gain tons and tons of Suspicion over time.<br/><br/>The biggest thing to make sure of in the next draft is that the cultists to have real lives they have to live when they're not worshipping the dark god Soth. I'm not sure how to do that yet, but one way is to have the townsfolk want interesting social stuff from the cultists (like family responsibilities, or showing the pressures of the cultists' day

been putting together <a href="http://black-stars-rise.appspot.com/" rel="nofollow">Black Stars Rise</a>, a game that's about weird happenings in small town america - the sort of stuff that happens in the X-Files before Mulder and Scully show up, or if they never showed up. One innovation of theirs I particularly like is that you're given your moves on cards, and you're not allowed to look on the other side of the card until that move is wounded. Then you flip it over and use the worse version of the move, which might be more prone to failure, give you hard choices to make or not be able to provide as good an outcome. Also, the scenario seeds work a lot like the Dungeon Starters that were put together for Dungeon World; you have a paragraph of setup, options to choose from to describe the weirdness, and connections the PCs can pick with each other to get the ball rolling.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_424821">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/waqii" title="waqii"><img alt="waqii" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nKKM3K4RK06QZ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/waqii">waqii</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/424821/#Comment_424821" name="Item_90" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-11-26T04:05:36+00:00" title="November 26, 2013  4:05AM">November 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really want to try Black Stars Rise out at some point, because I really like its simplicity and style.

You can get the situation up and running within about six.<br/><br/>The diceless stuff works (in my head) but needs testing over a longer period to see where the kinks are. The Suspicion economy is probably a bit broken: I think the GM will probably gain tons and tons of Suspicion over time.<br/><br/>The biggest thing to make sure of in the next draft is that the cultists to have real lives they have to live when they're not worshipping the dark god Soth.
