He would determine a lot of back story, stating things about Diesel that Nick was uncomfortable with because they didn\u2019t fit his image of the character.  He provided a lot of the \u201creasons\u201d behind things, leaving little room for development.  He definitely had a story in mind, and he was telling it.</blockquote>\nI've seen this, too, with new non-gamers playing "story games". In games featuring character advocacy, they struggle to narrate things into play while also leaving room for those characters to retain their free will. I think it has something to do with the fact that we know how stories go, and what's dramatic, but not necessarily how to take just one part of that (something like a Sorcerer "Bang") and leave the reaction up to another person.<br/><br/>Once I played a game of mine ("Land of Nodd") with a non-gamer, and whenever it was his turn to frame a scene, he used the worst railroading I've ever seen, every time, even after I'd told him it wasn't a good idea ("If I'm playing a character in your scene, and you don't leave me any room to decide what the character is doing, there's nothing for me to do at all"), because he couldn't quite figure out how. Not unlike an inexperienced GM trying to run a "story-based" D&amp;D session for the first time.<br/><br/>Has anyone else experienced this? Are there any good ways around it, or to avoid it?<br/><br/>It can tremendously difficult to tell the person right there that they're "playing wrong", as the author of that account says.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271707">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271707/#Comment_271707" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T13:49:57+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  1:49PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the best teaching I got was on WotC's free-form chat, "Narrate intent, not outcome", and "You can only affect yourself".<br/><br/>I think attributing it to "Non-gamers" may be a bit of a false move, since what about traditional games? What about story-games with a DM? Removing the DM might seem to us to be the default today, but it's not how story/indie games were at the beginning.<br/><br/>I think it's something that just goes away. Keep reminding people to narrate intent and not income, explain how leaving more things up to chance might leave more room for others to contribute. But, let's be honest, it's a preference. Some people would rather have less excitement and "Crazy awesome!" ideas from their peers, and would rather have more control over their characters. This is not a bug, it's a feature. Basically, each player gets to let the others have as much control as <i>they</i> are comfortable giving.<br/>Control is surrendered, it is not taken. Railroading and affecting others is not the same, and the concept of "State intent, not result" should be stressed again.<br/><br/>I think in the end it's an issue that time, and watching others narrate, will "solve". Solve in the manner that the players will gravitate to however much control they're comfortable giving, which might not be the "default" one expects.<br/><br/>Also, you can look at the other side. They don't imagine all control must be within one player's hands. Heck, they take all control into your hands, and then you get to take all control into your hands <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_271711">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271711/#Comment_271711" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T14:06:23+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  2:06PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Just to be clear, in my experience, at least, and I think in the post I linked to, as well, the problem isn't as much a player playing a character (we have conflict resolution tools, etc, to deal with that), but a player taking on GM responsibilities.<br/><br/>"State intent, not result" is easier to explain in the context of playing a character. When framing a scene, though, and explaining the character's place in it, it's much trickier. For instance, "You're running down the road, there's three armed gangsters on motorcycles chasing you!" is OK, though very "hard" framing. But, "You're running down the road to get to the government office, where you've decide to turn yourself in," or "Then you turn left, because a small helpless child catches your eye," that would step on most people's toes.<br/><br/>Not an easy challenge! How do we learn to frame aggressively enough that we don't have to justify previously-made decisions (you don't want to start framing a scene by explaining that the character bought a ticket to go to the cinema, then met his ex-lover there and decided to storm out in the middle of the movie, and that's why they're in the alley without their cell phone) but not so aggressively that we remove player agency from the picture? I see things like "Bangs" and various adventure modules as constructed tools to help us do this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_271717">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/271717/#Comment_271717" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-05-17T14:36:54+00:00" title="May 17, 2010  2:36PM">May 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 17, 2010 2:39PM by Thunder_God.">edited May 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You again need to give examples, use the examples you stated above, and state why it's stating the resolution rather than the intent, why it sets the resolution of the situation rathing than merely setting up the situation.<br/><br/>What people want to do, what people will do, that's the resolution.

There are three roles, all unique. The Gun Thief is the protagonist. The Law frames scenes and introduces conflicts. The Jagged Women meddle and add twists and convolute.<br/><br/>So... there are specifics that you can point someone to. "That. That's your unique role. That's what you do, the list you choose from, and when you choose. It's all right there."<br/><br/>The only thing is... the game requires everyone to be pretty vigilant about honoring those roles, and that can involve the hard task of... killing over-eager, out-of-role narration.<br/><br/>And that's the hard part, for me. Not in describing where the boundaries are, but in having to step in and be the heavy and say <i>you can't do that</i>. It always feels weird and hard, and like I am running the risk of squashing someone's joy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
