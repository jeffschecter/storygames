                    (xposted with the Forge and my website, and there should be something on the IPR website soon....)<br/><br/>The blurb:<br/><br/>Hamsterprophet Productions will be donating 15% of all sales of <b>carry. a game about war.</b> to the <a href="http://www.nvvam.org" rel="nofollow">National Vietnam Veterans Art Museum</a> in recognition of Veterans Day.<br/><br/>Every copy of <b>carry. a game about war.</b> sold over Veteranâ€™s Day weekend (November 10 to November 13th) will add $2.50 to the total donation. From the NVVAM website:
<blockquote>MISSION<br/> <br/>The National Vietnam Veterans Art Museum inspires greater understanding of the real impact of war with a focus on Vietnam. The museum collects, preserves and exhibits art inspired by combat and created by veterans.</blockquote>
You can purchase the game from <a href="http://indiepressrevolution.com/products.php?publisherLink=hamsterprophet" rel="nofollow">Indie Press Revolution</a>. You can see some more about the game <a href="http://www.hamsterprophetproductions.com/wordpress/?p=21" rel="nofollow">here</a> and check out some support materials and an audio demo <a href="http://www.hamsterprophetproductions.com/wordpress/?page_id=6" rel="nofollow">here</a><br/><br/>As for the choice of donation: The mission of the NVVAM dovetails exactly with my feelings on why we should remember and continue to explore Vietnam. I suggest that you take the time to browse some of the art available on the website; it is a powerful thing, even through the digital remove. I would really like to be able to donate a substantial amount to this great cause, and if youâ€™ve been pondering picking up the game, I think now would be the best time to do it!<br/><br/>end blurb<br/><br/>I also just realized that I'll be running the game on Veteran's Day at JiffyCon.<br/><br/>Wow.                </div>

                            And it was great. <br/><br/>I really liked the moment before we started playing, where we all said what our connections to the military are/have been, and who we are/were close to who is/was a veteran. Is that a regular part of the game, or was it a time/place thing? I found it really helped me pit a human face on the characters before even starting play, and I found myself thinking of the other 'fodder' as men like my uncles.                        </div>

                            Yeh, our game was rockin'. Less "stab-yourself-in-the-face-afterwards" and more "war-is-hell-but-they-all-got-out-ok", but hey, thats a good thing.<br/><br/>It is indeed part of the game. During Burden creation, the text directs the GM to ask what anyone doesn't want to see in play, and to ask if anyone at the table has any military experience or has some relation to the military. I'm glad it had that effect for you, Meg!                        </div>
