I wanted to turn around and watch the film again but the next showing was also sold out (we bought tickets last week for our theater's version of IMAX).<br/><br/>It is comic book come to life.

The testosterone was thick in the air and the desire to be in the battle welling up at the edge of their little heavy fighter eyes. <br/><br/>I thought it was a superb realization of the comic and yes it makes one want to game, maybe not at Thermopole but in other battles. It should be something that encourages rediculous bravery like Wushu, a trust mechanic like Thirty and a doom to live up to.<br/><br/>One downside of the movie were the ubiquitous, almost cartoon, gobbets of blood.

Gerard Butler (King Leonidas), Lena Headey (Queen Gorgo), Dominic West (Theron), David Wenham (Dilios), and Andrew Tiernan (Ephialtes) were all very good!<br/>\n- I am 50/50 on Rodrigo Santoro (Xerxes).<br/>\n- Dominic West (Jimmy McNulty from the wire) actually had a lot of screen time. He was awesome. And played an asshole as always. But an asshole with no redeeming qualities here. He has some cool lines.<br/>\n- Not a lot of character development going on. I didn't care when people died.<br/>\n- Although Andrew Tiernan (Ephialtes) had lots of character development and I actually cared about him.<br/>\n- Lena Headey (Queen Gorgo) was also pretty bad ass with lots of screen time.<br/>\n- The movie is bad ass.<br/>\n- The dialog was fun and bad ass.<br/>\n- David Wenham (Dilios) narrating was bad ass.<br/>\n- The fighting was EXTREMELY bad ass.<br/>\n- Too much slow motion.<br/>\n- A few too many jokes during combat (not as bad as lord of the rings)<br/>\n- Combat was bloody as hell (many limbs cut off and decapitations)<br/>\n- But combat also felt cartoony for some reason.<br/>\n- No man on man love.<br/>\n- In fact, this movie's slogan should have been... THIS IS HETEROSEXUAL!!!<br/>\n- The Spartan's even mock the Athenian's for being boy lovers. I thought it was a setup for them claiming to love real men. But nothing.<br/>\n- To contrast this, they showed Xerxes as being feminine which was annoying.<br/>\n- I didn't find the bad guys being mostly asian, black, or monsters as offensive as I thought I would. The crowd we saw it with were 75% black easily and they didn't seem to care. I'd say 50% of the bad guys were unknown, 25% monsters, 15% asian, 10% black.<br/>\n- OMG... stop with the preaching! We get it! Freedom this, freedom that. We aren't slaves. We are free.<br/>\n- Sometimes the Spartan reminded me too much of football players from high school but I can understand why.<br/>\n- I know I mentioned this already but waaaay too much slow motion!!! Not just in the fight scenes but all over the place.<br/>\n- They had themes of anti-mysticism. I didn't understand why.<br/>\n- No mention of the Spartan slaves or why they are warriors.<br/>\n- They showed a man with a goat head at some point!!! What???<br/>\n- There was lots of kick ass fighting and I never got tired of it. Not too much and not too little. I just wish I cared about the stakes more.<br/>\n- The movie also looked really cool. I like the color tones and painted backgrounds.<br/>\n<br/>\nSecond time I saw it (I have purchased tickets for Thursday night before I knew Terry won early screening tickets):<br/>\n<br/>\n- It was better than the first time.<br/>\n- I felt this time I could put aside the many "simple' aspects of the movie, lack of character investment, and the overwhelming "we're heterosexual crap".<br/>\n- I'd see it again. It's a spectacle. Both times I saw it, most people clapped at the end of the movie. It's simple but the acting and visuals are really, really good.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Village Voice has a funny review:<br/>\n<a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0710,lee,75993,20.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.villagevoice.com/film/0710,lee,75993,20.html</a><br/>\n"Delicacies of dismemberment aside, 300 is notable for its outrageous sexual confusion. Here stands the Spartan king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and his 299 buddies in nothing but leather man-panties and oiled torsos, clutching a variety of phalluses they seek to thrust in the bodies of their foes by trapping them in a small, rectum-like mountain passage called the "gates of hell(o!)" Yonder rises the Persian menace, led by the slinky, mascara'd Xerxes. When he's not flaring his nostrils at Leonidas and demanding he kneel down before his, uh, majesty, this flamboyantly pierced crypto-transsexual lounges on chinchilla throw pillows amidst a rump-shaking orgy of disfigured lesbians."<br/>\n<br/>\nThe NY Times review just sucked and was mean spirited. I wanted to punch out the reviewer. There were so many more things to make fun of, such as the rabid sexual confusion, rather than focusing on how it was simple and non nuanced. Come on, did they fucking watch the commercial for this movie? It clearly advertised a bunch of semi naked men yelling all the time and kicking ass. And the movie delivered. Now if it claimed to be something else, I would understand. But damn, were those trailer and commercials selling the truth. The movie over delivered in its selling points!!!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60343">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60343/#Comment_60343" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T07:38:21+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  7:38AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also of note - it was filmed almost entirely against bluescreen.  In Montreal.  There's a painterly quality to it that comes from <i>every bit of it not being real.</i>  Zack Snyder has some directorial tics that carried over from his (also good) Dawn of the Dead remake - all the TV commercial smash cuts, the speed-up-slow-down wankery - but it works for me.  He's his own dude - apparently somebody schooled him on how a phalanx actually worked, as opposed to what he wanted to shoot, and he said "I want it to look cool, though."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60365">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/eruditus" title="eruditus"><img alt="eruditus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/840/nWPS4QS6N8MFD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/eruditus">eruditus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60365/#Comment_60365" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T10:34:29+00:00" title="March 10, 2007 10:34AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah.  I honestly believe that this is what the current technological feats of film-making were meant to accomplish.  Like Sin City it could paint a completely realized world of it's own.  I was giddy watching it.  I had high expectations and surprisingly it met every one. This was a movie about bad ass guys bred for combat to strut their stuff.  One diffinitive line (among many kick ass one liners) was when a Spartan is talking to an Acadian looking over the miles of Persian encampments.  He laughs and when the Acadian presses him the Spartan says "maybe with so many warriors out there there may actually be a chance I can find one to provide me with a beautiful death."<br><br>These guys are real superheroes.  They may not fly (although they do have capes) they approach every situation knowing they will either kick ass or die trying.  One interesting part of this film (and the comic) was that amid the fantasy there were interesting bits about historical Spartans that shine through - such as how the phalanx was effective and why they could wade into combat with no armor save a helmet and shield - it made them fast and manueverable.  And there are many accounts that demonstrated (in a flashy, action movie sort of way) how versitile the spear was compared to the swords most of the other combatants had.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60387">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60387/#Comment_60387" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T14:23:32+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  2:23PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2007 2:24PM by Josh Roby.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>On the way home, we turned to each other and said, "please, God, don't let George W.

That move (which I don't know if it comes from the graphic novel, since I've only glanced at it) made the movie much more palpatable for me, since I experienced it as "This is Dilios telling the story to motivate the counsel, and then later to motivate the other soldiers -- he focuses on what matters to his audience--asskickery and propaganda."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60393">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60393/#Comment_60393" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T15:12:39+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  3:12PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, that was a little bit that I liked: there was a part of the movie that was "what happened, as seen by Dillios" and the rest was "what Dillios would really like to have happened" which included the certain body piercings being lost by certain people.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx" title="Lord_Minx"><img alt="Lord_Minx" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lord_Minx">Lord_Minx</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60394/#Comment_60394" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T15:17:10+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  3:17PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Damn, I can't wait to see this movie... ^_^                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60400">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jenskot" title="jenskot"><img alt="jenskot" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.nerdnyc.com/phpBB3/images/smilies/icon_custom_metal.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jenskot">jenskot</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60400/#Comment_60400" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-10T15:37:33+00:00" title="March 10, 2007  3:37PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            MRUnderwood, Joshua... awesome!!!

In the book, the Spartans mentioned fighting for "freedom" a couple times, but didn't harp endlessly on it.<br><br>* The book did mention the role that the Athenians had in fighting the Persians, mentioning both Marathon and the Athenian naval victories that made the Spartans land battles meaningful.<br><br>* The whole "queen as whore" subplot was completely new to the movie.<br><br>So, my criticism of the movie remains the same, but I liked the book quite a bit better.<br><br>As a side note, having read the book, I also have to acknowledge that the movie did an amazing job of being visually faithful to the comic, in much the same way that Sin City was.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60506/#Comment_60506" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-11T17:58:52+00:00" title="March 11, 2007  5:58PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I loved it.

I managed to sit through parts of <i>Sin City </i>on cable and, after reading the reviews, I'm not even planning to see <i>300</i> -- and I'm the guy who started a magazine article on U.S. war casualties with a Thermopylae reference (see <a href="http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0504/052804nj1.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0504/052804nj1.htm</a>). With the marginal exception of the Bruce Willis character, <i>Sin City </i> struck me as a war between characters who were merely inhumanly superhuman and those who were monstrously inhuman, laced with more sex=death confusion than anything I've seen in Western culture since Wagner. I don't think I need any more of that.<br><br>I'm not trying to condemn anyone else's taste here. For those of you who can appreciate these movies as pure motion and color, accented with one-liners -- as a death ballet as divorced from the reality of human conflict as <i>The Nutcracker</i> is from the reality of human love -- more power to you. I'm able to enjoy watching the lobby firefight in the first <i>Matrix</i>movie, which totally creeps my wife out, and I don't think my wife's taste is inherently superior or inferior to mine based on her violence threshold, any more than a Frank Miller fan's taste is inherently superior to mine because I can't appreciate <i>Sin City</i> and <i>300</i>, which are probably another step up the sex=death scale from <i>The Matrix</i>. But, wow, anyone else gicked out by these films has my heartfelt sympathy.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60558">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen" title="Christian_Griffen"><img alt="Christian_Griffen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.berengad.com/public/h-small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Christian_Griffen">Christian_Griffen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60558/#Comment_60558" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T09:25:15+00:00" title="March 12, 2007  9:25AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm going to see it and hopefully enjoy it for what it is, though I thought Sin City was horribly sexist and based on shock value instead of good characterization.

I even think there was something about getting permission to leave barracks to go **** your wife.<br/><br/>On the upside, the Spartans gave their women much more freedom than the democratic Athenians, including encouraging organized sports (which they eventually had to ban men from other cities from coming to leer at) to strengthen their bodies for bearing strong warrior children -- ironic, given that we now know that exercise delays the onset of menarche. By contrast, upper-class Athenians tended to lock their women away on the inside rooms of the house and not let them see anyone but relatives. All that veiling and seclusion stuff we think of as Arabic? They're actually bad habits picked up from upper-class Greeks when the Arabs conquered half the Byzantine Empire in the 7th-9th centuries.<br/><br/>Side note: The Muslims in general, and the Arabs in particular, are the direct heirs of ancient Greece, not "the West" (i.e. Europeans, European-descended North Americans like myself, Australians, etc.). Most of what we got from Greece, we got second-hand through the Arabs or through Rome (specifically the Western Empire), albeit there was some direct contact with Byzantium -- but even there, far less intense than the Byzantine-Arab interchange.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_60613">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman" title="Ben_Lehman"><img alt="Ben_Lehman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.livejournal.com/userpic/23973349/929253"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ben_Lehman">Ben_Lehman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60613/#Comment_60613" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T11:13:00+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 11:13AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            300 is set in an alternate universe where the Spartans weren't gay.<br/><br/>Also, this thread is set in an alternate universe where anything remotely resembling modern racism existed in Homeric times.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_60614">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost" title="Eric Provost"><img alt="Eric Provost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/066/nS7AISWAU7YO3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eric%20Provost">Eric Provost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/60614/#Comment_60614" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-12T11:15:03+00:00" title="March 12, 2007 11:15AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2007 11:18AM by Eric Provost.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>I'm with Jason.

You know, the main reason why I liked it is because of how the movie uses an unreliable narrator, which elevates the quality of the script beyond the over-the-top action stuff. It's not even really the story of the 300 at all - it's <i>Dilios'</i> story of the 300. He brainwashes a nation into war with this story. <br/><br/>So, of course he describes the Persians as deformed, twisted, decadent people. Of course he tells the Spartans that they fought ogres and crap, and that there were enough arrows in flight to blot out the sky. Of course he glorifies Leonidas' decision to go against the dictates of his society. I mean, most of his narration borders on chanting if you listen closely - lots of repeated phrases and dialogue for emphasis, the hypnosis of ritual. He totally makes up the scene at Xerxes' court, and he totally makes up the end of the film.<br/><br/>All the stuff you actually see on screen? Smoke and mirrors. It distracts people from questioning his authority as narrator.<br/><br/>And in showing how all this can be accomplished, I think it has a little more social value than people are giving it due. People getting duped by propagandist media and patriotic double-talk into supporting a war? That doesn't remind me of anything that's happened recently, not at all...<br/><br/>(Edit: In other words, what Jason Morningstar said, only more verbose.

But you can't assume that just because the creator of a work only provides you one point of view, that the creator's intent is for you to buy what that point of view is selling, or that the creator buys into it either. The unreliable narrator is one of the oldest devices in fiction.<br/><br/>And besides, how relevant is creator intent here anyway? All Frank Miller's told interviewers is that it's about how heroic those men were, standing up to overwhelming odds for the sake of their principles. Zack Snyder, the director, has repeatedly denied that there's political commentary in it. Assuming they're not just being coy, that puts everything we've been talking about in this thread in the realm of "reading too much into it" if you go by their intent.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Georgios" title="Georgios"><img alt="Georgios" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Georgios">Georgios</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61230/#Comment_61230" name="Item_70" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-15T12:15:49+00:00" title="March 15, 2007 12:15PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Landon Darkwood</cite><br/>Of course.

I'm obviously talking about the former and not the latter.<br/><br/>As for the relevance of the author's intention: if you want to talk about quality and content of a text you need to take into account the author's intention. Not doing so, is like talking about your post by talking about my reactions to it and completely ignoring what it was you tried to say. It's an option, of course, but I'm interested in talking about the text and not about mine or other people's personal responses to it.<br/><br/>300 is an audio-visual spectacle that uses the narrative structure of war propaganda, just like Miller's graphic novel. As such it is aggressively manipulative in its storytelling and simplistic in the values it propagates. Claiming that 300 has some kind of sophisticated narrative trickery, clever subversion through subtext or anything like that is really "reading too much into it". The whole point of 300 is its visceral effect on the audience and "the primal carnage unleashed on the screen". As I said, it's a spectacle and not for the mind. It's designed to grab you in the cockles of your hearts, maybe below the cockles, maybe in the subcockle area. <br/><br/>Personally, I find it very distasteful because of the way it chooses to talk about war. But that's a question of personal preference.<br/><br/>Zack Snyder is perfectly right, when he says that 300 is not political, because the war effort it celebrates is long passed and everybody involved is long dead. But yet 300 is highly political, because it's entertainment dressed up as war propaganda in a time when the US is at war (by any other name) and most Americans seem to disapprove. Now, I don't think that 300 is an attempt to sway public opinion on Iraq (cause that would be ridiculous), but you have to admit that the timing is not very fortunate. And I cannot blame people for feeling a little uneasy about this.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_61241">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera" title="Leonard Balsera"><img alt="Leonard Balsera" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Leonard%20Balsera">Leonard Balsera</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61241/#Comment_61241" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-15T13:12:18+00:00" title="March 15, 2007  1:12PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 15, 2007 1:12PM by Leonard Balsera.">edited March 2007</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Georgios</cite>As for the relevance of the author's intention: if you want to talk about quality and content of a text you need to take into account the author's intention.</blockquote>\nReally? On the Star Wars thread, the general consensus seems to be that everything good about the films is stuff that was completely unintentional on Lucas' part, assuming you trust the content of his commentaries and interviews. (And so y'all know, in case it's relevant, I don't. Not just Lucas, but creators and performers in general.) It's common for a work to be praised or vilified for qualities it possesses in spite of the author's intent.\n<blockquote>Claiming that 300 has some kind of sophisticated narrative trickery, clever subversion through subtext or anything like that is really "reading too much into it".</blockquote>\nSophisticated? I wouldn't go that far. But neither do I think that you can ignore those elements as just a side effect of the simple spectacle. We're probably going to just have to agree to disagree there, and that's cool. I just think it's telling that the movie included the detail of Dilios' leaving before the events actually resolved, with the explicit command to tell the Spartans a grand, rousing tale. It damages the tale's effectiveness as propaganda on the viewer - you know Dilios is making it all up at the end, and by extension, probably all the stuff before it about there being ogres and crap, and Xerxes being this 12-foot tall guy who looks like King Tut at a rave.<br/><br/>Is it Nabokov? Obviously not. But I think it's worth noticing, because it's the one area in which the film breaks the narrative structure of war propaganda and includes some self-awareness.\n<blockquote>Now, I don't think that 300 is an attempt to sway public opinion on Iraq (cause that would be ridiculous), but you have to admit that the timing is not very fortunate.

You're still talking about audience reception and I'm talking about text analysis. You'd be talking about what people like about Star Wars (which has nothing to with what Lucas wanted) and I'd be talking about how well Star Wars does what it's supposed to do (which requires at least a rough idea of what Lucas wanted). \n<blockquote>I just think it's telling that the movie included the detail of Dilios' leaving before the events actually resolved, with the explicit command to tell the Spartans a grand, rousing tale.

There's no change there. No additional self-awareness. And I see no indication that this isn't more than simple plot-necessity ("If the Persians killed everybody, then who's telling the story?") or the option to add a cathartic reveal ("The Spartan's death wasn't completely pointless, it served to unite us against the Persians."). Although I admit that this is partly based on my low opinion of Frank Miller as a writer.<br/><br/>I also don't think it damages the story's effectiveness as propaganda. For that the Spartans' death would have to be painted as completely irrelevant. As it is it works just fine: the death of the Spartan soldiers is still glorified, they still slaughtered and got slaughtered for "a reason". The whole point of war propaganda is to convince people that killing the other guy is the right thing to do and dieing while doing so isn't all that bad, because you died for "a reason". 300 works perfectly in this regard, as evidenced by the ending.<br/><br/>Of course, 300 isn't actual war propaganda. It just uses its trappings. The attack of the Persian Empire on Greece isn't really current news, after all. 300 wants to be sanitized war propaganda.

And I must say, I really enjoyed it. It had everything I was looking for in my popcorn cinema:<br/><br/>-Cool fight scenes<br/>-Awesome visuals<br/>-Cute women<br/>-Cute men<br/>-One Liners you can scream at the top of your lung before breaking down laughing<br/>-Stuff you can laugh about (Hyper-Heterosexual Spartans as Heroes for Freedom: The irony was delicious! ^_^ )<br/><br/>It had all that and more, perfect. Certainly no high art and it could have been even better (If only the queen had stayed as kickass. Still, cool character...), but it was a highly enjoyable movie. Defenitly looking forward to see it again. (When I drag another friend who didn't want to go today into the cinema, because I KNOW he will love it.)<br/><br/>M                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div><div class="P PagerWrap"><div class="Pager NumberedPager NumberedPager" id="PagerAfter"><a class="Previous" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2622/300-just-out-of-the-theater-impressions" rel="prev">\xab</a><a class=" p-1 FirstPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2622/300-just-out-of-the-theater-impressions" rel="prev">1</a><a class="Highlight p-2 LastPage" href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/2622/300-just-out-of-the-theater-impressions/p2">2</a><span class="Next">\xbb</span></div></div></div> <div class="Foot Closed">\n<div class="Note Closed SignInOrRegister"><a class="Popup" href="/forums/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2622%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Sign In</a> or <a href="/forums/entry/register?Target=discussion%2F2622%2Fx%2Fp2%3F">Register</a> to comment.                    </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="Foot">\n<div class="Row">\n<a class="PoweredByVanilla" href="https://open.vanillaforums.com" title="Community Software by Vanilla Forums">Forum Software\n                Powered by Vanilla</a>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body>\n</html>
