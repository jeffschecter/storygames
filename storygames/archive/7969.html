So my Sister-in-law is throwing my wife and I a co-ed baby shower at our home tomorrow. Buuut. . .turns out "throwing" for her means "bring cupcakes and sangria, let us handle the rest of the catering, invites, activities, and whatever."<br/><br/>So, there are supposed to be games. Of some kind. And now I have been asked to come up with some. I've searched for icebreaker/party games, and there are a couple of innocuous "get to know you" games that might be, like, OK. But then there's a lot of crap. And since, y'know, games are my "thing," I don't wanna turn out some lame nonsense like "pin t he baby on the pregnant belly" (real "Baby Shower Game!" swear to God!).<br/><br/>So Storygamers, I need your help! What quick and easy game ideas are floating around in your brains, suitable for a party that aren't lame Jr High shit? Assume that they need to be low-prep, low-equipment, and low-explanation. Assume that they need to play in 10-20 minutes. Assume that they will be played by like, a dozen people, maybe more. Assume that they will be played by a mixed crowd of roleplaying friends, hippie friends, punk-art friends, beer-and-pretzel friends, stodgy relatives, Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians and Anarchists. Assume that a "baby" theme should maybe be graftable onto it.<br/><br/>Oh, and assume that I know of Sea Dracula, love Sea Dracula, and probably will not be using Sea Dracula.<br/><br/>Ideas?<br/><br/>Peace,<br/>-Joel                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176153">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176153/#Comment_176153" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T18:43:39+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  6:43PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play "It Was A Mutual Decision" and revel in the irony of playing a game about a break up at a celebration of the ultimate expression of union?<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176156">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X" title="Caesar_X"><img alt="Caesar_X" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Caesar_X">Caesar_X</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176156/#Comment_176156" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T19:04:11+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  7:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=7932&amp;page=1#Item_34" rel="nofollow">Werewolf</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176159">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176159/#Comment_176159" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-24T20:04:36+00:00" title="October 24, 2008  8:04PM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 24, 2008 8:07PM by Joli.">edited October 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Huh.

You needn't use pyramids--Legos are fine, too; and even playing cards or matchboxes have enough characteristics (and can be oriented) to make koans. Now, I WILL advise that you drop the player-building and Master/Mondo rules. Instead, just let folks guess and then you make a disproving koan, if they are wrong. The strategic element of Mondo is sort of hard to "get" for non-gamers, but anyone can look for patterns and guess. Zendo also has a neat feature in that folks can come and go, during play, with no real problems--all the koans are there, for a new-comer to study (though it can irk folks when a new-comer walks up and guesses it in one go--distance is often an advantage), and no individual (other than the current Master) is critical to continuing play.<br/><br/>As for a baby-themed Mafia variant... how about "changlings"? Two fairies kids, in a nursery, with the "villagers" being normal kids, and the "seer" being--I dunno--a nurse or doctor? (FYI, two changlings assumes between 8 and 15 players--add one more, for more total players.)<br/><br/>I want to recommend Long Live the King, but it takes quite a while to play, and there's only seven "core" roles, with everyone else playing extras (often multiple Status roles, as they are needed). But if you have seven or so "hard core" players, they could enjoy it while others drift in and out of play, as extras. Make your wife the Queen, of course! <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Other than those, I'm sort of drawing a blank. There's not many games that support upwards of a dozen players (some non-gamers) while being fast. Texas Hold'Em tourney with small starting chip counts, maybe?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_176207">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176207/#Comment_176207" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T09:21:30+00:00" title="October 25, 2008  9:21AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Apples to Apples, after the Baby-themed Werewolf.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_176215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" title="Eero_Tuovinen"><img alt="Eero_Tuovinen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.arkkikivi.net/foorumi/templates/Arkkikivi/images/folder_big.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen">Eero_Tuovinen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/176215/#Comment_176215" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-10-25T10:01:33+00:00" title="October 25, 2008 10:01AM">October 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That president rpg could actually be a good choice.
