If it doesn't involve Exploration of the crotch region, then unfortunately you're out of luck.  You'll either have to find a new group, or convince them to play a game that does support Simulation of this sort of occurrence.  The most important thing is REALISM!  There's a big difference between actually itching and pretending that your character itches.  You want to be fully immersed, for sure.  If you can't convince others to join you, the group's Creative Agenda is incoherent, and the game will be dysfunctional.  No one wants dysfunction in that, er, region, so it's a thing to avoid.  You have been warned!<br/><br/>Once you have a coherent CA, then there are some Techniques for establishing what things you can put in the Shared Imagining Space (i.e. where you can put your hand.)  Those Techniques rely on certain moment-to-moment motions, but I'm sure if you get this far, you'll be able to figure it out for yourself.<br/><br/>Hope that helps!<br/>~Sibling Machine Gun of Enlightened Reason                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_137521">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy" title="Joe Murphy"><img alt="Joe Murphy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://userpic.livejournal.com/804143/412754"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Murphy">Joe Murphy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/137521/#Comment_137521" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-04-01T15:54:41+00:00" title="April  1, 2008  3:54PM">April 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 1, 2008 3:55PM by Joe Murphy.">edited April 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Paul, I've gamed with you.
