'That's right,' I said, 'one of those ironic names.') and send them off to secure the Owl while the players sabotage the Sorrow's engines. Snargle: "They're totally going to steal our ship." Oh yes they are. It is, of course, slowly leaving the bay just as the PC's arrive.<br/><br/>Fiasco gets better and better each time I play it. We did both high school (one of the players later told me that the game made him a little uncomfortable because it was so close to his real high school experience) and the Mercury playset but didn't have the additional material, so we did a pre-2001 sixties-era feel sci-fi, with silver rocketships and spacesuits, computers that printed things out, expenses in the millions of dollars. Even though one of the scientists dug up a garden gnome in the eternal peaks of the Fu crater, it wasn't gonzo - it was a time-travel convergence, the gnome had come back from the future when humans colonize Mercury. The Mercurial alien intelligence wasn't happy about that. It felt almost like a game of Geiger Counter - everybody died. I pulled two tricks from the Companion - started at a funeral and killed myself in my second scene, following a mysterious astronaut into the airlock where he cycled it before I had my suit on. Add ghosts. Seriously, it didn't feel gonzo to me. Really. We did the 'write down unanswered questions' trick as we introduced strange mysteries into the plot, and made an effort to resolve them before we were done.<br/><br/>Paul pulled the hardest MC move I've been hit with evar in the Regiment - playing a woman in the resistance sneaking through a house on the way to the front lines I blow an 'assess the situation' roll.  "There's movement in the kitchen. It's kill or be killed," Paul says. "Um, I'll have to go for kill," I say. "You fire. Actually, turns out it's not a soldier, it's an eight year old girl, running into the room, her mother behind her trying to stop her." Yikes! I was expecting Inglorious Basterds and I got Sophie's Choice! I spent the rest of the game kind of in shock. That was a brutal game. Only one soldier survived. Awesome.<br/><br/>And still back home in time to put the kids in bed and earn wife points. Good times.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340841">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mattastic" title="mattastic"><img alt="mattastic" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/ldwgS.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mattastic">mattastic</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340841/#Comment_340841" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T12:25:58+00:00" title="August 29, 2011 12:25PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Anyone have videos of any of the PAX RPG panels?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340849">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340849/#Comment_340849" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T13:49:58+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  1:49PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2011 1:52PM by J_Walton.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran Apocalypse World on Friday night and the folks enjoyed it so much that most of them came back on Saturday for more and we may end up organizing some additional sessions in the coming months, since they were mostly from Bellevue.  I'm starting to have some serious brainwaves about setting up a con scenario for AW that really shows off its teeth but still lets players do most of character creation.  Keep an eye out for that as soon as I get time to write it up.<br/><br/>I ran Mouse Guard for a handful of awesome folks from Virginia on Sunday.  Our party was Thom, Sadie, Robin, and Saxon, which was an interesting mix. I really dig the new tools in the box set, especially the action and weapon cards and the new character sheets.  Nice work, Luke!  I had to look some stuff up, since it'd been a while since I'd played it, but they seemed to enjoy themselves and said they were going to check out the comics and probably get the game.<br/><br/>Last of all, I ran Dungeon World -- having never read the entire book, just riffing off my AW background and playing once with Sage -- for my friend Ian (in my MA class at UW, neither of us knew the other played dork games before he stumbled on me running AW on Saturday), Morgan, and another cool guy whose name I forget (sorry!).  We did the Bloodstone Idol and they managed to kill the demon without getting completely burnt to a crisp!  We had to stop before they explored further, but it was solid fun.<br/><br/>Over dinner on Friday (or Saturday? they blur together), I got to see a brief demo of Logan Bonner's new card-based game-in-the-works, which was equal parts Danger Patrol and something else entirely (though Logan's never read or played DP, I don't think).  Finally bought his game Refuge In Audacity, which is the awesome parts of Rifts and Synnibar pasted together with cheese and wrapped in bacon. You should attempt to acquire it on behalf of the 14yo kid inside you.<br/><br/>Saw two previously-unheard-of video games that excited me. 1) <a href="http://www.indiegamechallenge.com/finalists/qube/" rel="nofollow">QUBE</a>, made by a cool indie studio from south Wales, who came a long way for PAX.  It's like Portal + Tetris + Minecraft and looks to be a cool new entry in the slowly emerging "first-person puzzler" genre.  2) <a href="http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2011.php?id=410" rel="nofollow">Faraway</a>, a little pixely reflex-based puzzle game where you play a streaking comet swinging off the gravity of nearby stars and attempt to draw loops and constellations.  I even bought the t-shift for that one.  Mesmerizing and addictive.<br/><br/>Saw a bunch of cool folks but didn't get into as many conversations about games as I wanted.  Missed most of the panels and workshops.  But, overall, super awesome and can't wait for it to be even better next year.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340853">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340853/#Comment_340853" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T13:55:15+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  1:55PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I also played in the same Regiment game as Jamie on Sunday.

More than that and it would have felt interminably long.  Running 4-hour games at a convention seems crazy to me now.  In two hours, we could do character creation and/or a brief overview and then hit play really hard, without fear of creative exhastion as long as you only ran a couple slots a day.  It was fast and intense and left players wanting more, which I think is exactly right.  The games were somewhere between a demo and a full session, which felt perfect for most indie games.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340856">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340856/#Comment_340856" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T14:14:29+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  2:14PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sage is a marathonist, and deserves a medal for it. I was busy enough with Enforcering and other stuff that I only got to stop by room 306 a couple times, including once for an excellent Dungeon World game (my first!) with Harper and some Portland friends, but any time I passed by I could tell that the room was hopping. It was a little rough to be across the hall from the doors-open, over-amplified Jamspace, but I was amused to see that there were always way more people playing games than listening to bad nerdcore.<br/><br/>As for other activities, it's been discussed on Twitter already, but the indie RPGs panel was FULL. Not just people trickling in, either--there was a line snaking all the way around the escalators well before start time. The panel itself clearly surpassed expectations, too!<br/><br/>Also, the tabletop games library seems to have a number of copies of Maid RPG in stock, and it was fascinating to watch the mix of facial expressions that ran across the face of any attendee who picked it up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340858">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus" title="Mathalus"><img alt="Mathalus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dramaclubshakespearegame.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/32-bear.jpg?w=32&amp;h=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mathalus">Mathalus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340858/#Comment_340858" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T14:44:35+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  2:44PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2011 2:45PM by Mathalus.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: J.

I went straight from the line outside to room 306 and I was beaten there by Sage and two people who wanted to play Fiasco for the first time.

Any other time I walked in to help run games, the place was already filled with other people playing stuff. Early Sunday morning was also mostly empty, no surprise.<br/><br/>Facts wise, the Indie Games on Demand room had 6 tables, one of which was taken up displaying indie games + info board, so we typically ran 5 games in a slot and sometimes spilled over into the neighboring "tabletop freeplay" room.  We really needed somebody manning the door all day to explain what was going on to people.  We managed this 60%+ of the time, it seems, and the folks that pitched in were AMAZING for doing that.<br/><br/>From talking to a number of people, it sounds like next year we might try to run it more like GoPlayNW, especially if we get a significantly larger space.  That means people could sign up to run or play things when they wandered into the room, rather than having to show up every 2 hours for the chance at making it into a game.  Overall, though, the 2-hour thing (thanks Ben!) worked really well for a no-planning, no-signup slapdash indie convention setup.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340865">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340865/#Comment_340865" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-29T15:21:31+00:00" title="August 29, 2011  3:21PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 29, 2011 3:22PM by sage.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mealtimes were actually our busiest time, particularly 6pm. I think Friday and Saturday's 6pm slots may have given me gray hair. We always got lines out the door to play just as all our GM's decided to go to dinner.

Clearly Mayfair has a lot of more resources! And it sounds like this is more an issue with GMs (or game facilitators) in this case.

What a weekend. <br/><br/>I facilitated some Fiascos, ran a session of Razed, ran a session of Lady Blackbird, and spent most of Friday (with other helpers) greeting people and explaining what GoD was to all manner of curious folk. If you came by and pawed through a copy of Dungeon World at the central table, that was probably my copy. I wish I'd done more.<br/><br/>From within my optimistic post-PAX aura, I'd say that the big things to improve are (a) getting more space and (b) better organizing manpower to let Sage breathe a bit. Lots of us were around, helping out and all\u2014and, yes, Sage can do the work of many dudes\u2014but the toil and stress could probably be better divided. (Sage, you're rad. You did a great job.)<br/><br/>I like the two-hour slots, with the understanding that double slots are possible when demand warrants it. I like the idea that we're getting in, maximizing everything, no time to futz around, feeling the rush, and getting on to the next game. That said, we could probably start games every hour or something. We got a couple of games going off the even-hour'd schedule, as I recall, but the biggest trouble with starting games whenever is not knowing when the next table's going to become available. That works fine when you have 110-120% of the room you need, but when space is tight, timing's important, I'd say.<br/><br/>Alas, I was one of those GMs who had to bail most meal times, since that's when most of my meetings were scheduled. (Though I didn't get to attend a single panel or workshop, 'cause I wanted to help staff when others couldn't, I feel like I could carry more weight next year). <br/><br/>My one real regret? The one thing I did design work on earlier in the year, specifically to take to PAX, to show to a couple of local designers I dig, never even made it out of my bag. Coordination was rough, schedules were imperfect. So it goes. <br/><br/>But I got to play games, shake hands, make friends, and tell people I admire that I dig their work. Great fun. For what it's worth, many thanks to all y'all who came by and spent time in that room. Y'all created a lot of good times this weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_340930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340930/#Comment_340930" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-30T08:55:35+00:00" title="August 30, 2011  8:55AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 30, 2011 10:30AM by sage.">edited August 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As some people have pointed out, I totally over-reached this con.

I introduced people to Escape from the Aliens of Outer Space, which is starting to be my "I will run this at the drop of a hat...any hat" game. Later, I demoed Do for a few folks -- which took just a touch over an hour. On Saturday, I ran Mythender for three fine people, which took me four hours. And I'm fine with that being four hours. On Sunday, I demoed Do in the Freeplay area because we were full and there were still players waiting. And I ran Leverage at 4-6, telling people up-front that I only had around two hours of game in me, and then after we finished character creation, that we'd end on a cliffhanger.<br/><br/>The Do games were fantastic. Daniel emailed me some advice for running the con scenario that made the game just delightful. Mythender was fantastic -- Lily, Logan &amp; Nora ended Yggdrasil, which is the first time anyone has ever decided to fight the World Tree. And the Leverage game was a hoot -- it was in a steampunk 1880's Paris, and the PCs want to steal the Lourve. (No small feat, since it's also an airship and well-armed against pirates.) All in all, a rather fine PAX.<br/><br/>I also got to try the Resistance, which I had been curious about. It was soooooo not my game, so I'm glad I didn't impulse buy it like I almost did a couple weeks back. But, still, always good to try new stuff, even when you don't like it.<br/><br/>I bought a couple of Jake Richmond's games, Ocean &amp; Girl x Boy. I haven't read them yet -- I used the flight home to read Shelter in Place and Remnants. I also bought some Iron Dice, mainly so I have some new Mythic Dice for Mythender.<br/><br/>Regarding GoD:<br/><br/>The one thing I would say: even if they're our friends, we should tell people busting out board games to play elsewhere. (This includes when I introduced people to Escape from the Aliens of Outer Space, but I wasn't aware of the impact until later.) It tells people poking their heads in that this space is cool for that when the tables should always be for our RPGs. <br/><br/>Also, the Mythender game was pre-arranged, and was in an awkward time for the room, but I hope that that wasn't a detriment. It's something I'll be aware of in the future, for sure. I took a table that wasn't used at the 12-2 slot at 1, and ran until 5, thus taking the table for the 2-4 and 4-6 slot. Next time, I'll not do that.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340969">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mease19" title="mease19"><img alt="mease19" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/142/nR3YP3SUMFGJA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mease19">mease19</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340969/#Comment_340969" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-30T12:42:16+00:00" title="August 30, 2011 12:42PM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Are there expenses for GoD?

Similar to Gen Con, there was usually a Fiasco game or two running in each slot, but it seemed like it wasn't quite as skewed this time around.

So next year, it's more than likely that the indie games room from what I understand will likely have much more room to stretch it's legs.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso if someone wants to hit me up with a pm that usually runs the booth/room (looking at you Sage) I would love to work with the indie game guys to help make a banner.
