A potential participant's understanding of the theory and facility with the accompanying jargon signifies her willingness to apply herself to learn the basis of discussion.  It shows that she is really interested and committed to spending time and effort to understand.  It also serves as a throttle for the number of participants in the discussion: it winnows out the folks with only casual interest and leaves only those who want it enough to work through it.  And let's face it: if you can come to a functional understanding of something as convoluted as the Big Model and all its accompanying terms, you can probably come to a functional understanding of what other people are talking about in this or that thread.<br/><br/>Now that said, I think it's important to point out that an understanding of Forge jargon is almost certainly not supposed to be the gatekeeper for participation here at Story Games.  Further, I don't think it has been -- although I may be mistaken and some folks have felt shooed off of SG because they don't speak Forge.  That would be a shame.  I have, however, been rather confused why there's been all this jargon talk here on SG, which has never, to my mind, been about game theory or throwing jargon around.  It's like SG is talking about the Forge's standards as if they were the standards of SG, which seems... off.<br/><br/>So: have people felt that they needed to be Forge-fluent to participate here?  Can anybody find some threads where this was the case (preferably not the threads <em>about</em> jargon)?  Or was this last week just a well-executed troll that got everybody in a tizzy?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69252/#Comment_69252" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-15T11:04:27+00:00" title="May 15, 2007 11:04AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Been reading Shirky?<br/><br/>I am pretty sure that some Forge-fluency is necessary to feel included in design conversations here.

(see response to John Kim)<br/><br/>Whether or not it's rude to ask vocabulary clarification in a thread is probably more a personal preference than anything else.  I find it distracting, especially since in my experience the 'simple question' usually sparks debate that overshadows the original post.  Your mileage, however, may vary.<br/><br/>John Kim:<br/>The answer, John, is yes.  Not because Chad and everybody else sucks, but because a specific game design community may want to explore and develop a specific way of designing games.  Part of that may include lots of theory communicated through jargon.  That doesn't mean that Chad's games are of lower quality; it just means that Chad's games are not designed according to the methods of that community.

Your first post only talked about weeding out people who have only a casual interest in game design.  I think it's important to understand that you're also weeding out lots of people who are serious about game design and discussing it, and are producing new, independent, non-traditional games.  <br/><br/>My request is that we need to be clear about this.  If, say, half the members of a community think that they would like to have discussions with such designers -- and the other half are trying to exclude them because their methods don't fit -- then that's a lousy social environment.  If the group is going to exclude people, they should know that they're being excluded and for what reason.  <br/><br/>It's like my <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=3029&amp;page=2#Item_4" rel="nofollow"><b>comment on the Forge Language thread</b></a> -- the question is who is the community and what are the standards for inclusion?  I don't want to mess with other people's community.  I was commenting because I felt that as someone who posts and discusses here, I thought that I was a member.  <br/><br/>So, for example, a policy statement along with the purpose of the forum would be a good way to express this.  If there is agreement to adopt such a policy, I would certainly follow it.  Conversely, though, if the community does not agree on such a policy (by whatever means), then people should adjust their expectations appropriately.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69718/#Comment_69718" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T12:33:10+00:00" title="May 16, 2007 12:33PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Rob, I am not telling anybody to leave; I'm saying that diction informs group identity, and that's not a bad thing.

Sorry; here's me trying to unpack it:  An online community devoted to game design is going to develop a certain way it goes about designing games.  This may be founded on some sort of theory with jargon (the other alternative being founded on unspoken assumptions).  People who want to join that community and participate in discussions about game design will need to make themselves fluent in the theory and jargon that the community uses (or come to a functional understanding of the unspoken assumptions).<br/><br/>And, again, since SG is not an online community devoted to game design, but an online community devoted to game playing, applying the barrier-to-entry of the Forge's Big Model vocabulary to participating at Story Games is kind of totally backwards thinking.<br/><br/>At this point, I'm wondering why we're talking about this here, anyway.

I think that a community can be broad enough to encompass members who have different methods of designing games.  Indeed, I think that one of the strengths of having such a community is learning from people who do things differently than you.  There will still be some jargon and shared assumptions, but they can be much broader than everyone accepting a particular theory and/or having a particular approach to design.  That's a general principle, though.

That is a forum policy and/or community decision, I think.  <br/><br/>However, <i>if</i> it is not knowledge of theory jargon is not expected, it means that it's a valid question to ask what you mean by it.  So if you use theory jargon, then you should be prepared to explain it or rephrase your point -- regardless of whether the term comes from the Forge, from the Knutepunkt books, from rec.games.frp.advocacy, or from any other source.  For example, if I talk about Fate-play and the Cage or Jeepform, then I might have to explain it.  If there is a clear and coherent summary that defines the word, then it should be OK.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray" title="Adam_Dray"><img alt="Adam_Dray" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/445/n8DFU0XP50I1V.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Adam_Dray">Adam_Dray</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69801/#Comment_69801" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T15:21:24+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  3:21PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jargon is a way of thinking.

So we need common ground.<br/><br/>Everyone brings their own jargon to the table, even the people claiming they always write in plain English. C'mon, you're using jargon too and not everyone is going to understand you all the time.<br/><br/>Can't we reach some kind of kindergarten consensus along the lines of "can't we just all get along?" The "just" is misleading, I know. "Just" getting along means everyone being a little more patient and trying a little harder to communicate in a friendly way. That means using less jargon when possible. That means being friendly and inclusive of people who don't know your jargon. That means explaining your jargon when people ask. That means not being afraid to ask when you don't understand some jargon, even if it's in a whisper or another side-thread. That means not freaking out when someone asks you to clarify jargon in your threads, even if you have to link to a new thread to answer them to preserve your threads sacred threadness. <br/><br/>Does it really take a week once or twice a year to figure out that we should be excellent to each other?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69803">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69803/#Comment_69803" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T15:32:27+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  3:32PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jargon is, in practice, always a gatekeeper.<br/><br/>That's why we need to keep sneaking people in past it.

SG at that point is just for fluffy Awesome-chat and the like, as far as I'm concerned.</blockquote>\nHere's the thing, and it's kinda something I've been thinking about a lot in regards to two recent things that happened (aside from the recent derth of theory/Forge social environ threads). This place was never meant to be The Forge Part II. I wanted to avoid turning these forums into "The Place to Discuss Theory Now that the Theory Forums on the Forge are Closed". Theory, Design and "Process" (? Do you mean, "How to sell your game?"). SG's point was always about fluffy, as well as substantive, chat about "Awesome".  Awesome here being general game chat, focused discussion on tips and tricks to make games in general or specific games more fun. <br/><br/>I even allow room for discussion of game design, most recently adding a category for it. But again, this place was never meant to focus on it.  It was mainly a place where people who post here, who also happened to be working on a game, might go to get some directed advice. I put in the forum rules thread that this is not the place for ground-up game design, instead pointing people elsewhere.<br/><br/>I love the works that came out of the Forge. I love the relationships I made from interacting with people there. The idea for this forum comes from the Forge Birthday Forum.  But this was never meant to be the place to Discuss Theory.<br/><br/>I've made it clear before that the only "theory" that works here is theory that applies to running or playing in games. Practical stuff to make gaming more fun. GNS and other Forge theory (which I don't want to distance myself from, because I use some of it) is primarily meant for the game designer, not the player. It's stuff to be used in conjunction with critical thought about game design. In other words, it really has no place here.<br/><br/>I'm a really lenient moderator, though, and have allowed discussions on things like "Sim" to go on, but mostly because out of those "jargon using" threads, I could see where they were applying it to running actual game sessions. See the James Bond 007 splinter thread frex. Also, as John Kim pointed out there's been a rash of jargon-heavy threads here and there this last week. Again, my moderation style is more "let the fire burn itself out" rather than "stomp my foot down when things fall outside the lines". <br/><br/>Since I've seen the wave wind down, I've had no need to bring my foot down and say "no more Forge Theory for a while" or anything like that, but the last two days I've been thinking about that. Also, been thinking about how to "bookend" the wave with a discussion letting people know the "forum stance" on theory and jargon and the like.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, what I want to make very clear is that this is a place to discuss game <b>playing</b> first and foremost. Not game design. Theory and jargon used to discuss game playing is... acceptable. But as I mention in the rules thread, I require such discussions to tie their jargon to the acts of play, otherwise it doesn't fly here. I've had to kill discussions here in the past because people were talking about high concept theory that they really couldn't explain in terms of actual play, "dice hit the table" examples. This is not the kind of place for that kinds of discussion. <br/><br/>The two aforementioned things that happened, BTW, that got me thinking about clearly restating the goals of S-G in that rules thread:<br/><br/>1) A lot of people have been joining lately with variations of the following "join message":<br/>"Hi! I found this place after a discussion on (SITE). I'm interested in roleplaying game design, and am working on my own game!"<br/>Which is great, I like to see more people and all that... but joining S-G 'for the game design' is kinda worrysome, because the main purpose of the site was clearly not for game design or game design discussion. They happen from time to time, but they're more of a byproduct of other discussions. The discussion of GamePLAY (also: Enthusiasm and Fluff) hasn't been subverted by design discussion or anything like that (yet), but I really don't want to give people the wrong impression. This isn't a place to come and:<br/>* Talk about game design<br/>* Promote your product <br/>...UNLESS you've come here to talk about Other Stuff, too.<br/><br/>2) Not related to the above theory, but shows how people might be misled by the (IMO) clearly stated goals of the site before joining:<br/>Recently, there was about 2 weeks where I saw a number of members join with the following "join message"<br/>"Hi, I found out about this site from the RPGNet discussion about Other Gaming Sites. I came here because of RPGNet's shitty decision about segmenting d20 discussion".<br/>...which really throws me for a loop, because this place is totally more iron-fisted totalitarian that RPGNet could ever be. Over there, they tend to seek group consensus and the like, or at least try to make popular decisions. Here, this entire forum is essentially "Andy's Playhouse", and I've made no effort to obfuscate the fact that I will pretty much do whatever the hell appeals to <i>me</i>, as narcissistic as that sounds. So this is essentially way more totalitarian or subject to bizarre rule. :-)<br/>Also, the idea that people were coming here (a place where I try to murder bitterness in the face) because they were bitter about a decision, again felt a little weird.<br/>But again, nothing bad has happened, yet. And interesting new people have been enthusiastically participating, so that all rocks. But I don't want to mislead people.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Joshua BishopRoby</cite>First off: this might be a good thread to split of, "Theory and Jargon on Story Games."  Or that could be a<em>terrible, terrible</em>idea.  Not sure.  Andy?</blockquote>\nI'm split on the idea. Eventually I'll have to clarify the Story Games stance on theory, and my stance on jargon in general. Maybe. In any case, I'm hoping that the above suffices for now:<br/><br/>This place is about game play discussion, focused on small press games and mainstream games run more collaboratively (or for lack of a better word, more "Story Game-ish"). It is also about the enthusiastic discussion of games and developments in the scene. Other discussion, like "ground-up game design" is also welcome, but it takes second seat to the above. If it starts driving the forums too much, then I'll step in to correct it.<br/><br/>Jargon: Jargon itself is not bad. However, jargon discussions related to GNS, The Big Model and general theory, including clarification, really doesn't have much of a place here at all. There are FAR better places to discuss it: Namely "I Would Knife Fight A Man", Mendel's Theory Roundup, Jhkim's Livejournal (great read, BTW), and if you actually tie it to play, then the best place is the Forge's Actual Play forum. Or if you tie it to your own game design, then the First Thoughts forum. Again, this place was never meant to take the place of the now-closed Theory and GNS forums, or turn it into a "Forge II", in terms of creating a support network for game designers. So jargon use should keep that in mind. Other than that, I probably will not create Rules of Engagement for jargon use, or make lists of what's "In" or "Out".<br/><br/>Hopefully that makes sense.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69852/#Comment_69852" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T18:06:39+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  6:06PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Also, I realized that a great deal of what I wrote above parrots what JBR said in his first post:\n<blockquote>Now that said, I think it's important to point out that an understanding of Forge jargon is almost certainly not supposed to be the gatekeeper for participation here at Story Games.

This wasn't intended as proof of a problem, but just to answer JBR's question from the OP and point out that the people who started talking about jargon weren't coming out of nowhere. <br/><br/>The clumping of threads could just be a statistical outlier.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69859">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69859/#Comment_69859" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-16T18:23:37+00:00" title="May 16, 2007  6:23PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jhkim</cite><br/>The clumping of threads could just be a statistical outlier.</blockquote>\n...is what I'm thinking it most likely is, too.

That seems pretty clear from Andy's guidelines. At least I think that I've been good in that I haven't maneuvered any threads to theory discussions per se. I certainly haven't started any theory discussions here. In fact, I queried around and found Levi's site, just in order to find a more design-oriented site than this one. Understanding that design is also not a goal of this place.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhere I've been guilty is in participating with theory threads that have popped up. My thoughts when such have popped up have been like, "Oh, hey, theory discussion, cool! And... Andy's not shutting it down. So it must be kosher."<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, I should also know that it's not Andy's style to come into a thread and say, "That's verboten here!" It seems to me that he wants openness, and would rather that the "No Theory" thing be a gestalt. But if that's the case, then, as people point out above, you're going to get waves of theory talk. Just as you get waves of "Awsemofy" talk.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut if Andy wants to say, "Hey, in the name of making this a more casual place, and one that alienates people as little as possible so as to increase inclusiveness, let's not talk theory much, if at all" I certainly can respect that. And I think others would, too. As people say, there certainly still is a place available for such discussions, The Forge.<br/>\n<br/>\nAndy, if you want people to help you out with this, helping you to curb theory discussions, and such, please say so. If you want standards, somebody has to be there to at least remind people about them, if not outright enforce them. If "Let's not use potentially alienating jargon" is a standard around here, or "let's not talk theory in depth" then let's enforce it. If you've indicated that we should be doing so before, and I missed it, then I for one am all apologies.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis needs a little leadership, something you've done pretty well with so far at this site. If you leave it to we Forge transplants to set up the social standards, it's very likely that we'll fall back on what we're used to from the Forge. If that's not what you want, then you may have to reiterate that once in a while. And damn any Forgie who thinks its restrictive. Just as Ron set up his standards on The Forge to make it a functional arena for discussion.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's funny, but Mike Sugarbaker keeps on citing the "A Group Is It's Own Worst Enemy" article, I think with some particular idea of how it will illuminate the problems here. But all I get from reading it is that to make a forum functional, a small group of people (perhaps one), has to take charge of upholding standards. Which seems pretty obvious, in retrospect. Even if that goal is to keep the conversation casual.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_69940">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/D-503" title="D-503"><img alt="D-503" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/D-503">D-503</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69940/#Comment_69940" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T05:56:17+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  5:56AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, sorry if my request for help on rpg.net has fallen foul of all this, I'm afraid I simply thought "where do I know there are helpful theory people hanging out who can help with this?" and I thought SG.<br><br>It's just coincidence, this is the only forum I post in that has people who know theory stuff at all well, hence here is where I asked.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_69946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W" title="Mark W"><img alt="Mark W" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark%20W">Mark W</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/69946/#Comment_69946" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-17T06:23:52+00:00" title="May 17, 2007  6:23AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, just to be clear...

There has been several talks here in Story Games and elsewhere about the use of jargon, a lot of it pretty incendiary. One of the main points in those discussion is whether jargon works as a gatekeeper, avoiding people from joining the discussion. It's quite clear by now there is not going to be a consensus about it. However, what is quite clear to me is that discussions about jargon are keeping a lot of people away from joining the community.<br><br>Clearly, these aren't discussions about theory but rather of meta-theory, if they're actually propositive, or just plain old flame wars. For those that really worry about making theory and design discussions welcoming and available to newcomers, this specific topic should stop.  A lot of times, it seems the barriers of respect, constructive criticism and name-calling are being broken. I'm saying all of this because I'm a newcomer and I don't really feel welcome coming in the middle of this fight. It's quite clear, even to a newcomer like myself, that there is a lot of bad blood between members of this forum, and, sadly, even with people not within this community that are usually the target of calumnies or verbal abuse. It's also clear that these jargon discussions are used as a cover to carry out this grievances in public, rather than in private. <br><br>Maybe I'm completely wrong, but that is the impression you're giving to outsiders. The same impression, or worse, that some of the posters here claim the use of jargon is causing. I don't think closing theory discussions will solve things, since the emotions (and emotional arguments) created by these discussions are a symptom of something else. Something you, as a community, should try to consider.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_70163">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70163/#Comment_70163" name="Item_42" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T09:00:54+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:00AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I understand your opinion. Interestingly I think that there's actually less grievances than you percieve. That's not to invalidate your perception, and the damage is probably surely done that you claim. It's just that we tend to all get along rather well as long as we're not discussing what's allowed to be discussed.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn addition to it not be efficatious, closing the discussions like this would serve only to disenfranchise those who are feeling put out. They need to be heard.<br/>\n<br/>\nShould these discussions be held with less rancor? Yeah. Is that likely? Well we can hope.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem is that each side sees in the other ill will at some point in these discussions. Never directly, so each side sees the other as making veiled accusations. Then they escalate to unveiled counter-accusations. It's hard to not reply when you feel that somebody is getting away with impugning one's good name.<br/>\n<br/>\nHopefully this is an artifact of the limitations of written communication. I think that if these arguments were being had face to face that the acrimony would not appear. That nobody is really being nasty to anyone else, and just voicing concerns about the other side's goals.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut we'll see.<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_70170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/70170/#Comment_70170" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-18T09:20:00+00:00" title="May 18, 2007  9:20AM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Folks, as has been pointed out about five times in this thread now, much of this discussion isn't about story games at all, and just about everybody in this thread has agreed that jargon-heavy talk isn't incredibly appropriate on these boards.
