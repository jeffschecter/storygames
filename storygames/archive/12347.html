Oh yeah, it was brought. \xa0My brief notes on the awesome for me from this weekend:<br/>I didn't sign up for anything on the forums, trusting that there would be a surplus of great gaming. \xa0As always, this expectation was met and exceeded. \xa0I played a host of games that I'd either been wanting to try, or were entirely new to me. \xa0Fiasco, A Taste For Murder, Ribbon Drive, Norwegian Style short form, Love in the Time of Seid, I'm still chewing over the experiences, but those were some rich and rewarding games to try.<br/><br/>I also set out to facilitate games this con, which I'll admit was a little intimidating. \xa0But I was quite pleased to get full sign-in sheets for both A Taste For Murder and Serial Homicide Unit on Saturday morning. \xa0There may have been some hiccups due to the inexperienced facilitator, but I really enjoyed those games and look forward to running more games next year.(Level up!)<br/><br/>I really dig the friendly atmosphere and camaraderie of such a large group getting together, all taking responsibility for their own and other's experience. \xa0The con organizers might want to try to be a little less awesome, lest they become the target of a scrappy band of Mythenders!<br/><br/>I left early on Sunday, but that was to spend a wonderful Father's day with my daughter, so that is also a win for me!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277062">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack" title="amnesiack"><img alt="amnesiack" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1012/830711303_f5d26761f6_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/amnesiack">amnesiack</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277062/#Comment_277062" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T08:11:51+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  8:11AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It was great!<br/><br/>I played...<br/><br/>Mist Robed Gate: The Fall of Atlantis<br/>Geiger Counter: <a href="http://www.ichorfalls.com" rel="nofollow">Ichor Falls</a><br/>Minions (Apocalypse World hack)<br/>Dominion<br/>Auntie Maim (British school girls uncovering horrible doings in the care of a distant relative)<br/>Freemarket<br/><br/>My friend Andy and I also snuck in some playtesting of our roller derby board game idea that we'd started on 2 days before the start of the convention.<br/><br/>Every game was fun.

Of course, there were tons of games I wished I'd gotten to play, and tons of people I wish I'd gotten to play/visit with, but it was still a very satisfying weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/rafial" title="rafial"><img alt="rafial" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/rafial">rafial</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277089/#Comment_277089" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T10:34:03+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 10:34AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2010 11:37AM by rafial.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it was "Go Play D&amp;D", as I managed to play or run four distinct different and wonderful types of D&amp;D.<br/><br/>1) Jonathan Tweet's early stage "Indie D&amp;D", which couples very cut down d20 style mechanics (interestingly jiggered so the DM never rolls any dice) to an OD&amp;D ethic, along with some collaborative world building elements (only one person can play each class, and you are in charge of developing the color surrounding your class).<br/><br/>2) Tony Dowler's Apocalypse D&amp;D, which is a sweet merge of AD&amp;D with the Apocalypse World "roll to see how many things you get to pick from a list" mechanic.  Lots of a fun, produces a nice gonzo, pulpy feel.  Reminded me of a more structured T&amp;T.<br/><br/>3) I GM'd "The Spire of Iron &amp; Crystal", a tournament module for Swords &amp; Wizardry, which is a straight up OD&amp;D clone.  The party got to play around in a weird science-fantasy wizard's tower, with strange furry snake-rats that could swim through crystal (and liked to be sung to when they weren't chewing off your leg), a crystalline tree that almost turned the thief into fertilizer, and mysterious teleport pads that split the party.  I had a great time, and the players seemed to as well!<br/><br/>4) D&amp;D 4e, using Lee Short's (soon to be published) Dungeon Construction Kit. DCK enables "pick up and play" 4e, by using decks of cards, map tiles and an encounter book, as well as rules to allow the players to pick their risk/reward ratio.  It produces very satisfying encounter based play, and could be used in a rotating GM format to let everybody at the table get in on the action. I'm very excited to see this reach finished form.<br/><br/>I also played in another Lee Short demo/playtest, of his Tarot based Amber game.  The Tarot is used both for generating situation, as well as conflict resolution, where the nature of the cards being played help drive the fiction, in a very interesting "Nine Worlds meets Everway" kind of way.  My impression is that it would make for some great long form, slow burn play, and I'm interested to see how it develops.<br/><br/>Oh, and how could I forget! Johnzo Aegard powered Danger Patrol, in which D4N-G3R, Prototype Automated Patrol Unit; Steve Gogetter, The Most Interesting Alien in the Solar System; and Colonel Tommy Eidolon, Ghost Explorer saved the Solar Regatta, and prevented System-wide war between the ever suspicious Crimson Empire and the insidious Venusian separatist forces of M.E.D.U.S.A.  We never /did/ figure out what M.E.D.U.S.A. stood for though.<br/><br/>Overall, a fantastic weekend as always. Kudos to Ping &amp; her subalterns for enabling GPNW to level up year after year!<br/><br/>Oh, and photos: <a href="http://bit.ly/cgbuam" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/cgbuam</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277096">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277096/#Comment_277096" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T10:54:41+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 10:54AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Too devoured for details this soon.  But in short it was an amazing weekend.<br/><br/>I facilitated Fiasco, Danger Patrol, and two games of Love in the Time of Sei\xf0.  Also played Geiger Counter and a two-slot Apocalypse World game.  All good stuff.<br/><br/>As fun as the games were, the people make GPNW really special.  Such wonderful players and improvisers.

(I'll email you, Joel)<br/><br/>Too short a sesh of Mars Colony... I immediately got why Ben is so excited about it. This game is rad!<br/><br/>Being horrible with my roach-homies. Uh, no, steve, my guy totally guns down quadriplegic burn victims without being roached. If she wins NASCAR, satan will come back to earth! I'm doing this for humanity, and for the fans!<br/><br/>Playing Love in the time of Seid was the second most affecting play experience of the con, and super wonderful. Matthijs &amp; Jason's game partnered with Matthew's very clear presentation opened the gates for a wonderful session with two Matthews, a Blake and a Joel. In particular, Blake's portrayal of the ageing king will stay with me for quite some time. <br/><br/>The last two slots on sunday were spent playing through a game model of mine. It was perhaps the most enjoyable play of that game thusfar; much thanks to Daniel for requesting it, and to Joe and Andy for rising to the occasion. Deep apologies to David- we thought we'd be done way earlier and kept him waiting for a dreamed-of playtest of something Andy's been cobbling together, which never quite came. <br/><br/>A wonderful weekend, and the best pseudo-bachelor-party that one could ask for.

I've already forgotten all their names, but I could tell you who their characters were.  *grin* <br/><br/>Anyway, here's my final list.<br/><br/>Mountain Witch - I'd been aching to play this forever.  James Brown was a fantastic GM - things were suitably creepy and awesome.<br/><br/>Fiasco x2 - I finally played Fiasco!  We did the Gangster London set and the Suburban set.  Both were ... messy.  The game had a lot of potential, I knew that from reading it, but seeing it in action was even better.  <br/><br/>Freemarket - Mechanically, it took actually sitting down and playing with all the cards to make it click.  Which it did.  Click, I mean.  Luke and Jared - get that boxed set out!  I want to play again.<br/><br/>Sage's Old Mesilla Lady Blackbird Hack - This one was pretty fun - it was the last slot on Saturday and I think we were all a little tired and delirious.  The game FLEW by as we more or less just rushed to the end of it.  Even so, I got to be a surly mexican priest.  Saturday was silly-accents day.<br/><br/>Shock - Another one I'd been waiting ages to play.  Everyone was so into it.  We managed the downfall of the entire human race, save one lone survivor, trapped in the clutches of the Europan virus.<br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow - After my first game with my local group, I thought I'd re-run this at GPNW.  I think that with a firmer idea of the mechanics and a push towards pacing the game a little differently we really made it sing.<br/><br/>All in all, a fantastic time.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277125">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277125/#Comment_277125" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T12:45:13+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 12:45PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man. I played two games and facilitated 4 more, playing something in every slot but Sunday AM. I'm exhausted.<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>Meeting new people! Seemed like most of the new people I met were from Massachusetts or Vancouver/Victoria, and they were all awesome.<br/><br/>Apocalypse D&amp;D. I played it Saturday morning, then pestered Tony into giving me his notes and draft version so I could run it for others. Ran it twice, the game with Jackson and Ben was particularly memorable. The second time I ran it was the last time slot, with players who were slightly less enthused about classic D&amp;D (one of them had never even played D&amp;D!), but it was still a good time.<br/><br/>Having people enjoy my hack. I brought my Lady Hackbird western game, Old Mesilla, and it worked out pretty well both times I ran it. Just having people be psyched about something I put together is a cool feeling, and I had a great time both times.<br/><br/><br/>There was some not so awesome as well. Played Mars Colony, but it didn't click for me at all. I ran Mouse Guard Sunday afternoon, and it fell pretty flat. Not bad, but kind of a let down after some of the other games I ran/played.<br/><br/>I also developed a really bad habit of getting faster and faster as a GM. Like Adam mentioned, Old Mesilla flew by the second time, AD&amp;D had the same problem second time around. Oh well, thanks to everyone I played with!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277129">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/johnzo" title="johnzo"><img alt="johnzo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/125/n117PCSMDAAPJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/johnzo">johnzo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277129/#Comment_277129" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T13:08:45+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  1:08PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 24, 2010 1:14PM by johnzo.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            FRI-01:In Fiasco, Matthew S-B fell in with the wrong crowd at Narc-Anon when he sponsored Gagan, who stole his mason jar of Confederate gold coins.  Gagan did quite well for himself as a prosperity gospel preacher in the aftermath; that reincorporating little creep stole all the inspirational speeches that my sweetly maternal madam made during the game.  As for me, the insurance wouldn't pay out and in the end, I couldn't even get a job at the movie theater.  Eric Logan's brothel-mopper suffered worst, though, when the Roosterman made him into the new Little Peep.<br/><br/>SAT-01: Geiger Counter: Ichor Falls, I started as a mere shift supervisor at the Ichor Falls call center, but I didn't look back when I was offered a full manager role in the call center of the Menace.  You give me an endless supply of burning Amish child-slaves, and I guarantee you, I will push your metrics SKY FUCKING HIGH.<br/><br/>SAT-02: In Danger Patrol, the D4N-G3R prototype multitasked the ladies.  His head would chat them up at the bar while his body busted leading-edge moves on the floor.  Erstwhile lavender alien Steve Gogetter Cyrano'd him through this, while Colonel Tommy Eidolon was off doing real work, decoding the enigmatic Stygians' plans for the solar system...<br/><br/>SAT-03: Fiasco II, which I think fizzled a bit due to a setup that made two cards address an identical situation.  We had one pair with a Need to get laid right now by anyone and another pair with a Need to get away from a former lover. We collapsed these situations and effectively moved them between the same pair of players, cutting a card away from a third player and leaving only a weak McGuffin as a central conflict point.   <br/><br/>I find that Fiasco is an extremely challenging game to play well, its setup doesn't take the table nearly as far as the setup for other oracular games like In A Wicked Age, and so you gotta be good at engineering the situation.<br/><br/>SAT-04: NASCAR Roach. Jackson was the finest beat poet that the world of stock car racing had ever seen, but he did not serve the Master, so at the season-ending awards banquet, I cut him into little pieces and fed him to David Hasselhoff, who had been crucified inverted for the occasion.  It is not easy to serve two gods, but Johan Skorpion, the Fastest Kraut in NASCAR, did his best.<br/><br/>SUN-01: Scandihoovian shorts with Chris Bennett.  We rocked <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">I Didn't Do It</span> It Wasn't Me for a couple hours.  Dolly Parton's death brought many, many things to light, but no one was surprised when it turned out that Chris, her plastic surgeon, brought about her death because he was crumbling under the workload she required of him.<br/><br/>SUN-02: IAWA.  Jem smashed Steve's dark altar and became the oasis god; Charlton, who wanted to sleep with Jem, got mopey and wrote poems.  Blake switched sides about a dozen times, and in the end was torn apart by the spirits of those he'd wronged.<br/><br/>SUN-03: Montsegur.  As always I could write a book about this.  I think I want to codify a few rules tweaks to get the Cathar stuff out earlier, because people really stumbled with it.  I believe the long description of Montsegur could be simplified and replaced with a tight paragraph, and the cathar reading moved in earlier. <br/><br/>These are just quibbles.  The actual play was white-hot and proved the game's considerable replay value to me.  Here's everyone's fates:<br/><br/>Bernard was put into a coma during an Act II sortie.  His page Amiel sat vigil over him -- until a scene in Act III when the gallant knight suddenly sat upright and spoke in the voice of God that they all must flee, flee, flee.  And then he died, but his corpse did not rot.  <br/><br/>Phillipa starved herself while trying to nurse petit-Esclarmonde, her infant daughter, over the winter.  <br/><br/>Esclarmonde passed the baby onto Arsende, who was also pregnant, hoping that Arsende could nurse.  Arsende's pleas for mercy were rejected by the Count of Toulouse and she was burned.<br/><br/>Garnier and Esclarmonde tried to escape.  Garnier claimed it, leaving Esclarmonde to burn.<br/><br/>Bertrand feuded with Amiel all game, then just walked right onto the pyre at the end.<br/><br/>Amiel was dragged away from Bernard's corpse by Crusaders.  He tried to recant, but he was incoherent, and he burned.  <br/><br/>Pierre Roger, murderer of the Inquisitor, didn't get much of a trial before he burned.  Neither did Raimonde.<br/><br/>Cecile, desperate to die before her Perfection was tarnished, had tried to lead the female Believers down to early judgment at the end of Act II, but the Crusaders just laughed at her and sent her back up, telling her that didn't want Montsegur's pagan hags -- they wanted its gold.

Picked up a game of <i>Lady Blackbird</i> in 04, with a ton of excellent players whose names I canna recall.  I played Kale Arkam hard toward his Key of Fraternity with the Captain, only to buy it off when Vance turncoated back to the Imperials just as we were about to get out of the Hand of Sorrow scot-free.  I replaced it with Key of the Sky Pirate and went all the way down the slide into murderous badassery.  We ended on Nightport with me selling a captive Imperial Captain into sexual slavery after shattering her knee, the Owl's engines in flames, me and Snargle's asses fired by a disgusted Lady Blackbird.  Fun as hell.<br/><br/>Sunday morning I played <i>Love in the Time of Sei\xf0</i>, run by Matthew Gagan, accompanied by Joel Shempert, Jackson Tegu, and (I think) Matthew Sullivan-Barrett.  Awesome, <i>awesome</i> Norse blood opera.  Joel did a fantastic job of portraying the slithery sexual Sei\xf0kona, the spider at the heart of all the plot-spinning, the realization of which left my guilt-ridden King Einar with no choice but to slay her in a final act of despair.  I think the Jarl had the most challenging role, since he was the outsider with the Baron Harkonnen appearance.  It was hard for Matthew S-B to generate the kind of trust that should inform treachery.  He did a great job, as did all the others.  Jackson's princess worked the sweet spot between dutiful and rebellious, tearing the King's heart apart.  And Matthew Gagan made the Knight a tormented, lost soul who perceived his folly in the moment before he was torn apart by an enraged bear.<br/><br/>Sunday afternoon was IAWA with Johnzo, another blood opera using the God-Kings of War Oracle.  My war-sorceress Sethirae (or whatever her name was) got her ass handed to her early in a conflict with the gore-stained priest of the wasteland devil dogs, and resorted thereafter to playing everyone against each other, and yes, shifting her loyalties to fit the circumstances of the moment.  What a killer game.  I only regret I didn't have much creative juice left in me by the end of it.  But hey, I got to witness the apotheosis of another character while having my magical strength broken at the altar.<br/><br/>Kudos to the organizers and everyone who made it such a fantastic weekend.  <i>Everyone</i> made it a fantastic weekend.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277170">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o" title="Hans_c-o"><img alt="Hans_c-o" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/032/nLMGWULBRC6BR.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hans_c-o">Hans_c-o</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277170/#Comment_277170" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T17:15:59+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  5:15PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I stayed home &amp; picked up the freebie Dark Sun adventure, so there!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme" title="nemomeme"><img alt="nemomeme" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://static.flickr.com/113/314528553_7da59997f4_o.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/nemomeme">nemomeme</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277175/#Comment_277175" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T17:38:31+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  5:38PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2010 5:49PM by nemomeme.">edited June 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: johnzo</cite>FRI-01:In Fiasco, Matthew S-B fell in with the wrong crowd at Narc-Anon when he sponsored Gagan, who stole his mason jar of Confederate gold coins.

I was grossly obese, soft spoken, apologetic, and read peoples minds by shoving my deformed hand in their mouth. I was filled full of bullets after brain puppeting my skinner friend to keep him/her from preventing me from killing a baby. An eeevil baby.  <br/><br/>* Playing the Dreaming Crucible with Mickey and Joel Saturday afternoon. The Dreaming Crucible does "child journeys to magical land and confronts what is there as metaphor for the journey from childhood to adulthood" as well as anything. It's Oz-tastic.<br/><br/>* Playing Freemarket Saturday night with Peter Adkison and Johnathan Tweet and two other lovely people who's names I've forgotten and who hope will forgive me. I fulfilled a lifelong dream by playing a hard living, Lester Bangs-esque critic who was part of a guerrilla public relations MRCZ. We infiltrated an juried art competition, and humiliated a rival by convincing her that a particularly good chicken tandoori was really an avant guarde piece of installation art. Tragically, though, we failed at promoting the tandoori restaurant that produced it and got the owner really mad. <br/><br/>*  Playing Jeepform games on Sunday morning, particularily the kind of moving alien contact game "The Believers".<br/><br/>*Running the first play test of my 'Series of Unfortunate Events' homage game, Auntie Maim, and having the game not burst into flames. Children were yelled at, manipulated, locked in dungeons and even fed haggis (Horrors!) before they turned the tables on their tormentor and burned/ exorcized / beat them to death with a field hokey stick. <br/><br/>* Minions on Sunday Night. In minions, you play employees of a supervillan who are mostly in it for the dental plan and the paid vacation, trying to succeed/ not succeed at advancing their employers plans to take over the world. We stole pure unobtanium from the Keebler compound, which is shaped like a hollow tree. Our antagonist (don't call them villians!) had a New England Village in a glass dome that flies around on helicopter wings. This game does a great job of taking a sort of gonzo premise and exploring its ramifications on people. It also allows for people to make up all sorts of Venture brothers goofiness.     <br/><br/>In short, GPNW was a freaking blast.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277193">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself" title="Benhimself"><img alt="Benhimself" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Benhimself">Benhimself</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277193/#Comment_277193" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T21:08:15+00:00" title="June 21, 2010  9:08PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Man. I wrote up the games I ran on the GPNW forum (Kingston! I had forgotten your real name. But yeah, you kicked ass in your portrayal of Pity, that brainer), but the other games that stuck out:<br/><br/>Danger Patrol! Thanks to Matthew Gagnon for running this one, and my copatrolers (David Hauth and Eric Boyd, I think?) for bringing it as well.  The Nemo postermap for the first encounter was kick-ass, as, of course, were the horrible machinations of Kor-mak the Time Flayer, and it was a good thing Tank Turbo (Intrepid Warrior), and THRX-99 (Robot Daredevil) were there to back up myself as Professor Explosion (Atomic Professor) in saving Neptune from the Chronos Kraken. <br/><br/>Apocalypse D&amp;D! The system's still a little rough around the edges, especially how experience is handled, but what wasn't rough around the edges was Tony Dowler's dungeons! Well, they were rough, but mostly for the PCs. The first game of it I played in, the Malevolent Jelly of Eyes and Mouths damn near wrecked us, and forced a panicked retreat followed by the grim realization that we had retreated in different directions, and in the second game, about half the party was done in when the wizard miscast fireball. You don't get much more classic than that.<br/><br/>All of the others!

I met a lot of new people, all of whom were friendly and welcoming, and I had a blast in every session I played. I had only two regrets: one, that I couldn't muster a little more energy for the games that I played on Sunday, and two, that I didn't have the time to eat at Plum Bistro or any of the other wonderful-looking places I'd been planning to visit. Oh, well - there's always next year.<br/><br/>Anyway, here's a quick rundown of everything I was able to play:\n<ul>\n<li>Two games of Fiasco with Charlton and Kristian, using the "Boomtown" and "Tales From Suburbia" playsets.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>My first game of Lacuna, with Carl running it and myself, David Hauth, Jeremy Tidwell, and Twyla. I had almost no prior knowledge of the game, which I think really enhanced the experience for me.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A nice long session of Apocalypse World with John Harper, Matthew Gagan, Ping, and Ryan Macklin.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A pickup game of Lady Blackbird, which Blake mentioned above. This was easily my favorite of the three times I've played it. I think the lineup was myself GMing, Blake as Kale, Eric as Vance (and later Natasha), Jordan as Snargle, and Doug as Naomi, and everyone was an absolute pleasure to play with.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A handful of short-form games with Darin, Susan, Kingston, Chris, and John, including The Believers, which I've been wanting to play for quite a while, and really enjoyed.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Several pickup games of Dominion.</li>\n</ul>\nAll in all, it was a really terrific weekend. Many thanks to all the friendly folks I met, everyone that I played with, and especially to the Hugo House and all the GPNW organizers for putting together such an amazing event!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277203">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros" title="Maedhros"><img alt="Maedhros" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Maedhros">Maedhros</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277203/#Comment_277203" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-21T23:11:53+00:00" title="June 21, 2010 11:11PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Tank Turbo, in a desperate attempt to protect his secret love Queen Zythia of Neptune, triggered a disaster and unleashed a pack of Sabotaged Robots!

Nobilis: I realized when facing down an Excrucian Warmain that I had given no thought at all to how my character would handle physical threats, so I pretty much got the heck out of the way.  IAWA: my strapping young deserter from the Thessalian army fell in love at once with the beautiful wild mage, but she was more interested in this shrine thing than in him, and his one big play to get her attention - a kiss, With Love and Directly, wound up giving *her* the advantage die, and so he wound up being completely thwarted; and once your love interest has ascended to goddesshood, what else is there to do *but* mope and write bad poetry?

Given what Lehman and Richmond are getting up to, I predict it won't be the last.<br/><br/>But GPNW, yeah! Spacerpunk was a blast. There is nothing like a party full of characters who are highly-motivated fuckups to make a game fire on all cylinders.<br/><br/>Geiger Counter was a good time once my brain got into gear. Scenes are harder to frame early on than they are later in the game when you have a bank of imagery and rolling events to draw from. I guess that applies to anything.<br/><br/>Gun Thief! Speaking of highly motivated fuckups, we created some more great ones. McDaldno seemed determined to make things rough for the Law by being the kind of criminal that just doesn't really get the message. I discovered a heretofore-unknown ability to <i>regulate some shit</i>. Good stuff.<br/><br/>Lottery ended in Fiasco. I mean the game Fiasco. Suburbia FTW. It feels like we didn't really get Devon tied in, which I feel badly about. <br/><br/>Took a shot at Mars Colony with Macklin on Sunday morning. We crashed and burned, maybe mostly because, well, Sunday morning. I'll have more to say about this one when we see the final product, but what struck me is how it embodies the liberal fallacy that people's feelings don't matter much to politics.<br/><br/>I had to bail on the Maid game due to some old buddies arriving mid-slot. I am sorry. Random tables have power and Maid embodies that in spades, but I find myself wishing we could have saved 15 minutes or so by just picking some shit.<br/><br/>Lastly, FreeMarket. See my Spacerpunk comment. How do you play a social-combat game set on a space station and still end up in a bar fight with moonshiners for your first challenge? It Happened To Me.<br/><br/>I didn't play much of anything for like three slots... and I'm not beating myself up about it. For one thing, at the end of Sunday night I was still up for convo and drinking when everyone else was hittin' the hay. We built all these games that fit into our lives better so we can play them more; why do we still work ourselves so hard at cons? <br/><br/>Anyway, great weekend.

"Highly motivated fuckups" is a very apt description.  I vaguely recall making a feedback note on my char sheet, intending to bring it up at the end of the slot -- then hurrying home to find stuff to take the next morning.  I don't actually remember what the comments were.  <br/><br/>Apoc D&amp;D: more good fun.  The system does "Classic D&amp;D dungeoncrawl" really well.  <br/><br/>Danger Patrol: short slot, so we just got a short taste.  There were really neat things about the system, though (the timers, the location system, the danger track ...), and we saw enough of it to get a feel for the game. For a table of total newbie players, that's pretty good progress.  <br/><br/>Swords and Wizardry:  Wilhelm does a great job at bringing the dungeon to life.  I really dig his descriptions of sounds and textures.  Science-fantasy isn't usually my thing, but this worked well.  <br/><br/>Amber Shadows (my own tarot-based system, set in Zelazny's Amber):  I'm usually a little reluctant to run this game in a short slot, but I'm glad I did.  The first hour of the slot was building the collectively-generated situation; that left 2 hours to finish up the characters and play.  Each of the characters ended up with a single scene, but I think everyone got a feel for how the resolution system works and got a decent taste of the game as a whole.  Couldn't really ask for much more.  <br/><br/>4E Dungeon Construction Kit: This was a lot of fun, the players were really into the game and were all excited to be playing some newfangled D&amp;D.  I've never run before with materials that looked so much like a real product: I got stuff from the printer just two days before the con.  I really like my heavy oversized dungeon tiles printed just for demos -- each square is 1.33" rather than the standard 1".  I was supposed to have a limited number of ashcans for sale at the con, but the regular-sized tiles didn't make it in.  They should be done in 2-3 weeks, and ashcans will be available then.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277408">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brendan" title="Brendan"><img alt="Brendan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.xorph.com/images/miniludie.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brendan">Brendan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277408/#Comment_277408" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T18:54:16+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  6:54PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: misuba</cite>Geiger Counter was a good time once my brain got into gear.</blockquote>\nAugh, I misremembered you as Joe, didn't I?

Amusingly enough, Twyla gave me shit for not raping the governor's daughter (before I married her to the captain), but my main goal was to have my guy make a deal with the devil. Which he did. Then he came to his senses and regretted it. It made me smile.<br/><br/>Saturday morning, I played Fiasco with James Brown and Adam. Hilarious hijinks in gangster London. I got to use my accents!<br/><br/>Afterwards, Matthew SB asked me to play Serial Homicide Unit. This is a cool game, I like it. Instead of an accent, they made my character a stutterer! And then Kiera played Wilson's character's wife ragging on him for a scene, and I had to pick my jaw up off the floor.<br/><br/>Then I showed up late to the lottery, I think because of lunch at the Honey Hole (which has amazing sandwiches), and Jackson shanghaied me into Apocalypse D&amp;D. Hands down the most laugh-inducing game of the con. I cast sleep on myself in the middle of a fight, and when I tried to Spout Lore about a purple worm, I spouted vomit instead. "That's my Exorcist impression. I call it my Prismatic Spray!"<br/><br/>Then I had Sage GMing again, with his cowboy Lady Blackbird hack. I got to do a bad-ass Southern accent this time, and shoot one of the other PCs.<br/><br/>Sunday morning I played Mars Colony with a fellow Vancouverite I didn't know (Kynnin, you can whisper me your email if you're reading this), which meant we could use certain political terms without having to explain them. We used Ping's loaded dice, so our story turned out to be ridiculously optimistic. Aside from being an interesting two-player game, I think Mars Colony might be better than Shock: for times when Joe or Daniel want to play a game as an excuse to do world-building.<br/><br/>Then Kingston shanghaied me into his Series of Unfortunate Events thing, and I got to do another British accent and get into mischief. He's got a good idea here, I hope he does something with it.<br/><br/>Remember Tomorrow was the only game I signed up for more than ten minutes in advance, and the only game I played all weekend that I'd played before. With Adam facilitating and not playing a character, we managed to get over the learning curve and just have fun this time.<br/><br/>That was my weekend. Totally exhausting, but somehow not long enough. Thank you everybody I played with, I had a lot of fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/shannon" title="shannon"><img alt="shannon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/shannon">shannon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277414/#Comment_277414" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-22T20:49:01+00:00" title="June 22, 2010  8:49PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Food, gaming, madness! I was a bit on the sick side, so I wussed out a bit and wasn't playing in every session but enjoyed what I played in!<br/><br/>Mist-Robed Gate in the fall of Atlantis: Stabbing things = awesome.<br/><br/>Wildlings: Good times, even if I was apparently rendered incapable of rolling any successes any time it mattered. We'll just say it's a good thing the tribe elders weren't watching our progress with a pair of binoculars.<br/><br/>Fiasco: Good &amp; creepy. It's the game Johnzo mentioned above (western setting), it definitely had it's weaknesses, but there were a lot of good moments too. The little red riding hood imagery at the end was nice.<br/><br/>Blockbuster Adventures: So much awesome, after all the baking and disease and rain it was just the hilarity I needed. Jungle Love is truly a film for the ages, and next year we definitely need to throw down with the Revenge of Oom Boom.<br/><br/>And of course, the best part was meeting a bunch of lovely new people, and seeing people I hadn't seen in a while, including locals I've been too lame to hang out with. There were a number of people I would have liked the opportunity to play with, maybe next year (or sooner, where applicable!).

Dev, I think the thing we didn't get about that one is that the point of that setup is so that the memory will have some emotional resonance for the person whose memory it is, but that's about as far as it goes.  Towards the end of the game, instead of playing the memories fairly straight, we started embellishing them with meth labs and dead bodies, and while I think that might have been a little bit gonzo for what the game designer may have intended, it kicked up both the story factor and the engagement factor for me.<br/><br/>And I have a different issue for the "Stoke v Birmingham 0-0" scenario, in that I personally am not a soccer fan.  I suspect that if the scenario were "Red Sox at Orioles, 1-0 in the 19th" I could have engaged with it a lot more directly - as it was, I was trying to use my own great affection for baseball to get into the character's head, and kept on running up against the fact that baseball games simply cannot end in a tie.  But I can also see that ending in a tie really connects to the theme of the scenario.<br/><br/>But (as you can see) I've done a lot of thinking about why the games didn't work for me, which is interesting and satisfying if not actually *fun*.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277470">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur" title="cwilbur"><img alt="cwilbur" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cwilbur">cwilbur</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277470/#Comment_277470" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T08:30:57+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  8:30AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite></blockquote>\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DevP</cite>"We built all these games that fit into our lives better so we can play them more; why do we still work ourselves so hard at cons?"

By contrast, the meth labs and murders were less engaging for me.<br/><br/>That said, I was intrigued enough by the experience to order the Norwegian Styles book on Monday.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277585">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joli" title="Joli"><img alt="Joli" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/955/n326E5QF6NNQ7.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joli">Joli</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277585/#Comment_277585" name="Item_58" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T15:39:26+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  3:39PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I wrote a bit about the game of the Drifter's Escape that I played, <a href="http://www.goplaynw.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=137" rel="nofollow">on the GPNW forums</a>.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277590">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277590/#Comment_277590" name="Item_59" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-23T16:16:10+00:00" title="June 23, 2010  4:16PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The title of this thread makes me feel uncomfortable.

Sorry they weren't necessarily everyone's cup of tea, but I'm glad you guys at least seemed to get something out of it.  I should say that I do have a propensity to select the weirdest games possible, so I'd encourage you to maybe give some of the other games from the collection a shot if you get the chance.  I think that Stoke-Birmingham 0-0, for me, was the more satisfying of the two.  I don't know whether you'd call it 'fun' in the traditional sense, but it was an interesting social experiment.  I'd definitely do it again.  The second game, which was called Forgotten Memories, didn't go quite as smoothly.  I think that might have partially been because I didn't explain the game well enough (I think doing it right after Stoke, where we were trying to be as bland as possible might have had an effect too...) and maybe partially because it was somewhat difficult to tell from the text how things should be going.  My impression is that it is supposed to be very driven by the Prompter and that the Storyteller shouldn't do too much but talk and wait for the Prompter to tell him/her what to do, which wasn't quite happening so much at the table, so I think I need to maybe emphasize that more in my preamble.  That being said, although if I had to do it over again, I probably would've run Until We Sink as the second game, it did give me something to think about and I would like to get the chance to play it again and apply what I've learned from this game.  Thanks to everyone who gave it a try!  I enjoyed playing with you.<br/><br/>Michael                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277743/#Comment_277743" name="Item_65" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T16:42:01+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  4:42PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I ran two games of Apocalypse World and succumbed to my raging head cold.
