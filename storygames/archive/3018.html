This has sort of been on the backburner until...<br/><br/>Ewen's comments in the Top 5 Most Wanted Settings Thread:\n<blockquote>5) Something -- I don't know what -- that creatively deconstructs Dungeons &amp; Dragons, its cliches, and the kinds of people who have played it over the years. </blockquote>\nAnd some of the discussion going on in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=2981&amp;page=1#Item_30" rel="nofollow">Fantasy Modern, not Modern Fantasy</a> thread.<br/><br/>...made me start thinking about it again. So, my question to you guys is this: if all of the  stereotypes and assumptions of D&amp;D (or any of its fantasy brethren) were completely 100% accurate... what sort of world would develop around this? Moreover, as I am looking for zany (although serious is good too), feel free to take a fully 'modern' view on how you (or the society) would take advantage of these eccentricities.<br/><br/>Here are a couple to get you started:<br/><br/>Because of all the adventurers (and normal folk) who need to kill monsters in order to get better at blacksmithing and diplomacy... "Theme" Dungeons  have been set up around the land: "For a low price of admission, you are your friends can get a chance to smash monsters and dodge traps in order to reach the "big prize" on the lowest level. Sound dangerous? Don't worry... we have a highly trained staff of clerics and resurrectionists who can get you back on your feet in no time! (cost of Raise Dead spell not included in admission fee)".<br/><br/>With all of these rampaging adventures destroying pretty much anything that has a chance of giving them "expee" or "fat lutes"... who is there to look out for the little guy? Don't worry, the SPM (Society for the Preservation of Monsters) is here! The SPM is a group of highly motivated volunteers who monitor the local monster populations and make sure to call in the Rangers if it looks like there is evidence of over-hunting (or, god forbid, adventuring without a permit).<br/><br/>Scattered throughout all of the big cities are local branches of the "Feat Masters" accounting firms. They make sure to work (for a nominal fee) with all adventurers to make sure that their "Optimal Level 20s" are on track. Their highly trained operatives can provide a detailed breakdown of the best feats from the most obscure sourcebooks and offer a clear, easy to achieve, path to reaching the prestige class of your dreams. Like they say "When you hit 20... you don't want to be doing that much damage".                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68718/#Comment_68718" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T15:26:32+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  3:26PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Optimal Twenty feat development firm. wonderful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_68723">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Iskander" title="Iskander"><img alt="Iskander" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.ajnewman.net/i/eye.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Iskander">Iskander</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68723/#Comment_68723" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T16:41:02+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  4:41PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Can I be a terrorist member of DETM? <i>(Druids for the Ethical Treament of Monsters)</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_68734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Bryan" title="Bryan"><img alt="Bryan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Bryan">Bryan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/68734/#Comment_68734" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-05-12T18:56:24+00:00" title="May 12, 2007  6:56PM">May 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Lynch Lord without a Dungeon?
