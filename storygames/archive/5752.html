What's the process.<br/><br/>Functional text:<br/>1) Pick up text. Read it. Get excited.<br/>2) Find some friends. Get them excited.<br/>3) Play. Have fun.<br/>4) Play again.<br/><br/>Semi-functional text:<br/>1) Pick up text. Read it. Get excited but confused.<br/>2) Post to the forum of the designer. Have involved conversation about the game.<br/>3) Find some friends. Get them excited.<br/>4) Play. Be more confused.<br/>5) More internet conversations with the designer.<br/>6) Play again.<br/>7) More internet conversations with the designer.<br/>8) Play again. Have fun.<br/>9) Write on the internet about how now you get it and man is it awesome. Maybe phrase it in a stuck up "difficult to learn games" way that looks down your nose at the people playing the first game.<br/><br/>Note that the reward, in terms of exposure, goes to the semi-coherent text.<br/><br/>I've noticed this with Bliss Stage. Despite serious, serious editing errors (like a discrepancy about Bliss from broken relationships, and a missing rule about starting age), the game text teaches you in exhaustive and slow detail about how to play the game. Thus: zero posting about it.<br/><br/>Fortunately for me, my target audience isn't y'all, so this isn't a big deal. But if you're designing not for profit, but for social cred on Story Games? Oh, man, a semi-coherent text is the way to go. And I'd give that advice to anyone.</blockquote>\nI think Ben is spot-on here.  I think this community or communities ends up rewarding games that are semi-functional more than games that are fully-functional.  And wording is important, here: this community <em>ends up</em> doing that rewarding, not with it being anybody's intention to do so.  Just like how nobody really wants to shoot the Steward, but they almost always do.<br/><br/>So the question is: how do we fix this reward cycle?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128659/#Comment_128659" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:19:52+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:19PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So I think good critical reviews will help. We've been over that before. <br/><br/>I also think that people who really talk passionately and positively about games they really enjoy is also good. Like, many of Judd's AP posts serve as an example here. Judd doesn't say a game is brilliant, (or doesn't just say is) -- he talks about what the game did in play, why he likes that, what it did, and often times what else he would like to do or do better. <br/><br/>We don't have to chop games to reduce the cycle (in fact, that may be counter productive, for the reasons of Drama I shall speak of below). What we may want to do is be positive about games that we've actually had good experiences with and speak of them grounded in those experiences. Not to, say, assume that PTA is the game for everyone (it isn't), but to talk about what our PTA game was like and why we think that was, so that others can take out of that what they want to. <br/><br/>At that point, one would hope, it may become possible to tell the games people are talking about because they really love them vs the games people are talking about because they are the RPG.net/Storygames darling of the month. <br/><br/>I think that cutting the Drama is also useful. <br/><br/>Because man, the thing that gets the most social reward on the interent is having some drama. Love a game, hate a game, tell everyone else how they should or should not play and BOOM. Drama. <br/><br/>Tell everyone their favorite game is crap. Drama!<br/><br/>Tell everyone the game they didn't like is brilliant and they just don't get it. Drama! <br/><br/>Pose problems, even problems that are real but are subtle and multidimensional, as though they're simple and have clear answers that involve everyone else changing. Drama!<br/><br/>And oh my god, will you ever get so much attention for that drama.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128660">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128660/#Comment_128660" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:22:26+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:22PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I talk about games I play and enjoy (Ben's initial case).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128665">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley" title="Jack Aidley"><img alt="Jack Aidley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jack%20Aidley">Jack Aidley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128665/#Comment_128665" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:26:09+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:26PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'm really not sure I agree.

But the thing is, nothing ever quite gets done about it.  It's a rare game that is not slow-cooked to perfection.  The technology is now here to make printing a book almost an afterthought.  That doesn't mean it should be an afterthought.  It's like how cheap public transportation makes it easy to get to the other side of town -- you should still have a reason for going to the other side of town before you get on the bus.<br/><br/>From my angle right now, I think the problem is exposure.  We have crappy tools for gaining exposure when a game is in development (forum posts, playtests, sneak peeks at art), and we have quick and easy tools for gaining exposure when a game is in print (POD publishing, the Forge booth, GenCon).  We aren't even capable of taking away the quick and easy tools, so the question becomes how do we make getting exposure in development easier?<br/><br/>Here's one idea: some central repository for games-in-development.  In my head, I'm thinking of a website where designers can upload their games for public review.  Maybe have some ability to have discussion there, but that's not really the point.  I'm not saying there should be a new destination site; I'm saying there should be a service that makes it quick and easy to make games-in-development available.  At the outset, a simple FTP server is a first step, so that any thread anywhere (here, on Knife Fight, at RPG.net, in blogs, in emails) can link to the rules document.  But we could go a step beyond that: it should be trivial (I say ignorantly) to set up an automatic process for any PDF that is uploaded to be split up into its individual pages, too (or make it a pull-based server-side whatsit, technical people weigh in!).  Then we can not just link to the rules document, but we can link to the specific page of the rules document we're talking about.<br/><br/>What I'd like to stay away from, though, is saying things like "We really need to all just pay more attention to games in development" sort of pie-in-the-sky stuff.  It's not going to happen; these things have been said before.  The fact of the matter is, paying attention to games in development is difficult, unrewarding, and often frustrating.  If we want to change how much attention goes that way, we need to make it easy, rewarding, and fun to do so.  To take the central repository as an example, it doesn't directly make people pay more attention -- but it makes it lots easier for people to do so.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128678">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins" title="Brand_Robins"><img alt="Brand_Robins" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/406/nCDIUR7B6HAEI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brand_Robins">Brand_Robins</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128678/#Comment_128678" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:36:20+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:36PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Josh, <br/><br/>I think your central repository idea is great. <br/><br/>I just think I don't want "a central repository" I want "multiple central repositories" -- with each of those being more focused on specific groups with specific ideas and goals. <br/><br/>If we make the process smaller, more local, and more personal again then maybe we can get back some of the aspects of the small, local, and personal design school elements that made, say, the Forge, rock so hard back in the pre-diaspora days. <br/><br/><br/>(Note, "local" can be "virtual local" too.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128686">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128686/#Comment_128686" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:41:34+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brand, let me clear up: ideally, the "central repository" is that and only that: all it does is store and serve files.  Ideally, it does not have a forum for discussing those files.  It is not another storygames/knifefight/RPGnet/whatever.  It's a service that can be used everywhere, not a new place to discuss things.  It's like <a href="http://tinyurl.com" rel="nofollow">tinyurl</a>: just a nifty thing that makes discussing things <em>everywhere on the Internet</em> easier.  Then, there can be any number of specific groups doing their specific things in their specific ways -- using a straightforward document server to help.<br/><br/>While I'd like to discuss some "new ways to develop and publish games" I think that a lot of it will become fluff -- I think that tools that can be used have a far better chance of actually inciting change.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128687">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128687/#Comment_128687" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T12:41:55+00:00" title="February 21, 2008 12:41PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited February 21, 2008 12:42PM by Jason_Morningstar.">edited February 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You know, I'm mentoring several games right now, if that's the right word.

I don't think that the first case games produce excitement so much as they produce contentment: ah, that was a good meal.  My tummy is full.  Moving along.<br/><br/>The second case is more likely to provoke a stronger reaction, and stronger reactions are more likely to put the game outside of the zone of mediocrity.  Outside the zone of mediocrity, more conversation is due to happen.<br/><br/>Here's another observation:<br/><br/>I think the first case falls into the zone also because a well-designed game often does not promote a sense of ownership.  A broken game -- the second case -- actually gives me a greater opportunity to feel like I can take ownership of it because there are problems to fix; I become more of an owner of the property by examining what's broken and suggesting potential fixes.<br/><br/>Thus I conclude that if the first case wants to co-opt the out-of-zone mindshare that the second case gets, the first case needs to be better at promoting a sense of ownership.   Give people fiddly bits to configure those games with.  Don't give one good solution to the problems your well-designed game fixes; give three good solutions, and thereby build in a need for folks to discuss which solution they think works best for them, and why.<br/><br/>Embed reasons for talking about the game, in the game.  Which is not as simple as just building the best game you possibly can.  Plenty of excellent stuff isn't worth talking about at all (and often it doesn't sell as well as it could, as a result).<br/><br/>Ben's second case is currently winning the "something to talk about" game because something broken or incomplete is a very cheap, easy way to create something worth talking about.  It's not a great, nor even necessarily a good, way to do it -- but it's easy, and you can (and often do) stumble into doing it without <i>intending</i> to.<br/><br/>The first case stuff can only overcome this by being more worthy of conversation for <i>good</i> reasons.  And that's harder work than producing something broken.  That's just flat out not going to change, so I tend to view this as a burden on the producers of the first-case stuff.  <br/><br/>Producing something excellent is not enough.  Producing something <i>remarkable</i> -- that is, something that's worth making a remark upon -- is what you're truly going for here.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Prize-Inside-Next-Marketing/dp/B0007XWMZG/iagonet" rel="nofollow">Seth Godin has written an entire book about this.</a>  I recommend everyone who's looking to get a game out there and noticed give it a read (I believe it's a follow-up to his Purple Cow book, but I haven't read that one yet, just this one.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128718">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128718/#Comment_128718" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T13:10:50+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  1:10PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: iago</cite>Embed reasons for talking about the game, in the game.

Right now, there is little in the way of genuine alternatives to print publication.  Walton and Shreyas are the flagbearers, here.  What do we do with games that are fun and complete, but not going into print?  How do we get them more attention, how do we get them more play (and thus more attention), and how do we incorporate them into the creative collaboration stew from which the next generation of games is derived?<br/><br/>What makes people not play these games?  What are the barriers?  Are they hard to print?  Is referencing a pile of loose sheets annoying to manage at the table?  Do non-printed books not have the same community of support that printed books have (or seem to have)?<br/><br/>I could write up a short thing that explains how easy it is to turn a pdf file into a comb-bound booklet; would that help get more people to give this a try?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128755">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128755/#Comment_128755" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T13:51:04+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  1:51PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite>What do we do with games that are fun and complete, but not going into print?

Fate's community was born out of the Fudge community, and Fudge has <i>always</i> had an ethic -- a mandate, even -- that its players customize the system to fit the needs for the game they're playing.  So when Fate spun off from Fudge (inasmuch as it "spun off" at all), it took that ethic of -- wait for it -- player ownership of the game right along with it.  What Fate did in the form we originally released, though, was what Fudge was missing: we didn't just say "here's a toolkit, build a game", we said "here's a bunch of pre-fabricated options that you can plug together to build yourself a Fate implementation of your own, rapidly".  We didn't say "here's the one way to build this out", though, and I think that's important too.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Josh Bonobo Roby</cite>What do we do with games that are fun and complete, but not going into print?</blockquote>\nThat is really fucking hard, man.  The big issue I see there is that <b>print</b> gives you a physical artifact, which connects through the primitive-brain's idea that what you can touch and physically handle and see is real and important, and <b>purchase</b> increases your emotional, gut sense of valuation for the game.<br/><br/>So the challenge for free or at least not-in-print games is to figure out how to communicate on a gut, visceral, emotional level with the stuff that ISN'T an intellectual response to the game.<br/><br/>Possibilities include:<br/><br/>- Take advantage of the idea that we were an oral culture long before we were a print one, and make sure to give people ways to connect to the game that doesn't put it in competition with the mindshare of a print game: e.g., record and circulate short audio recordings that teach the game; work on getting some podcasters excited about those games (podcasters are alpha gamers, so this pays off in many ways)<br/><br/>- Create tools and experiences for the game that transcend what print is even capable of: web-widgets and whatnot (see: abulafia) to enhance the experience of interacting with the non-print game.<br/><br/>- Other stuff I'm not thinking of.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_128763">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128763/#Comment_128763" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-21T14:02:13+00:00" title="February 21, 2008  2:02PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My plan is to make free games that are so mind-numbingly awesome that people will not be able to keep themselves from playing them.

Right now, there is little in the way of genuine alternatives to print publication.  Walton and Shreyas are the flagbearers, here.  What do we do with games that are fun and complete, but not going into print?  How do we get them more attention, how do we get them more play (and thus more attention), and how do we incorporate them into the creative collaboration stew from which the next generation of games is derived? </blockquote>\nTalking about myself (I can't presume what could get OTHERS to play free games), these games should be:<br/>1) in a printable format (a good-looking pdf that would not bleed my ink cartridges dry) to read and look at<br/>2) look like a full game (with example, explanations, presentation, etc), not like a conflict resolution system.<br/>3) something that I would want to play if I saw it on a game shop shelf.<br/>4) not something to playtest to find out if it works<br/><br/>I PREFERS to buy pdfs, so it's not the format the barrier: it's the way these games often look perennially half-finished, or they lack text that explain how to play, etc.<br/><br/>Some real-life examples:<br/><br/>- The Pool: I always wanted to try running this game, but I get the impression that to be able to run it well I would have to read years of forge threads with explanations and advices. (I played it at a convention as a player, though)<br/>- Bacchanal: it's a good-looking pdf: check. it look (and it's considered) like a complete game, not a work in progress: check. So I downloaded it. When I did read a thread of advices on running it at the Forge, we played it.<br/>- Doubt (a jeepform, it's downloadable from the jeepform site): this is the perfect example of a pdf game that make you want to play it. The layout is better than the one of many published games and it's full of advices. It's a game, not a resolution system. <br/><br/>I see another problem for these games in getting "talked" here, though: when I play a free game and I don't like it, I don't bug the designer. I didn't pay money, so I feel like the designer owed me nothing. (and, at the same time, I play brought games with more assurance that if something goes wrong I can bug the designer until he answer my questions)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_128950">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hituro" title="Hituro"><img alt="Hituro" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.solipsist-rpg.com/uploads/attachments/32/snail_icon_32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hituro">Hituro</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/128950/#Comment_128950" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T02:22:39+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  2:22AM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ben Lehman</cite>I don't think criticism stops this cycle: the reward is attention, not praise.

It required cuts, as the pages were 6x9, and I had it done same-day, because it was a bit of a sudden thing.  So it can be a bit cheaper than what I got, if you plan ahead to do this -- but Lulu ain't cheap, either, once you start talking larger numbers.  If I'm sending a physical copy to everybody I want to read/play it, that's ten copies at the low end (assume 1 out of 5 copies generate feedback, which is generous), and these are development costs, not generating revenue in return.  I think at that point, what you've got is an ashcan, and you might as well treat it as Matt and Paul do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_129418">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby" title="Josh Roby"><img alt="Josh Roby" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://kallistipress.com/images/goplayhighway-sm.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Josh%20Roby">Josh Roby</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/129418/#Comment_129418" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-02-22T16:04:04+00:00" title="February 22, 2008  4:04PM">February 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prod.<br/><br/>It looks like there is a lot of bandwidth going to recognizing faults that have gone unrecognized, or spoken about quietly, which is <em>great</em>.  I'd still like to look for means to change how the system works so these things don't get ignored, or ideally, these faults get baked into new games less frequently.<br/><br/>So far, we have:<br/>1) a web service to host playtest documents to make them easy to reference and easy to disseminate.<br/>2) ground reviews in actual play<br/>3) "Only one thread about a given game on the frontpage at any given time."<br/>4) Guidelines for turning a PDF into a usable booklet<br/>5) Give your games means to provoke a sense of ownership in its players/playtesters<br/>6) Borrow solutions from online gaming on fora and chatrooms and whatnot<br/>7) Make sure your PDF-only game still looks good, not like an RTF document.<br/>8) Consider sending out physical copies for playtests to encourage sense of ownership.<br/><br/>I'm sure there's more...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
