But I found often I'd forget one of the layers when I was doing it in my head (i.e. I'd forget about the table while focusing on the in-game fiction).  <br/><br/>What techniques did you use to keep your mock troupe straight?  <br/><br/>I'm assuming you did this in writing - how would you compare this to other kinds of writing?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305575">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Gee" title="Joe Gee"><img alt="Joe Gee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Gee">Joe Gee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305575/#Comment_305575" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T10:33:52+00:00" title="December 22, 2010 10:33AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The first thing I did was get together a good group.  I had been reading the webcomic Darths &amp; Droids, and basically stole that group dynamic.  I had 5 players, which I named Action Man, Drama Queen, Fanboy (he\u2019s the Munchkin jerk), Hitchhiker (the group\u2019s funny man, the name came from Douglas Adams), and the Professor.   You can probably guess the personalities. If they aren\u2019t clear, let me know.  I remember the team with the mnemonic of \u201cPhD in Fine Arts\u201d.<br/><br/>So at the beginning of every game I draw a pentagram and randomly assign players to each of the five points.  Then I roll a d6 for each connection.  On a 1-2, that means that means there are negative feelings towards the other player, 3-4 is neutral, and 5-6 is positive.  This gives me a relationship map to me role-play the group.  Here\u2019s an example.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="denied:\u201dhttp://fc05.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2010/356/2/7/relationship_map_by_achillesdesire-d35f5cv.jpg\u201d"/><br/><br/>In this game, Action Man is angry with Hitch so he\u2019ll generally play against him.  However, Hitch is trying to make up for it, so he\u2019ll add elements that he thinks that AM will like.  Fanboy is supportive to Hitch, but the Drama Queen is angry at the Professor.     <br/><br/>With all this in mind, I start the tenet phase.  The good thing is that you don\u2019t have to spend any coins on social contracts.  Here\u2019s a quick example:<br/><br/>-I always start at the bottom of the pentagram and work clockwise-<br/><br/><img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/>  Let\u2019s do something based on Shakespeare, like <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Romeo and Juliet</span>. (D1/24)  -The shorthand here is number of coins spent / number of coins left.<br/>F:  Okay, but it\u2019s Shakespeare meets <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lovecraft</span>. (F1/24)<br/>A:  I want <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Romeo</span> to be a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Demon Hunter</span>. (A2/23)<br/>P: Romeo hunts those demons in weird <span style="text-decoration: underline;">limbo dimensions</span> with <span style="text-decoration: underline;">non-Euclidean geometry</span>. (P2/23)<br/>H:  The hunter is known as the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Accordion Man</span> since he <span style="text-decoration: underline;">can fold space</span>. (H2/23)<br/><br/>I don\u2019t think A will like this, so H spends another to add that the Hunter <span style="text-decoration: underline;">beats the crap out of anyone that calls him that</span>.  So (H1/22).  When writing the logs, I usually underline any elements that are bought with coins.  Scene changes are makes the same way as many short stories with triple asterisks, like so * * *<br/><br/>That\u2019s pretty much how play continues.  I generally have two pages in front of me. One is the gameplay logs, and the second for notes such as the pentagram with bank balances and element summaries.  All gameplay is done with a pencil because there\u2019s a ton of erasing.<br/><br/>As a side-note, for a randomizer I use a deck of cards without face cards, instead of dice because it\u2019s easier to manage.  The card variant is on the Ramshead site.<br/><br/>Now, compared to other writing, I do get a different result than if I were writing without any rules, and strangely those stories created in a game framework seem more compelling because it forces me to consider outcomes that I would not have thought of otherwise.  And there have been times that I have gone back and edited the troupe\u2019s play into a short story.<br/><br/>I believe that limitations help create good art, and by using games an artist can surprise themselves.  I can\u2019t say how many times I\u2019ve gotten over a case of writer\u2019s block by playing this game.  If I don\u2019t know what to write, one of the other five will.  I know it sounds completely schizophrenic, but it works.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_305577">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Gee" title="Joe Gee"><img alt="Joe Gee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Joe%20Gee">Joe Gee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305577/#Comment_305577" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-22T10:36:05+00:00" title="December 22, 2010 10:36AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oops.

However, when playing the troupe I noticed after a few solo games that I was being too agreeable with myself when it came to creating conflicts.  I also noticed that the behavior of the players was sometimes too predictable since I created them with broad strokes.<br/><br/>When the players were neutral this was what was happening:<br/><br/>A:  Let\u2019s do a World War II story.<br/>P: Okay, I\u2019ll add an element that involves mysteries, hard science, or some high-brow question about humanity.  Think Star Trek or Asimov.<br/>H: Okay, I\u2019ll add an element that is a comedy relief, chaotic, or the opposite of what everyone else is doing.  Think Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy or Discworld.<br/><img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> Okay, I\u2019ll add an element involving ethos, soap opera dramatics, or romanticism.  Think Nicholas Sparks or Tennessee Williams.<br/>F: Okay, I\u2019ll add an element that involves ninjas, zombies, dinosaurs, or some such.  Think b-movies and anime.<br/><br/>Now let\u2019s repeat that, but now the Professor and Fanboy are both negative towards Action Man, and Hitch is positive towards the Professor.<br/><br/>A:  Let\u2019s do a World War II story.<br/>P: I don\u2019t want that, so I\u2019m going to create an element that that involves mysteries, hard science, or some high-brow question about humanity BUT downplays the World War II element.  For example, it\u2019s like World War II but gunpowder doesn\u2019t work.  This is keeping the WWII element, but using it in a way that was not intended by Action Man.<br/>H: Okay, I\u2019m going to add to the Professor\u2019s direction.  It\u2019ll still be comedy relief, chaotic, or the opposite of what everyone else is doing.  Example: Instead of guns, the weapon of choice is water balloons filled with various acids, sleeping gas and such.<br/><img alt="D:" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/anguished.png" title="D:"/> Okay, I\u2019ll add an element involving ethos, soap opera dramatics, or romanticism. \u2013Unchanged behavior-<br/>F: Okay, I\u2019ll add an element that involves ninjas, zombies, dinosaurs, or some such and further downplays the WWII aspect.  Example: One of the water balloon chemicals causes people to mutate into monsters.<br/><br/>In this example, Action Man doesn\u2019t like the direction that this story is going in, but he also knows that he Challenges, he\u2019s probably going to be outspent.  So in this game he\u2019s not going to introduce many elements since he knows that they won\u2019t be used properly anyways. Those elements that he does create will be strongly supported with a ton of points. Instead, he\u2019s going to be creating Complications to get more Coins.  Then he can outbid the other players and guide the story back into the original war movie direction.<br/><br/>I consider the storytellers to like elemental forces in the story universe and the story comes from those gods creating champions, forming rivalries, and alliances to further their idea of what the universe should be. <br/><br/>So here\u2019s a thought experiment.  Given the WWII game, Action Man starts narrating an event \u201cThe ace pilot was flying his plane towards the enemy base *sigh* with a giant water balloon when . . .\u201d<br/><br/>Now, consider how each of the other players would try to complicate this.<br/><br/>If the Professor was a rival then . . .<br/>If the Drama Queen was a rival then . . .<br/>If the Hitchhiker was a rival then . . .<br/>If the Fanboy was a rival then . . .                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_305728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman" title="David Artman"><img alt="David Artman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/064/n8U0POSRVSCL3.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Artman">David Artman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/305728/#Comment_305728" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-23T11:07:48+00:00" title="December 23, 2010 11:07AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *blink*<br/><br/>*blink*<br/><br/>Damn, Joe... that just might be the best idea for solo RPG/narrative gaming I've ever heard.

I like the term "mock troupe".<br/><br/>The game is following the four crew members of the Free Trader 'Rocinante' as they span the galaxy. Their personalities really come out during the individual crew "logs" I write out. And those personality traits end up being reused and honed during scenes with the other crewmembers and other people. I'm getting to learn how each character would respond in a given situation, like watching a favorite TV show. The FATE Aspects and Stunts help with that.<br/><br/>I use some random SF content generation tables and the Gamemaster 'Plot Twist Cards' to throw some monkey wrenches in the mix. I also like downloading cool SF art from the net for inspiration.<br/><br/>But really, when I do the scenes, the interesting characters, color and situations typically jump out at me. It's much more of a relaxed pace than tabletop play, but then again I'm moving at no one's pace but my own.<br/><br/>And for the record, it <i>feels</i> a lot like roleplaying to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
