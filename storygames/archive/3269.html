Thus I make a small attempt<br/>to flesh out a resource system for tsoy in those cases where you want to play a rich merchant or fireflyesque mercenary<br/>trying to make ends meet.<br/><b><br/><span style="font-family: Helvetica;">Version 1) The pool.</span></b><br/><br/>Difficulty here is that everything in tsoy tends just to go up, instead of fluctuate. Only things that go up and down are pools<br/>and harm. So let's start with introducing a <b>Resources-pool</b>. Which acts as a counter how much liquid power and money you have. It does not represent just money. This pool cannot be refreshed, but you can spend it on as many bonus dice as you wish for rolls where money will help. GM is encouraged to make rolls which eat resources bit more difficult than usual, and stricly consider disallowing other helping skills.<br/><br/>Who has the pool? If you have common resources like in firefly have a common pool. Otherwise, to each his own.<br/><br/>How do you get it back? (This is the big flaw in my plan <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>. By rolling craft skills? As stakes for a conflict (like robbery, how much?). Refresh scenes that you can have only at specified times? Dealing with npcs 'ingame'?<br/><br/><b> Secret of Liquidity</b><br/>(Perhaps it could work like rest of the pools and just give you one die.) You can take more than one bonus dice from your resource pool at a time.<br/><br/><b> Secret of Great Wealth</b><br/>You come from among the rich and the wealthy. You can spend a refresh scene to refresh the resources pool.<br/><br/><b>Secret of Money Talks</b><br/>You know money. You know the handshake. You know the show. you can add dice from your resource pool to social contests<br/><br/><b>Secret of Military Savvy</b><br/>You know how to best use your resources when tending to your military unit. You can grant single bonus die to military tests from<br/>resources pool. (previously purchased mailshirts.. high quality bows..)<br/><br/>Also, if you are willing to consider my idea of harm cards in another thread, you could do stuff like:<br/><br/><b>Harm of a Debt</b><br/>You have a cash-flow difficulties..<br/>1 Penalty die for resource requiring tasks<br/>1 XP for invoking<br/>Buyoff: 2 resources OR scene with a collector<br/><b>Harm of a boon</b><br/>You're broke, and someone has you on the line. If it is not cash it is some favour you need to pull.<br/>1 Penalty die for resource requiring tasks<br/>1 XP for invoking<br/>Buyoff: 5 resources OR given boon OR scene with someone willing to break kneecaps.<br/><br/><br/><b>Firefly-specific:</b><br/><b>Harm of Broken Engines</b><br/>Guess you really should have listened to Keylee about the getting the new ring-collector in time.. Shit!<br/>1 Penalty die for resource with travel via Serenity.<br/>1 XP for invoking<br/>Buyoff: 5 resources <br/><br/>(I would vision that it is a difficult pilot roll to get starship to another planet. But you can spend resources on it - as fuel)<br/><br/>And of course, you can do bit glorantha-like stuff. When tending to your lands in fantasy game, make up the fief as an npc with skills such as Harshness or Taxation and roll against those every year..<br/><br/>And of course, you want to acquire stuff that has mechanical impact as well. I was thinking about BE style tech burner with guidelines for pricing stuff.. but I truly doubt I can muster the effort for doing that in way that is actually workable, atleast without nailing down the setting. So I would let the mechanical effect for a price be decided by the the rest of the group in manner suitable to their vision of the world. (Say, everyone votes and if it is not unanimous you pick the median vote and record the price for further purchases). Also, XP costs Need To Be paid per item as in tsoy rules..<br/><br/><b>Secret of Financial Power</b><br/>Test your financial skill to increase or decrease a recorded price of an item by one<br/>Cost: 3 Reason.<br/><b></b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74230">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey" title="Mark_Causey"><img alt="Mark_Causey" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/446/nWNKRJQFWMH71.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mark_Causey">Mark_Causey</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74230/#Comment_74230" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T10:28:18+00:00" title="June  7, 2007 10:28AM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The way I'd handle this is to give everyone a Resource Pool (just like Vigor or Instinct).<br/><br/>You want something in the game and you want to do it via Resources? Make a roll as normal, but spend Resource Points instead of Instinct , Reason, or Vigor. If you're successful, then you had enough Resources. If you aren't, then you can Haggle and Bring Down the Pain. Then you can take Resource Harm (maybe to be tracked differently from the other Harm track?). If you take Resource Harm, then you'll spend points from your Pool to recover the Harm and then you'll need a Resource Refresh scene to recover.<br/><br/>Make sense?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy" title="Steve_Segedy"><img alt="Steve_Segedy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/571/nE7KKTXCN8QM8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Steve_Segedy">Steve_Segedy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74269/#Comment_74269" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T13:49:01+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  1:49PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've wrestled with the same concept for TSOY, and in particular for a Firefly-esque game we ran.  Although I considered the Pool option, I ended up trying to do it as an Ability.  In such a case, it would parallel skills like Scrounging or Theft- a successful skill roll (possibly against long odds) means that you've drawn on your resources (cash, a warehouse full of junk, friends in high places) to accomplish your objective.  <br/><br/>With such an ability, having a higher rating results in more resources- a Grand Master is perhaps a very wealthy man, or a politician with lots of friends.  However, as you pointed out, abilities never decrease, so representing a loss of wealth, etc. would be a challenge.  The other tricky part is deciding which pool this ability is associated with- Vigor, Instinct, or Reason?  You could make an argument for any of them, I think.<br/><br/>For the Pool idea, I like use of secrets to define how you can use it (i.e. which abilities it can support).  I'd say that refresh scenes are still the appropriate way to refill the pool, and those scenes could be rare and really interesting.  When you're on the run from the Alliance and you need to fix your ship in a hurry, you might have to make some desperate, shady deals to get off that rock and back into the Black...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_74273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler" title="tony_dowler"><img alt="tony_dowler" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://planet-thirteen.com/images/tent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/tony_dowler">tony_dowler</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74273/#Comment_74273" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T14:07:11+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  2:07PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is awesome! I think you totally hit on it. I've been working on a resources hack for my TSOY variant Mathematica, but I think I might like yours better.<br/><br/>And yes, I agree with Mark. Let them take a "resources" scene to recover.<br/><br/>Here's how I've been doing it in Mathematica:<br/>There are two secrets, wealth and rank (social rank being important in Mathematica).<br/>Your rank determines what kind of resources you normally have. You can have the secret multiple times. No rank means you've got the essentials of life, rank 1 means you have servants, 2 an estate, 3 multilpe homes and castes, 4 you're a king.<br/>The secret of wealth gives you access to wealth as though you were one rank higher.<br/><br/>I'm running a playtest tomorrow where money is important to the scenario. I think I'll try both these sytems and see which one works better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_74287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM" title="MikeRM"><img alt="MikeRM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.csidemedia.com/files/Mike-32x32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MikeRM">MikeRM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/74287/#Comment_74287" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-06-07T14:47:23+00:00" title="June  7, 2007  2:47PM">June 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's always puzzled me about the Solar System that there is a Key where you get XP for doubling your wealth, but there is <i>no measure of wealth in the system</i>.<br/><br/>This is good.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
