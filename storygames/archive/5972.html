But I'm doing it anyway. This is about Ryan Stoughton's unnameable game. It's also kind of a Red Box Hack thread, since Ryan's game borrows so heavily from Eric's game. If you're not interested, don't read any further. <br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Ryan,<br/><br/>I just read both drafts of your TGCHNN (yeah, I'm sneaky that way). Very neat stuff!<br/><br/>There are a couple of things in there that are simply beautiful:<br/><br/>1. The way attributes are randomly determined, but don't put you at a disadvantage if you roll poorly.<br/>2. You took Red Box Hack limitations and made them into TSoY Keys, dude! Awesome. That's just what they needed.<br/>3. The Strategist/Commander features are hothothot. Just sweet. It's the best version of organizing/planning/strategizing rules I've seen, and they make me want to actually play them.<br/><br/>Now, a few comments and questions:<br/><br/>1. There doesn't seem to be much of a way to get more Conviction in combat. In the second version, you can steal it, which is cool, but it still seems like it would drain away over the course of a fight. Do you foresee a problem there?<br/><br/>2. Why such a narrow spread for stats? (Granted, the 2d6 scale does suggest a practical limit of +5.)<br/><br/>3. You mentioned in the other thread that something about the rules sucks. What was it? Have you fixed it?<br/><br/>4. In the second draft, it looks like the loser of a roll decides what to do with successes. (What about failures?) How do you keep this from getting frustrating for the winner, if I've read you correctly? <br/><br/>I know this is unsolicited. But you posted the rules, so you'll just have to take it. You're onto something pretty cool, I think.<br/><br/>Cheers!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_133500">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133500/#Comment_133500" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T15:10:25+00:00" title="March  8, 2008  3:10PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            How on earth did you get the second draft?  There I'm just throwing around ideas, I don't think they'll all stick.  In fact I've been revising them all afternoon since then.<br/><br/><b>Good stuff response:</b><br/>1.  The math is beautiful but I'm not sure about the effect on play.  I found that even when I was managing just a few NPCs, having 8 Stats for everything was more cumbersome than I really wanted.  We had a Rank 0 character and a rank 2 character.  The rank 2 character's extra Features were a big factor.<br/>2.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Best rule of the night, and I need to do more of this.  I think if -essentially - awesome tokens stuck around and had noncombat applications and generation they'd be more fun.  Way more.  I really like the ability to use them (quasi-awesome tokens) outside of combat as well as in combat.  You'll also note that in the second draft the cost of using Conviction went down.<br/>3.  Yeah, those were used by a character in a previous incarnation of my game and they ARE sweet.  One thing that happened was that we had an insightful out of combat dude who was the face man for hte party, but another one who was the good tactical commander.  It was sweet.<br/><br/><b>Bad stuff response:</b><br/>1.  Yeah.  It was a problem and the second version isn't the solution.  We need more Keys, which are awesome.<br/><br/>2.  The spread seemed to work in previous incarnations of the game - although that one included ways to go down to -2.  I think a spread of 1-6 is about the max I could go.<br/><br/>3.  Oi... yeah, the rules kind of sucked.  Conviction was too expensive and it was too hard to get more.  There was also a sense of "whiff" "whiff" "whiff" roll-off to death.  That relates right back to not being able to do something cool to get Conviction, which was a mistake on my part.<br/><br/>4.  Forget that stuff.  I want to do something player-narrated with 6es and 1s but not that.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133519">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133519/#Comment_133519" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-08T18:07:24+00:00" title="March  8, 2008  6:07PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ah, I see!<br/><br/>Good stuff. <br/><br/>The spread thing is just a question of whether it allows for enough difference between PCs. I mean, if you've got the Giant with a Might 3, who's described as 8 feet tall and twice as broad, and then a faerie or whatever who's tiny, and that's Might 0, well, the faerie can still push around the Giant, like 15-25% of the time (depending on whether it's an opposed roll or unopposed). That might be a problem, and it might not.<br/><br/>How are the armour rules? Do they work as intended? A +1 to defend, all the time ,(If they don't, have you considered something like: "This armour subtracts one point of damage any time a defense roll comes up with all even results"?)<br/><br/>As for whiff, I've never liked the "roll to hit" model. It's sort of guaranteed to give a "nothing happens" result half the time (which is what is "expected" if you're making opposed rolls). Maybe a different model would be better? One where "you hit" is not what is at stake? A simple alternative is an opposed roll where the winner gets to hit the loser ,for instance.<br/><br/>Anyway, looking forward to more!

It says gain five towards maximum. Is that maximum your starting level? Or the ten? <br/>\n<br/>\nCan I rest more than once in a row?

It should require a scene in which the character actually encounters somebody or something that gives him that conviction. Re-reading LotR, I'm finding again how interesting it is that Frodo almost runs out of gas repeatedly, only to end up in some elven haven where he regains his conviction. That occurs because of the special nature of the place, and the encounters he has there. <br/>\n<br/>\nI think it would rock if you could incorporate that into the game. If the character has conviction... what are his convictions? Perhaps a character should have a list of, say, three convictions, and can only use conviction to further acts that go along the lines of these convictions? Said convictions subject to change at each conviction regeneration scene? <br/>\n<br/>\nThis would rock probably even more than The Riddle of Steel's "Spiritual Attributes."

I'm only seeing the text you link above. Is there another with "keys" in it? Or that's where you're headed? Or are we supposed to assume things from Red Box Hack (of which I'm woefully unfamiliar) here? <br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, again, how often can you regen? Can you have two resting scenes in a row? If the limit were only after you spend at least one conviction, then the total can go up over time. But I'm thinking that it's pretty cheesy to allow two in a row... what's the point of setting a limit then? You might as well always allow it to go up to ten. Who decides if a scene counts? <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I'm thinking that the amount of conviction you get back ought to have something to do with the magnitude of the situation the character encounters, and how it impacts him. Not sure how to guage that properly. I'd probably create a counter-mechanic where the player can take as much Conviction as he likes from a situation... deciding for himself just how deeply his character is impacted... but then have to take some downside (like committing to something that, if lost, will cost lots of Conviction, or... something). <br/>\n<br/>\nI seem to recall somewhere that the death flag conviction could increase the total past the max? Or is the death flag conviction only for when characters are desparate, and low on conviction? Basically enforcing the max on it means that a player is disincentivized from exposing their character if they have a lot of conviction already. Is that intentional? Or do you want to allow for full player freedom to choose when to gain those five points? <br/>\n<br/>\nI really like that the GM can attack conviction direcly. That seems key to me. Interestingly, it's useless for a player to spend Conviction on retaining Conviction... Hmmm...<br/>\n<br/>\nMike<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S. Jarrod, it's an easy hack, if he doesn't go with it. Just have them keep a list of three convictions at all times.

So players naturally spend it when it's important to them.  Sometimes "surviving this fight" is important, and sometimes "killing that guy" is more important.  <br/><br/>What I'm saying is that if players decide what's important to them in the moment, rather than in advance, it's still going to work.  I'm leery of write-them-in-advance because that process doesn't capture some stuff that can happen in play.  <br/><br/>For example, say my 3 Drives are:<br/><br/>1) Avenge my father's death<br/>2) Slay orcs<br/>3) Win the heart of the elven princess<br/><br/>Now my buddy next to me, he's got his 3 as well:  <br/>1) Come to terms with my troll blood<br/>2) Find my lost sister<br/>3) Be respected and honored in human society<br/><br/>Now we're in a situation where we may kill the orc that killed my father.  My half-troll buddy  wants to spend Conviction but none of his Drives are relevant, so he can't.  <br/><br/>What's happened there is that something implicit has become important to the character over the course of the game (maybe even just 1 session).  I don't want to kick out of the experience of the scene to have a discussion about changing Drives, nor do I want to have everyone fiating "Well, I guess the desire for respect and umm... troll blood kind of help you kill orcs."                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_133715">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/133715/#Comment_133715" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-10T09:43:59+00:00" title="March 10, 2008  9:43AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mike, these are just the first 6 pages of a longer document.

Basically I want to bring in Keys as the means by which Conviction is gained but have it help the whole party.  I want my quiet supportive player to be rewarded for supporting someone else's Keys even if it means they didn't muscle in themselves.  So this would mean that Conviction could be regenerated in or out of combat but require actual stuff happening in scenes. <br/><br/>Mike, right now the Conviction regen works like this:  You sleep, your Conviction refreshes to 5 points.  If you had more, you keep them, if you had less, you're back to 5.  Certain features like Pride help you get more, although only for yourself, to a maximum of 10.  The Death Flag is supposed to ignore any kind of maximum (but the text doesn't say so, my bad).  <br/><br/>I'd like to change Resting to match the idea that Paul is talking about - spend the Conviction individually but the things that help you regenerate it help the whole group regenerate it.<br/><br/>And here's a link to the full document - such as it is, still lacking edits that pertain to the discussion here.

I love the Cannibalize feature for the Faerie Exile. Perfect!<br/><br/>2. Steven, thanks for confirming! I would definitely go with "roll two dice, take the lowest" for attribute generation and save some math.<br/><br/>3. I like the idea of how all the different combat options are balanced. I mean, in RBH all the weapons are balanced (except for the really heavy ones), but the armor is basically "the heavier, the better".<br/><br/>However, the implementation of the armor sounds a bit problematic to me. Light armor sounds more useful than heavy armor. Consider a hero fighting 10 mooks (or equivalent). If their stats are poor, a +1 defense may cut their chances to hit you by as much as 66% or so, effectively stopping a point of damage every time. And let's not even talk about which you'd rather have facing an enemy that deals 3 points of damage per strike...<br/><br/>Given Ryan's general approach to the design so far, the thing that comes to my mind is something like:<br/><br/>-Light armor gives you a +1 to defense when using Grace or Insight.<br/>-Heavy armor gives a +1 to defense when using Might or Resolve.<br/><br/>Or maybe Light armor is the default (no bonus or penalty), and having no armor gives you the +1 w/ Grace or Insight, and light armor gives a different bonus altogether, like to other types of actions...<br/><br/>3b. This brings up another point--when you have a +1 to defend, how do you decide when it applies and when it doesn't? Enemy's attacking you? OK, that one's clear. How about falling off a cliff? Or an enemy trying to push you somewhere? What about magical attacks like Blast? Etc.<br/><br/>4. Ryan, you were talking about removing all the 1/2 point features--rounding them up to 1, or some other way. How about a making a number of 0-point (free) features, but each character is limited to how many they have--like "choose three Free features"?<br/><br/>Cheers!

I saw it too, but didn't mention it (or did I?).<br/>\n<br/>\nThe problem with his solution is that, on looking at the potential combinations of abilities that armor gets the bonus for defending with, you get one of two possible outcome arrangements:<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Each type of armor only has one weapon that it gets the defense against. In other cases the attacker can choose to void the armor. <br/>\n2. The attacker always has the ability to choose so as to avoid the armor. <br/>\n<br/>\nNeither sounds good. Yes, if the character is wearing heavy armor, you can choose to make his Grace and Insight high to counter... basically heavy armor becomes a hedge against a low Might or Resolve. But this seems counter to the intent of the design. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you allow the defender to choose how to defend, then you can make it so that the armor works against three of the weapons,  but he only has the choice against one. Against the other two, he must choose the correct stat to get the bonus. So, for instance, the way Paul's system works now, if I put on heavy armor, against reach weapons I can choose the higher ability, and get the bonus. Against Light I have to select Might, and against Heavy I have to select Resolve, in order to gain the bonus. <br/>\n<br/>\nThis is nice, because it means that I have to consider both stats. I have to consider the other two, already, for the one in four chance that my opponent has a Ranged weapon. So I have the option to stack behind the armor, or balance out, and behind the armor I have to decide if I'm better against light or heavy, or to balance. <br/>\n<br/>\nThat's a pretty reasonable set of options, with no one method really superior to another. <br/>\n<br/>\nIf you don't like the weapon match-ups, it's a simple matter to switch which ones they attack, and/or which abilities armor gets a bonus for defending against. The only problem with this is that the results might not be intuitive in terms of what ability is used with which weapons, or with either sort of armor. <br/>\n<br/>\nBy the way, using Paul's method, generally, you could include two other options: No armor and medium armor. Or something like that. Each option of which can just have a different combination. If you don't do this, then you may see everyone choose Reach and Ranged weapons, hoping to run into folks in the wrong sort of armor 50% of the time (the other two sorts always leave the opponent a choice of ability to defend with). If you have all four sorts of armor, then all options for weapons are equal. <br/>\n<br/>\nMakes for a nice symetry, too, of course... :-)<br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134340">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134340/#Comment_134340" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T09:45:01+00:00" title="March 12, 2008  9:45AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Well argued.

Crossposted, despite the 30 min difference)<br/>\n<br/>\nOh. Then I think we're very close. The only "problems" are coming up with which combinations of weapons and armors work well against which. <br/>\n<br/>\nBeing into complexity, myself... I'd probably use up the combinations in total. That is, you have only 4. But there are actually 6 possible combinations (twelve permutations, but half of those are the reverse of the other half - insight and might is the same as might and insight):<br/>\n<br/>\nMight and Insight<br/>\nMight and Resolve<br/>\nMight and Grace<br/>\nInsight And Resolve<br/>\nInsight and Grace<br/>\nResolve and Grace<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you could have six armor types, and six weapon types. A particular armor would then only be trumped by one sixth of weapons, and be best against one sixth, and be OK against two thirds. Not sure if this is an improvement over the 25/50/25 split for four weapon types. <br/>\n<br/>\nAny concern that I personally have with regards to whether or not these things are assigned "right" is purely a color thing that asumes that armor options are equal. Which is a bogus RPG assumption from the get-go. I assume we're just buying into it. Because any discussion of how people "move" in different sorts of armor is actually ridiculous. Full plate armor is, at worst, fatiguing to some extent, but doesn't slow down it's occupant one bit... or it would never be worn. The fact is that heavier armor is almost always better than lighter armor, no matter what weapon your opponent wields. It's just a desire to have balanced options in RPGs that makes us come up with the conceit about less armor meaning more dodging, etc. A fun one, yes. But any appeal to "This is how it really is" that tries to be balanced is just wrong. <br/>\n<br/>\nReality doesn't make for a fun game here, so just ignore it, and move on. <br/>\n<br/>\nMike                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_134366">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134366/#Comment_134366" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T10:55:57+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 10:55AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 10:56AM by Ry.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ooh, serves me for editing a post.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134367">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes" title="Mike_Holmes"><img alt="Mike_Holmes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Holmes">Mike_Holmes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134367/#Comment_134367" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-12T10:57:08+00:00" title="March 12, 2008 10:57AM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 12, 2008 10:58AM by Mike_Holmes.">edited March 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Looking at what you have in your post before my post, don't call these armor, but the player is selecting his mode of Protection.

I think symetry is a good thing, if and only if you don't have to make even one compromise to get it. If you do, then skip it. Asymetrical is good. Unbalanced is not good, but balanced asymetrically is always fun. <br/>\n<br/>\nNow, that said, I'm simply seeing more opportunity here for complicizing things (a Mike-ism meaning complicating things potentially unneccessarily). How about the weapon type dictates the six combinations of defense, but the specific weapon can vary in terms of the ability used. That means that, suddenly, you have 24 potential weapons. Four abilities times six defense combinations. <br/>\n<br/>\nSo you have:<br/>\nRanged: Must defend against with Grace or Insight<br/>\nAttack with:<br/>\n - Insight - Crossbow<br/>\n - Grace - throwing knife<br/>\n - Might - Longbow<br/>\n - Resolve - Sling<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd then similar for the other five attack types. <br/>\n<br/>\nOr, again, stick with your original idea, and make this "effect first" and have the player decide on what the weapon is that he wants to attack with Might, and forced Grace or Insight defense.

Meaning that any stat as defense makes sense for any weapon. Meaning that, to me, it's not going to make one whit of difference which combinations you choose. If you go with the second version, I'm going to wonder why somebody can't withstand a heavy weapon blow with resolve... after all, that's a counter to massive damage, no? If you go with the first version I'm going to wonder why you can't dodge the heavy weapon. And in both cases I'm going to wonder why somebody can't just have the smarts to stay out of the way of such a weapon with Insight....<br/>\n<br/>\nI think "because it's fun to have these limits" is probably good enough here. No? <br/>\n<br/>\nAgain, I'm thinking matrix, perhaps. Cross-reference each weapon with all four defenses, to find a bonus or penalty.

Heavy weapons aren\u2019t fancy or elegant, but deal lots of damage.  You take a -1 penalty on your attack, but when you hit, you deal an extra point of damage.   Heavy weapons use Might.<br/><br/>LIGHT WEAPON<br/>You carry a Light weapon.  Light weapons are small, easy to wield, easy to conceal and handy for getting chinks in an enemy\u2019s armor.  You get a +1 bonus on attack.  Light weapons use Grace.<br/><br/>RANGED WEAPON<br/>You carry a Ranged weapon.  You may attack targets in nearby Zones with a ranged weapon.  Ranged weapons use Insight.<br/><br/>REACH WEAPON<br/>You carry a Reach weapon.  Reach weapons are very long and you can use them to keep your enemies at bay.  When you defend and are using a Reach weapon, add 1 to your defense.  Reach weapons use Resolve.<br/> <br/>---ARMOR---<br/><br/>LIGHT ARMOR<br/>Light armor is very basic, and is fairly thin (like leather armor) or covers just the part of your body you intend to show your enemy (like a shield or a breastplate).  Light armor uses Grace.  Light armor is very mobile and gives a +1 bonus against Heavy weapons.<br/><br/>HARD ARMOR<br/>Hard armor covers most of your body and is typically made from metal.  Hard armor uses Resolve.  Hard armor is good at deflecting attacks and gives a +1 bonus against Ranged weapons.<br/><br/>THICK ARMOR<br/>Thick armor can be made from lots of different materials, and covers a good part of your body.  You use Might to defend in Thick armor and ignore the first point of damage in every battle.  Thick armor gives a +1 bonus against Light weapons.<br/><br/>STRANGE ARMOR<br/>Strange armor includes heavy robes and magical tattoos.  Strange armor uses Insight to defend.  Strange armor is hard to gauge an attack on and gives a +1 bonus against Reach weapons.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_134719">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/134719/#Comment_134719" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-03-13T16:52:16+00:00" title="March 13, 2008  4:52PM">March 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            But honestly, this stuff is all peripheral.

I totally agree about the focus on Conviction, etc., but<br/><br/>2. I really like where you ended up with the weapons/armor thing. The "Strange Armor" could also depict weird fighting styles or what-not.<br/><br/>If you're really concerned about the rationale for using or not using certain stats to defend, another way to do it might be:<br/><br/>Armor X: Gives +1 to defend with _this_ stat, but also allows to defend with _this_ stat/s (no bonus). Maybe like: "Heavy armor. +1 to defend with Might and Resolve, -1 to defend with Insight, may not defend with Grace."<br/><br/>It could also be interesting to make them fighting styles, so you could adapt your tactics ("OK, I'm going to in Heavy against this guy, but I'm not as good at that as I am at being Graceful...").                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
