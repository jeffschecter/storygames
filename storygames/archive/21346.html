Later in 2016 I posted there an embryo of what would then evolve into a thorough reimagining of the whole game.<br/><br/>The current project draws deeply from <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23ApocalypseWorld2&amp;Mode=like">#ApocalypseWorld2</a>  and <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23DungeonWorld&amp;Mode=like">#DungeonWorld</a> and some cool ideas I've seen floating around in other projects, like the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%23Stonetop&amp;Mode=like">#Stonetop</a> one. But it then goes down the rabbit hole following my own personal design goals and aesthetic.<br/><br/>*I'm currently looking for comments, opinions and critiques* on its various game elements (harm, basic moves, class moves, etc) while I work on packaging it all in something that could be actually used in a normal game session.<br/>The complete WIP design gdoc is available to my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/unPlayableGames" rel="nofollow">Patreons</a>, but here I would like to focus on a single element at a time, to make the discussion easier to follow and more fruitful.<br/><br/>Other threads in the series:<br/>- <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21322/unplayable-fantasy-pbta-fictional-harm-system" rel="nofollow">Fictional Harm System</a><br/>- <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21332/unplayable-fantasy-pbta-violence-moves" rel="nofollow">Violence Moves</a><br/>- <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/discussion/21346/unplayable-fantasy-pbta-basic-moves" rel="nofollow">Basic Moves</a><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467277">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467277/#Comment_467277" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-27T13:45:54+00:00" title="October 27, 2017  1:45PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CLARITY &amp; USABILITY</span></b><br/>[This is not in the book; it is just me commenting on the following mechanics]<br/><br/>As mentioned in other posts I find that a fundamental problem most PbtA games have is an underlying vagueness and ambiguity in a few critical places.<br/>It is good, for me, to leave blank spaces so that Players and GM can fill them with their creativity.<br/>It is less good, and potentially problematic, when those blanks make the game procedure muddy and unclear, requiring discussions and negotiations in order to understand if/when/how to use the game mechanics.<br/><br/>The work I've done with the Basic Moves goes in the direction of fixing such problems, in an attempt to bake right into the moves what is usually only expressed in the broader rulebook text in the form of suggestions, guidelines and best practices.<br/>My very personal view is that if a "<i>best practice</i>" exists at all, then it should <b>BE</b> the rule, not just a subsequent addendum to clarify the rule in the (inevitable?) case that someone at the table has doubts.<br/><br/>I've used as a base the moves from AW2, then expander or modified them both to fit the fantasy genre, to recall DW memories, and to serve my needs and goals.<br/><br/>One very obvious element is the clear spelling out of when the GM is given a Soft or Hard move to make. This is intended to supplant the general rule about "<i>on a 6- make a move as hard as you want</i>".<br/>Too many times I've seen GMs behave in a way I dislike because of (also) this snippet of rules.<br/>That is, when a Move has a specific 1-6 effect it is applied as an addition to the customary freely chosen GM Hard Move; so that on a 1-6 the Player suffers 2 Hard moves.<br/>This usually becomes the crack in the wall that eventually spirals gameplay back into a much more "traditional" mold where the GM ignores rules and procedures in favor of just winging whatever they feel appropriate for a situation: in my experience this turns out 9 times out of 10 as very low quality play... with either too bland or too harsh consequences that rarely move the fiction in meaningful ways.<br/><br/>It's a subtle association of ideas, a <b>slippery slope</b> that plays on the "old habits" of many players.<br/>Apparently, I can make 2 Hard moves in these A B C instances.<br/>So, I can make more than 1 Hard move at a time, as a general possibility.<br/>So, I can find other occasion where multiple Hard moves would fit.<br/>So, I can make multiple Hard moves whenever I feel it appropriate.<br/>So, I can use multiple Hard moves to represent more complex situations and consequences.<br/>So, I can ignore the Hard move list and its rules and limits because (at this point) it is just <b>so much easier</b> to wing consequences out of the top of my head whenever I need to, and <b>still</b> believe that I'm following the rules.<br/>I have seen this happen countless times, and in time I have "<i>reverse engineered</i>" the whole mental process leading to this, by discussing with many GM "<i>why are you behaving like this?</i>".<br/><br/>I hope with my rules and moves to, among other things, make it as difficult as possible for people to go down this path.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467278">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir" title="Hasimir"><img alt="Hasimir" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/174/nMMN7EIWIKON4.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Hasimir">Hasimir</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467278/#Comment_467278" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-10-27T13:46:11+00:00" title="October 27, 2017  1:46PM">October 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            .<br/>..<br/>...<br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Defy Danger</span></b>\n<blockquote>When you take action in the face of immediate danger, under great pressure or despite adverse odds...<br/><br/>...describe how you do it and roll.<br/>If you do it by means of...<br/>.. brawn &amp; power\t\t+STR<br/>.. speed &amp; finesse\t\t+DEX<br/>.. endurance &amp; stamina\t+CON<br/>.. cleverness &amp; witt\t\t+INT<br/>.. resolve &amp; knowledge\t+WIS<br/>.. charm &amp; social grace\t+CHA<br/><br/>10+\t= you do it <b>and</b> ... describe an additional positive side effect<br/>7-9\t= you do it <b>but</b> ... describe a negative side effect, or a positive one but granting the GM a Soft Move<br/>6-\t= Hard Move<br/></blockquote>\n.<br/>..<br/>...<br/><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Discern Realities</span></b>\n<blockquote>When you observe something the GM will tell you what is obvious and clear.
