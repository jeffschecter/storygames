We recently made up characters for a D&amp;D 4e campaign that I\u2019m thinking of killing for lack of time.  I\u2019m hoping an InSpectres one-shot might be just the ticket to change gears.  <br/>\n<br/>\nTo that end I\u2019m thinking of running two short adventures with a set of pre-gens back-to-back, which I\u2019m hoping is feasible in about 3 hours.  I\u2019m trading the character and franchise creation (which sound great) to run the two scenarios to demonstrate the franchise dice economy (which sounds like a critical part of the game that is missed completely if only a single scenario is played.)<br/>\n<br/>\nI\u2019d love any thoughts or advice you can offer.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199628">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto" title="jim pinto"><img alt="jim pinto" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/500/nJ276DTFUPELH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jim%20pinto">jim pinto</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199628/#Comment_199628" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-30T22:11:06+00:00" title="March 30, 2009 10:11PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Every game of Inspectres I've played has been fantastic, and ultimately ruined by the GM who thought he/she needed to be involved in every detail of the game.<br/><br/>It runs so smoothly and effortlessly, that the GM can really relax with this one.<br/><br/>That's my two cents.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199639">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ping" title="ping"><img alt="ping" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/41dd9b29bf2b05c9bd9b60bb5a720410?s=32&amp;d=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D32&amp;r=G"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ping">ping</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199639/#Comment_199639" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T00:05:25+00:00" title="March 31, 2009 12:05AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2009 12:18AM by ping.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love InSpectres as well.

The franchise dice system is not super critical -- it's just dice. Like jim pinto says, remember the GM does next to nothing and the players do everything else. The key to the game is not the mechanics, but getting the players motivated to investigate and excited to come up with solutions to the mystery. So, if the players aren't sufficiently invested in their characters, it could be really hard to get them to step up and participate. The GM sits back and steers the game occasionally when it drifts, puts in some stress dice and does a little roleplaying here and there - that's it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199642">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands" title="Mike_Sands"><img alt="Mike_Sands" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/376/nHOYKHPGXZN6O.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mike_Sands">Mike_Sands</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199642/#Comment_199642" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T01:42:06+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  1:42AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2009 1:42AM by Mike_Sands.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't need to make pre-generated characters for a 3 hour, 2 investigation game of InSpectres.

Don't feel you need to ask all the listed questions.<br/><br/>It's very easy to blow straight through low-franchise dice mysteries very quickly. Pay a lot of attention to how many franchise dice have been acquired and accelerate the pace of events accordingly. A seven or eight dice franchise (therefore requiring 14-16 dice to complete the mystery) sounds about right.<br/><br/>The book says this, but I'll stress it: don't prepare any aspect of events whatever. Describe some phenomena and then sit back and play reactively. Let the players define what the mystery is.<br/><br/>You need to call for stress rolls early and often or you will find that the characters will overwhelm the mystery very quickly and might not even need to use their franchise dice. Start with one die stresses, which provide the opportunity to accumulate cool. Use the opportunity of any roll of a four or lower as an excuse to spring a stress on the player. Pacing the number and severity of stress rolls is pretty much the <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a> thing to get right as an InSpectres GM.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199659">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings" title="Jon Hastings"><img alt="Jon Hastings" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jon%20Hastings">Jon Hastings</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199659/#Comment_199659" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T06:08:27+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  6:08AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On Stress Rolls:<br/><br/>One of the things that helped me GM was remembering to call for Stress rolls for mundane, everyday office-centric b.s.

I\u2019ll probably go ahead and have the players make characters then, but with an accelerated franchise creation as Jon suggested and low franchise dice and low dice missions.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks Mike for pointing out the general advice in the \u201cInSpace\u201d supplement.  It looked awesome when I downloaded it earlier, but I thought it would be something to try at a later date.  Now reading it, it does have great tips that will work for any InSpectres game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAn idea for the first client: the characters meet a husband and wife in a discreet location who are opening a very posh art gallery.  In planning their opening they slighted a voodoo shaman/sorcerer (to be filled in by the players in play) that thought his avant-garde performance pieces belonged in the showing, or who was in love with one of the couple.  One of the couple doesn\u2019t believe the InSpectres are needed at all.  Long story short: the characters are supposed to keep a very low profile during the high society gallery opening and keep ghosts and goblins at bay.  I picture a scene where a creature has caught the governor\u2019s wife in his glamour, maybe a scene where the characters realize a goblin hole just opened under a table of dining guests.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother idea to introduce low stress roles as well as have the players introduce their characters: sprinkled during the first mission, ask a player, \u201cWhat is stressing your character outside of work right now?\u201d  Player narrates a little cut scene that illuminates his home life, followed by a 1 or 2 stress roll, then back to the mission where we see how the home life is affecting our agent.

You have to be prepared to throw *all* of that away in play if the players take things in a different direction. I've found that it's useful to have a basic plot in my mind to set the initial scenes, but it's important that you don't try and prevent the players narrating what they want to when they win the rolls. The analogy I've used before is that my prepared plot is the 'working theory' of what the mystery is, but that anything in there is liable to be overruled by what happens in play.<br/><br/>I think that asking the players what is stressing the character out is probably not the best way to go. Instead, pick on things that they mentioned during character generation or, as Jon said, just go with the mundane office stuff for stress rolls. The results of crappy gear rolls when building the franchise are often good for stress rolls later, in particular. "You go to get some coffee from the old possessed coffee machine in the basement: stress roll!"                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199780">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199780/#Comment_199780" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T15:09:54+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  3:09PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 31, 2009 3:14PM by Jesse.">edited March 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roy,<br/><br/>I'm going to go one further than Mike and say that you've said too much about the situation.  Have you seen the structure of play stuff in the book.  The Research, Suiting Up, Field Work stuff?  That's not just "advice" that's how the game is played.  You haven't presented them with a mystery to solve, you've presented them with a situation to deal with.  You're at a party and your goal is to keep ghosts away: GO!<br/><br/>InSpectres is supposed to be a Clue-Chain-Mystery style game alla Call of Cthulhu but with two twists.  The first twist is that the players make up all their own clues (mostly, unless they roll badly).  The second is that beyond just following the clues to the big baddie, those clues often produce real-world office management type level complications (that's YOUR job as the GM).<br/><br/>Seriously this is how I started my last InSpectres game: "Hi, I"m from the zoo.  We have a problem in our lion cage.  Something keeps really freaking out the animals.  Man, no offense but are you guys it?  I mean, I know the city cut our funding and everything but you sure don't look like much."<br/><br/>And that's it.

You have let go of everything you've ever associated with the term "GM" or "DM". You can roleplay all the interesting characters such as the gallery owners as they come up, but you cannot GM in the traditional way by leading the players - remember the players decide what's going on too. You have to really explain to the players that when they win rolls, they can dictate the scenes and describe what happens and they don't have to check with the GM or anything. They have the power. If you think the answer to "what's the hole under the table" is that it's a goblin hole, you might never get the chance to make it true if the players win a roll and say it's a hole to another dimension. You might think a shaman is behind the ghosts but then the player investigates, wins a roll and decides a secret government agent is really behind it. That's how it works.<br/><br/>Re your scenario: From what you've written, ask yourself, what's the mystery? What's the question the players are supposed to answer? If there are no questions, then you don't have a good starting premise. If they're just supposed to keep some ghosts at bay, that's not a mystery, that's a task like "clear out the dungeon" which is not InSpectres.<br/><br/>Possible mysteries from your scenario:<br/>"Why are ghosts and goblins haunting the art gallery opening?"<br/>or even broader<br/>"What are the strange noises that people keep hearing at night in the art gallery?"<br/><br/>You pose your mystery question and you sit back and do nothing. Really. Nothing. The players decide what to do next while you sit on your hands and try not to say anything.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_199801">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199801/#Comment_199801" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-31T16:25:25+00:00" title="March 31, 2009  4:25PM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Ping and Jesse are wise.

The main objectives I want to fulfill during that interview:<br/>\n<br/>\nA. establish a mission setup that has potential for both tension (undefined spooks) and comedy (uptight blue bloods meet particle projector-wielding egg heads, or ex special ops guys, or whatever they turn out to be).<br/>\n<br/>\nB. give a little direction of where to start investigation, even if those are red herrings that the players, through successful dice rolls, dismiss.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith a rather green group, I think I need to throw out a couple of waypoints on the map, even if the topography is still undefined, you know?  And with the system, if they've got a story groove on, they can just ignore the waypoints.  <br/>\n<br/>\nBut I'll scale it back a bit given the comments here.  Maybe just a concerned husband hires the party to protect his wife's gallery opening without her knowledge, saying she should never know they were even there, but not explaining why.

Especially in early franchise mysteries, I would often find the characters at the mystery solution (or close) after a single scene - which wasn't very mystery-like.  I since put a cap on the amount of franchise dice you can accrue in a scene; the players could keep roleplaying and making dice rolls after that, but the dice didn't actually add to the mystery pool.  Make sense?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor example - if we have a 15 dice mystery, I might say that each scene has a max of 5 dice - thus ensuring we have at minimum 3 scenes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200826">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roy" title="Roy"><img alt="Roy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roy">Roy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200826/#Comment_200826" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-05T23:31:25+00:00" title="April  5, 2009 11:31PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for both comments.<br/>\n<br/>\nRegarding Xaak's comment about approximate dice caps for scenes to help pacing: would it make sense to have those approximate caps for the Contact/Investigation/Suiting Up/Assault parts of the adventure?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_200959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jared%20A.%20Sorensen" title="Jared A.

All of these cautions and corrections are useful buffers against the gap between a new GM's expectations and what InSpectres really is.  There are habits to be broken, as evinced above.  Obviously, you would have broken those habits no later than when the game gelled into its current form; the rest of us have some technical catching-up to do, is all.  <br/><br/>We, mystery game GMs, are used to having "the answer," and now we're being told to go collect "the answer" as it's distributed among the many minds at the table. Having done it both ways myself, I can testify that it's like suddenly zenning distributed parallel programming, or having the epiphany that a market economy is actually a simpler thing than a planned one, or that evolution is actually simpler than design.  It's also like suddenly finding the courage to jump off that high cliff into the water.  Letting order emerge from the interactions of many actors, rather than imposing it from the top down, means learning a whole new set of skills, and transferring your weight all at once from your old skillset to the new.  It's scary and exciting, and getting a little advice from other people who have gone before definitely helps.<br/><br/>Jared, I imagine that if you have any response to this, you'll say that the way I (and I would guess "we") have been GMing is bad, stupid, unfun, and pointless, that it provides at best an illusion of authorship to non-GM players.  I (and again, I would guess "we", everyone in this thread) concede in advance that you're right.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_200978">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/200978/#Comment_200978" name="Item_18" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-06T14:17:33+00:00" title="April  6, 2009  2:17PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jared A.

I had two players that have come a few times and one brand new guy, so everyone took a bit to really get their creativity engaged.  I pushed things along fairly quickly so we wouldn\u2019t get stalled.  It was a bit stuttering, but I think we all had quite a good time.  <br/><br/>No confessionals were used (perhaps because I was pushing a little too hard), nor were any card dice.  I thought I was being a bit of a dick using stress even as little as I did, and it felt fairly random and arbitrary when I hit them with it, but apparently it wasn\u2019t enough.  Only one person lost a single die from a skill.<br/><br/>I noticed that in Ben Robbins\u2019 InSpace supplement, he suggests that the stress dice used in a mission should approximately equal the franchise dice.  Here\u2019s one idea to help pace them: for every die gained towards the franchise dice goal of the mission, you also set aside one stress die.  If players have a good reason in the fiction to call for a stress test, they can roll them to get rid of them.  If not, the stress pool accumulates.  When a player rolls a 1 or 2 on a skill check, they roll all the dice in the stress pool.  Everyone should help with the fiction to justify it.<br/><br/>This would encourage players to be looking for ways to screw over their characters frequently to keep the stress pool from getting too high.  Players could do this by bringing in stress from their normal life between mission scenes or forcing their characters to roll their low skills.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_211083">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/211083/#Comment_211083" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-09T11:41:42+00:00" title="June  9, 2009 11:41AM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Roy,<br/><br/>Mastering the Stress Dice is probably the single greatest skill an InSpectres GM needs to cultivate.

Getting players to use the confessional should be encouraged, but for asides and explanations, the game altering parts of confessionals should follow the rules laid out in the text.\n<blockquote><br/>A last quick observation: when I was trying to think of good media to set the tone, besides Ghostbusters or Men in Black, I thought Shaun of the Dead might fit the bill\u2026 the juxtaposition of the brutally mundane with fantastical horror, presented hilariously.<br/></blockquote>\nThat juxtaposition is important, but do not forget that Reality Television should be at least as big a part of your game as Ghostbusters. Though perhaps now it is the parody of Reality Television that should be encouraged in Inspectres. When the game was written Reality TV was still quite young and it's conventions and affectations where still being worked out, now we have shows like the Office and Reno 911 and other parodies of Reality TV that hit much closer to the mark for how to interpret Reality TV for Inspectres.<br/><br/>Once you've got Ghostbusters and Reality TV then the third pillar of Inspectres is crappy jobs and start up corporations. Everyone has had at least one crappy job that they can draw on to understand the world of Inspectres and how their character fits into it. If they've had the experience of starting their own business, or working for some start up corporation that only provides more grist for the mill. <br/><br/>Which is why it would probably be a mistake to skip franchise creation, part of the fun comes from saying "We need a coffee machine for the office" rolling the dice and then seeing just what kind of coffee machine your start up franchise has. A gleaming copper plated espresso machine of titanic proportions, a garage sale Mr. Coffee, or a demonically possessed percolator that produces coffee from the bitter, burnt, and blacken souls of a thousand sinners which no amount of milk or nondairy creamer can bring to the light. By going through the office and outfitting the franchise and leaving the quality of those objects up to the dice you mimic the feel of a start up business perfectly, it creates the fictional space and highlights what's important to that particular group of Inspectres. As for making Technology rolls during the suit up phase that is perfectly acceptable and should indeed be encouraged. But don't skip out on the franchise creation phase as it would make for a poorer game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212177">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roy" title="Roy"><img alt="Roy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roy">Roy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212177/#Comment_212177" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-13T21:27:45+00:00" title="June 13, 2009  9:27PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the tips guys.  The points re: more confessional chair = mo bettah and working out the nitty gritty of the office I'll especially make a point of implementing.<br/><br/>Given that we're a pretty fresh off the press group I still think something to help force stress dice into play would be a help.  Maybe I'll have a bowl of green beads on the table for that mission's franchise dice and a bowl of red beads for stress dice.  If players see the green beads are getting low but lots of red beads remain, then they know the finale is going to be an ass-kicking.  <br/><br/>Which could be a good thing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_212224">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jesse" title="Jesse"><img alt="Jesse" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jesse">Jesse</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212224/#Comment_212224" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-14T12:30:40+00:00" title="June 14, 2009 12:30PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Roy</cite>Given that we're a pretty fresh off the press group I still think something to help force stress dice into play would be a help.

You're the GM right?  It's YOUR job to introduce Stress.  The players don't need to worry about introducing Stress.  I know some people play the game a little looser where a high die roll means the player can narrate whatever they want including additional complications but I take a more strict interpretation.  When the players rolls a 4, 5 or 6 that means the situation is going well for the characters and they get to narrate how they make positive progress (i.e. No Stress).  When the die comes up 1 2 or 3 that means things are going poorly for the players and the GM must introduce a complication which pretty much means Stress.  Similarly when things stall the GM need to introduce material to stir things up that's usually (but not always) Stress as well.<br/><br/>Jesse                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_212229">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Roy" title="Roy"><img alt="Roy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Roy">Roy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/212229/#Comment_212229" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-06-14T13:29:13+00:00" title="June 14, 2009  1:29PM">June 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 14, 2009 9:04PM by Roy.">edited June 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse<br/>I'm not sure I even understand this suggestion.

The result was that the game was fun, but did not tax the PC's.<br/><br/>To those who suggest to add more stress in the game, I hear you.  I will try it.  But because of the "new group" awkwardness at the table, that solution may not be enough.  <br/><br/>In traditional RPG's it's obvious why your character is getting his ass kicked...that's in the adventure.  And usually no one character is singled out.  If characters take stress for failing rolls, doesn't that just encourage very conservative play?  System matters, right?<br/><br/>So I proposed an alternate rule based solution that would A. add more authorship for the players, which might be positive, B. make it less awkward to hit the players with stress, because it has to happen anyway to deplete the pool, and C. potentially help with pacing the stress.<br/><br/>If you've played Inspectres and found that the rules as written were sufficient and hitting players with stress for every 1, 2, or 3 roll worked, outstanding.  That didn't work in our first game.  It may work later.  But I also think the "stress pool" idea might be a way to make our game more fun.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
