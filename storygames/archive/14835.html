First, name your character and describe them as an adjective phrase then a noun phrase ("Curious bookseller" or "alcoholic sheriff" or "reckless catburglar".  You are all guests at a high end charity fundraiser, sponsored by the mysterious Tithonus Society, so pick something cool or mysterious or appropriate for a fancy party.  Write this info on your name badge (provided).<br/><br/>When you encounter another character, you can decide what your relationship with them is.  Write a one or two word description of the relationship.  Then give them the card, and roleplay out meeting at the party.  <br/><br/>Each relationship card has six boxes.  Each time you encounter the other person in the relationship, you have the option to escalate the relationship.  "Escalate" in this case means "make more intense and dramatic".  If you escalate, roleplay out a scene where the relationship becomes more prominent and more intense.  More likely to spur you or the other player onto action.  Then write a sentence detailing that escalation on the other side of the card, and give it to your relationship partner.  Eventually, every relationship gets out of hand.<br/> <br/>If there are any conflicts, each player reveals their relationship card most relevant to the conflict.  Whichever has the most checked boxes wins that conflict.<br/><br/><br/>Side 2:<br/><br/><br/>Character 1: ______________<br/>Character 2: ______________ <br/><br/>Hello, we have a relationship together!  Each time you escalate this relationship, check off a box and write a detail about the relationship.  Then give the card to your relationship partner.

The relationships would be two-sided, with the second half of the card also potentially getting passed around a few times.  This would allow for mysteries, lost MacGuffins, etc.  But I'm thinking more about a low-prep LARP, I suppose.

It's a matter of tradition, yes. I'm in a tradition that has explored the effectivity of <i>dialogue techniques</i>, and found gold with them.

I played the married son of the grandfather who hosted the celebration, and made an early speech were I accused him of abusing his children. The celebration went rapidly downhill from that point on.<br/><br/>Contradictions are rare, but if they occur you have to make find out who lied, or who were confused. Or you stop play, and edit. Not a big problem though. I can't recall encountering it at all.<br/><br/>Of course you may say things about other characters; that's one of the great challenges in such a game; to have someone come up to you, and start playing on something you've done, or something you share. <br/><br/>EXAMPLE<br/>A woman may insinuate in conversation that you and she have an affair, with both being married (and you believed, up until now, that your marriage in this game was sound and happy). It's an exciting challenge, so how do you meet it? You play along, of course, and explore the affair, either as a willing participant, or as a man trying to entangle himself from this bad (but lustful) connection.<br/><br/>SUCH A SCENE MAY PLAY OUT LIKE THIS:<br/><br/>She: Hello Mark! (placing a hand on his arm)<br/>He: Hello! (smiling)<br/>She (whispers): Thanks for yesternight!<br/>He: Oh! Uh ... thanks!<br/>She: What do you think of the party?<br/>He: Oh, it's nice.<br/>She (whispers): Meet me under the apple-tree.<br/>She: Must mingle!<br/>He (whispers): I'll be there.<br/>- you split up, and meet under the apple-tree later ...<br/><br/>OR LIKE THIS:<br/><br/>She: Hello Mark! (placing a hand on his arm)<br/>He: Hello! (smiling)<br/>She (whispers): Thanks for yesternight!<br/>He: Oh! Uh ... ja, yesternight ... I would like to talk to you about that.<br/>She: What do you think of the party?<br/>He: Oh, it's nice.<br/>She (whispers): Meet me under the apple-tree.<br/>She: Must mingle!<br/>He (whispers): No, not here! Not this night. I'll see you at lunch tomorrow.<br/>She (pouting, whispers): Why? Don't you like the thrill any more?<br/>He (whispers): I can't talk now. Please. We'll talk tomorrow.<br/>She (whispers): Well ... I could talk to your wife, you know, and tell her something ...<br/>He (whispers): You would not dare!<br/>The host: Hey! Whispering tantalizing secrets? Let me in on it!<br/>- you seizes the opportunity, and leave her with the host.<br/><br/>Having such challenges thrown at you is a thrill. It makes the game as unpredictable as life itself. ;-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
