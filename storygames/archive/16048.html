Not only did he dismantle the largest empire the world had ever seen up to that point...he didn't do it from the rear.  He was not only a general, but a front line ass kicker too.  Overwhelming army about to pound his Macedonians into oblivion?...No prob...Alex grabs a few hundred of his closest pals and like a blood crazed lunatic charges into the midst of them, hacking though enemies like a gardener mowing down weeds until they rout rather than face any more of him.  He was the original Gordian Knot cutting irresistible force.<br/>\n<br/>\nYeah...totally want to play that guy.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut not for those reasons.  That guy is a rather 2 dimensional cardboard cut out.  The kind of hero that fails as a valid protagonist in bad violence porn films.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nLooking beyond the obvious we see a guy who had 3 dreams:  He wanted to reach the Pacific Ocean, he wanted to merge Macedonian and Persian culture, and he wanted to found a dynasty that would stand the test of time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHe failed.  At all of it.  The single most bad ass, ass kicking, world changing human being to have lived up to that point...failed to achieve ANY of his dreams.  All the conquests, all the battles, all the victories...they were just setting the stage for reaching those three things...and in the end...he got none of it.  While most people recognize the career of Alexander the Great as one of heroic accomplishment...I see it as one of the greatest personal tragedies of all time.<br/>\n<br/>\nHis men quit on him before the final push that would have taken him to the sea.<br/>\nDespite his best efforts (both with carrots and pretty heavy sticks) his Macedonians LOATHED Persian culture.  While he was a dedicated Persianophile, his generals rebelled at every attempt made to link the two cultures.<br/>\nAnd the greatest empire ever built didn't survive even a handful of years after his death.<br/>\n<br/>\nTHAT'S the character I want to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd that's why I increasingly find myself less interested in games like Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard or Old School start-at-level-one play.  Those games seek to make things difficult by making characters suck.  In the Burning games the central conceit is to turn regular moment to moment play into a crucible of difficulty with high obs and rules like "No Weasels" designed to turn the screws even tighter.   But when Alexander the Great is in Kick Persian Ass mode...there aren't any "tight screws"...that's not where source of challenge and conflict comes from for a character like him.  Of course, "auto winning" isn't always fun either, I still want the sense of accomplishment that comes from having worked the system effectively to lead to victory.  But you don't get there by having to beg and scrape to assemble 5 dice to roll, only to be told that its an Ob 4 test...Fuck that shit right in the ear.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo far, In a Wicked Age produces about the best play experience of this type I've found (which is probably why I love the game so).  Troll Babe kind of does as well, but the mechanics are so light there's no real sense of system mastery.  I've heard people complaining about the Dogs in the Vineyard advancement system being broken because, after a few sessions, fall out has made your Dog nigh invincible.  Fuck No!  Fall Out just turned your Dog into Alexander the Great...a Baad Mo Fo asskicker...with plenty of room to have his story still end tragically.<br/>\n<br/>\nWhat other games lead to this sort of play?...I suspect Sorcerer would although I've never played more than a one shot of it.  The Mortal Coil game I played at Dreamation did as well, but I suspect that may have been because Don was overly generous in how he applied the rules.  Riddle of Steel definitely could go there, but I didn't (and still don't) get to play it anywhere near as much as I'd like.  I haven't had a chance to play Anima Prime or Mystic Empyrean but that's the sort of play I HOPE they can produce...others?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365783">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365783/#Comment_365783" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T18:59:05+00:00" title="March  7, 2012  6:59PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Mortal Coil is a good match because of the flexibility the group has in setting the "price" for things, you can make a relatively lighthearted game or a grim situation, or a mixture, and if your group is good at taking notes and values consistency (I think consistency is a big part of what you're describing) it stays consistent over the long term. IAWA, you're right, definitely a good choice, but there's a weirdness there:<br><br>I think your struggle is going to be fitting in that "I want my guy to fail at all his long term goals" aspect into  a group with people who may want to achieve theirs, no matter the system.  They are going to be like "wow, you really struggled, you deserve this reward" and you'll be "nope, don't give it to him, take it away!" In IAWA particularly, the negotiation system is really going to break down for you if you start consistently pushing for outcomes that are not in your character's desires.  Like, there won't be any reason to fight against you - you'll just <i>give </i>the other side what they want, so you won't ever have those moments of badassdom or whatnot.  Also, the negotiation + stick aspect of IAWA adjudication is so central I really think you'll have a tough time with it.<br><br>Anyway, it's not insurmountable. If we agree that I'm only ever going to throw characters at you that you have to trod on in order to even get close to your goal (while still falling short), then it'll work.  But everyone really has to be on board with it or else people are going to wonder who exactly cares if this guy reaches his goals or not. If you don't, and they don't, who does? Who in the real world, I mean.                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365786">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns" title="Marshall Burns"><img alt="Marshall Burns" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v53/foolish_Paeter/7525925-1.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Marshall%20Burns">Marshall Burns</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365786/#Comment_365786" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-07T19:21:48+00:00" title="March  7, 2012  7:21PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I don't see why you couldn't use Burning Wheel.

Alexander's going to put the entire world through its paces, but his success or failure will all still depend on fictional positioning. It's entirely typical of a well-played TSoY character to have big dreams, but fail in enabling them all in the end.<br><br>The big difference in terms of system-to-setting between BW and TSoY is that BW postulates a wide range of character competency, while TSoY postulates a very narrow range, forcing you to map the entire world over a few small steps of mechanical competence. You can play it as written, your character's going to be as capable of enabling change as anybody. There's no reasonable heroic arc, your character is going to be mechanically capable for heroics from the start. The real questions will be about thematic and fictional positioning of your character: what he is, what he wants.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365882">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks" title="ChristopherWeeks"><img alt="ChristopherWeeks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ChristopherWeeks">ChristopherWeeks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365882/#Comment_365882" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T06:09:03+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  6:09AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Universalis.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br><br>HeroQuest?                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365894">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl" title="anansigirl"><img alt="anansigirl" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7146/6715461575_a887f6b229_t.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/anansigirl">anansigirl</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365894/#Comment_365894" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T06:46:32+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  6:46AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 6:47AM by anansigirl.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Reign?

The best case scenario is that you will only ever achieve one of your three goals.<br><br>If you rephrase Alexander's third goal of "Wanted to create a dynasty that would be remembered for all time", then that's the one he hit "100" in at the expense of the rest.<br><br>Almost a perfect, PERFECT match for Hero's Banner.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_365958">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365958/#Comment_365958" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T09:46:41+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  9:46AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 8, 2012 9:48AM by Paul_T.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Hero's Banner approach sounds fundamentally like Otherkind Dice, right?<br/><br/>I designed a game a while back (Land of Nodd) which was based on an Otherkind Dice-like mechanic, except it allowed you to take even more "dangers" to increase your chances of success.<br/><br/>Most characters in that game would succeed at their eventual goals, but very much at the price of *why* they wanted to: the price in the end is usually so high that the story comes out somewhat like a tragedy. <br/><br/>For instance, in one story we had a powerful sorcerer who wished to become Emperor. He did so in the end, except he was banished from the real world by some ritual or effect, and thus became the Emperor of the "afterlife" (the Heaven Kingdom, I believe). However, the Heaven Kingdom had been purged, emptied of spirits, reduced to an empty wasteland. So he ruled alone, and his spiritual "body" was reduced to a gibbering infant.<br/><br/>(In my game in particular, the last one or two characters are likely to have even more tragic endings, but in any case this is a "feature" of any game which uses something like the Otherkind Dice mechanic. You break up your ultimate goal into sub-components, and then have to choose one over the others. A good model for a certain type of tragedy, which is probably fitting for this genre.)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_366149">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/366149/#Comment_366149" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-08T20:46:25+00:00" title="March  8, 2012  8:46PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            What is alexs goal and what are the main obstacles to his goal?  find the important decisions alex is making and pitch your game at the level of those decisions - abstract the other stuff<br/><br/>He was a tactical and logistical genius - did he ever loose a decisive battle?  I think you can take the outcomes of battles as a given - you can abstract the battles.
