Maybe the people they're fighting on behalf of want some good propaganda to serve their long-term goals, so now on this mission, they don't just want a victory: they want a <i>clean and good-looking victory</i>.<br/><br/>Whatever their responses are, it'll be interesting, because it's a problem that is entirely separate from their actual job (winning the fight), and how much they engage with that problem is entirely up to them. Maybe they want no part of it -- that's cool, that's fun, there's a lot of meat there to work with. Maybe they want to use shady tactics to win the fight, but now feel like they have to try harder to cover them up -- an interesting challenge they can set for themselves. Maybe they want to really make some great propaganda -- another interesting challenge. Maybe they are appalled by the long-term goals of their current employers and want to switch sides or sabotage things from the inside -- that makes this scenario a turning point for the whole game, and those always stand out.<br/><br/>So that's my advice: figure out an interesting big picture to put around the kind of scenario you're running, and a way that the big picture can demand a response from the characters within the context of the scenario, then see what they do with it. Ideally, "we do nothing different" should be as interesting an answer as anything else, because now you can use the next scenario to show how the big picture has changed as a result. Little by little, you end up opening up all of those self-contained scenarios without breaking their basic structure to do it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
