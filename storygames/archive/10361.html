I mean, in-fiction they're always under terrible threats, and we're in the audience ooh-and-aahing right along, but really, we know they're going to survive.  <br/><br/>I was also thinking about old-school gaming, the kind where the rules are mostly physics engine simmy, and there aren't really hero-points or that kinda stuff. Also, the kind of gaming where there is at least a little bit of player competitiveness, but mostly of a bragging-rights type.<br/><br/>Anyway, this stuff is noodling around in my brain, mostly because I've recently moved and met up with an old buddy of mine who iis more into traddy style games.<br/><br/>Now what I'm pondering is hacking some kind of old-school game, but up at the player level rather than down at the character/fiction level. What I'm thinking is something along the  lines of  when Our Hero buys it by the normal rules of the game, the thing kicks into "cliff-hanger" mode, like aqn old Saturday Morning Serial movie and there's some sort of Game-role rotation. Basically, the character player and GM and any other playerrs flip who is doing what ( or possibly simply rotate those Game-roles to the left or something).<br/><br/>Our Hero<b> will</b> survive of course:  captued, escaped at the last moment, rescued by a comrade, whatever. But the actual players will have changed hats. Someone new will be playing Our Hero and someone else will be GM. I don't really have a clear vision of what exactly the other players will be doing during the times they aren't one of those two, but backup/secondary characters seem like obvious choices.<br/><br/>The thing is, for this Little Idea, this is about as far as I've gotten, so I'm looking for ideas on how to cook this one up a bit.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_230394">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Joshua%20A.C.%20Newman" title="Joshua A.C.

Most of Commando Cody takes place in the suburbs of Los Angeles The Moon, with ray guns and the like, so there aren't many regular ol' cars. There's an entire "story" that focuses on the existence of a tank, though, and they've obviously spent their $500 budget on making this "tank", cuz they show it all the time. It's unclear if there's supposed to be more than one tank, or if it's one really threatening tank, but they show it at every opportunity. At the end of the budget story, they blow it up!!!!<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure those stories were written by the 8-year-old kinds in their own audiences. They're <em>really</em> shaggy-doggy.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
