First thing I'd say is to focus on what type of story you want to play -- what's the premise?

A dose of spy/sabotage topped off with a hint of deadly violence. I like the idea of serialized play of PTA but think i could port that over to any other indie sys quite easily. <br/><br/>I was aware of the Twilight Imperium RPG, but im not interested in Trad.games and i like the way that  the boardgame doesnt give you all the details,  but still gives us enough to give us all of the "feeling". It seems the right amount of detail is given by the boardgame to fit in any type of story the way we want that twilight universe to be.<br/><br/>I don't like: Skill lists! (dont ask)  Excessive Crunch! (weapon damage tables,  etc. etc.)<br/>I Like: Focus of rules on Story! <br/>I Like: to have the charactes paint the background (the way the war unfolds as well as details) the players need Lotso narrative power. <br/>I Like: personalized dramas.<br/><br/><br/>I have limited internet access so it might not respond as fast as others but be assured im very happy with all your great ideas! <br/><br/>cheers!<br/><br/>timeLESS                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_164938">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/gmdice" title="gmdice"><img alt="gmdice" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.gmdice.com/prodimages/02019.jpg.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/gmdice">gmdice</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/164938/#Comment_164938" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T10:34:43+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 10:34AM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello Timeless,<br/>\n<br/>\nI am actually testing an RPG game for Richard Hatch (from BSG not Survivor) right now. It is based on a new movie he is working on called the Great War of Magellan. http://greatwarofmagellan.com<br/>\n<br/>\nThe universe he builds is very similar to the Twilight Universe but everyone is adapted or modified humans. Basic gist is...<br/>\n<br/>\nOld race of humans colonized the Clouds of Magellan and started many colonies. The great race vanishes and the human races each lose contact with each other and evolve differently according to their own world. Old race comes back and a great war starts again. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe mechanics are different to me from most rpgs I have played (rolling for a middle score rather than a high or a low) but so far it plays well. This could be easily adapted to the Twilight universe just requiring the races to be made (variables changes, bonuses, deficiencies put into place etc.) There are already about a dozen different human styles with their own abilities including low tech, high tech etc so adapting these to the races of Twilight should be a weekend task for a good crew.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are still hit bonuses, weapon bonuses etc but if each player has their character sheet done right that and dice should be all you need to play.<br/>\n<br/>\nPolitics, Technology, Action, Objectives, Racial Diversity, Ancient races and History are all important in play just like with TI so I feel adapting it would be a fun if not simple thing to do. The game is still in the Alpha/Beta stages but so far it plays well.<br/>\n<br/>\nGMDice,                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_165161">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Deckard" title="Deckard"><img alt="Deckard" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Deckard">Deckard</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/165161/#Comment_165161" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-08-25T23:54:45+00:00" title="August 25, 2008 11:54PM">August 2008</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited August 25, 2008 11:55PM by Deckard.">edited August 2008</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello again.<br/>\n<blockquote class="Quote UserQuote">\n<div class="QuoteText">I don't like: Skill lists!
