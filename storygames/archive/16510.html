"Dude, we got the band back together" is all well and good, but "Dude, our music killed Godzilla" resonates at a whole different level. That said, it's to a certain extent lazy always going for the big pay-off, much in the same way as combat is the lazy kind of conflict. Stories that are more satisfying (than the Hollywood blockbuster such as Independence Day) often look at the tiny victories and defeats, the ones which are more scaled to the person and, for that reason, are more touching.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378188">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378188/#Comment_378188" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T07:31:50+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  7:31AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The problem with the epic resolution is that you get drawn into the Golden of SF trap. So the enemy has a new ray gun which fires mesons, so you start slinging comets at them and before you know it, nothing less than colliding galaxies will do as a weapons system. You have to get bigger each time because epic is always more than you currently have. This is fine for one shots, and is the typical conclusion of a Call of Cthulhu scenario, but for campaign play you need to build more slowly through smaller and more personal victories, having only one or two epic events per arc. Unless you really do like gonzo.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378189/#Comment_378189" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T07:36:54+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  7:36AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            C'mon, don't tell me why epic is lame, Steve.

With an epic, your choices have extraordinary resonance; they can change the nature of the entire setting; they invoke the awful majesty of macroscopic events. <br/><br/>Last year, in the AD&amp;D game I've been running on and off for more than 30 years, we played out the climax of a four / five year multi-weekend fest. It involved a vast invasion force preparing to invade the homeland of the players (not the first time this has happened) but also a ritual which ended with a vast tsunami heading towards their lands. The players' actions decided the end result, and it went down to a last second decision by a single player. If they had failed (and there was a good chance of it), the entire coast and most of the lands cities, all of which they had played in for many, many years, would have been destroyed. Their choices, their successes had consequences.  Sure, in a one-off game, you get a Transformers-style buzz out of massive destructions and huge stakes, but, as with lower level drama, it's better if the players are emotionally attached to the outcome.<br/><br/>They diverted the waters so they slaughtered the vast army which faced them. This year - aquatic zombie invasion. Or some necromantic energy, at least.<br/><br/>Heroes need challenges worthy of them.

Epic stakes are vast, global, galactic, wide-screen. And the higher the tension, the worse the odds, the more threatening the opposition or obstacle, the more epic the resolution becomes.<br/><br/>Also, sometimes things are epic because of random chance: it just so happened in this particular way, and no one had any control over it, but it turned out just the right way, and it was glorious. Rolling 3 consecutive natural 20s in a game of D&amp;D, for instance.<br/><br/>Here's another example: in a miniatures-based superhero action game, in an eight-foot-long papercraft city that I'd built, Green Lantern and the Hulk and all those dudes were squaring off against a horrific enemy (Darkseid and Thanos had merged into a single supervillain named OverCross, and he'd deployed all these bad guys to pick off the heroes one by one). After sustaining some casualties, the superheroes were able to defeat the army of evil and smite them an all that. It was close -- the heroes were in a bad way, but they were fighting on against the last couple bad guys.<br/><br/>The Hulk jumped atop a building and glared down at Solomon Grundy. The player said that Hulk was going to rip off part of the building's roof and hurl it down at his enemy. I told him that the papercraft building had a detachable roof, so for the sake of verisimilitude, he could remove it and place it near the Solomon Grundy miniature. The building looked like this:<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/over1.jpg"/><br/><br/>And when the player removed the top of the building, everyone then saw that out of all the buildings on this map, this was the one where I had elected to hide a miniature for an ambush. It was the Red Skull, who was clutching the Cosmic Cube (a very powerful weapon), and he was going to use it to summon a bunch of demons from hell.<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/over2.jpg"/><br/><br/>Quoth the Red Skull, who had a perfect line of sight on Captain America: "Und we meet again, Herr Rogers. This time, for the last time."<br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://www.rafaelchandler.com/over3.jpg"/><br/><br/>And the players all screamed that this was, indeed, epic.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378206">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378206/#Comment_378206" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T08:42:53+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  8:42AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I'd resume it to "GM &amp; players make the unexpected happen". From the players side it starts with an out-of-the-box plan or a desperate move that either by sheer luck or good judgement ends up working against the odds and sends all the plot into a different, unexpected direction. From the GM side it can be an inspired unexpected scene either prepared and masterfully railroaded or improvised from the choices players have taken in the session. Also a particularly inspired character interpretation from a player or the GM or better yet, a dialogue between them can also make for epic moments.<br/><br/>For example, I still remember that session when our three 1st level characters killed a CR5 troll by tracking it to its lair, sneaking upon him when he was asleep and beheading it. The GM wasn't expecting it at all and we all were amazed that it actually worked, since we made it by sheer luck. The GM consulted his friends and finally gave us the XP at the next session. After that in another session, we disabled an explosive trap in a dungeon (one designed to completely destroy the place) and transported a couple of barrels of alchemist fire to blow a pass in the mountains and block the advance of an orc army. Again, we barely made it and the GM only allowed it to see how far we get, since it wasn't supposed to happen at all.<br/><br/>Also,<a href="http://1d4chan.org/wiki/Sameo" rel="nofollow">this.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378222">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378222/#Comment_378222" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T09:51:31+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  9:51AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jason Morningstar</cite>Is it possible to generate satisfying Epic in a one-shot?

This campaign had started off as very low-key but got sorta epic pretty quickly in a prophecy kind of way. That didn't really feel very epic. the stakes were high, but we didn't know and feel it during the conflict. In the end, all vampires in the world except for a handful perished, which should have felt epic, but it didn't really. Then, the campaign started to get low-key again and built up to a truly epic finale. This was different. All the players were cooperating to make it happen. I think what really made this epic was the buildup. It was really only a single session of buildup, but we interspersed our regular scenes with Signs of What Was Coming. Little scenes of what the bad guy was doing (unearthing the seal that would unite the five vampiric souls and free the Devil himself). We'd have scenes with characters trying to warn everyone and rally the forces who were in the middle of a bloody struggle for dominance (instigated by the big bad guy). Even the scenes which didn't really have much to do with the big climax, the scenes that were just tying up loose ends from the rest of the campaign, acquired a whole new meaning because we knew what was about to happen. A PC even died in one of those scenes, further securing in the mind of everyone that This Was It. And then we let loose the apocalyptic imagery. Clouds of fire and sulphur. Darkened skies. Armies of hell hounds. Winged building-sized daemon.<br/><br/>And we all felt this was what we had been building up to. This was what we had seen coming. This was the big finale. This was where it all came to an end, one way or another. And we all cooperated to make that happen. The fight was very epic in many ways. The arcs of the characters came to their points. My character finally stood for free, fighting for nobody but himself. Kim's character had to fight off the evil influence that was taking over his mind. Either he did it now, or he would forever be a slave to it. Daniel's character finally found the greater truth she had been looking for, although it was a much darker truth than she had expected. She turned and united with the Devil. And Erik's character was finally free from the organization that had been controlling him. He was finally the hero that he had dreamt of being when he signed up. And he was facing the biggest villain there was.<br/><br/>I think this was the combination that made it <i>feel</i> epic to us: the coming together of the characters' story arcs, the knowledge in the play group that this was the end, and the buildup during the session, constantly reminding us that the end was near.<br/><br/>Epic imagery isn't hard to do. Hell's armies, fate of galaxies, fulfilled prophesies and all that. Easy peasy pizza cheesy. But in order for it to <i>feel</i> epic, you need buildup. Lots of buildup and foreshadowing, and then the knowledge in the group that this is it. This is what it all comes down to. Everything hinges on this one battle. This sort of buildup is probably easier to do in a campaign, but I think you can do it in a one-shot. It's more difficult, but with characters the players care deeply about, issues that develop together (separate issues take more time to develop), aggressive scene framing and clever foreshadowing, you could probably do it. It'll be harder, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378252">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378252/#Comment_378252" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T12:23:14+00:00" title="May 14, 2012 12:23PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2012 12:23PM by JDCorley.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Epic is super-amazing for comedy, because all you have to do is have one mundane character say one mundane thing and it's a laff riot.

I designed a <a href="http://www.danmaruschak.com/blog/final-hour-of-a-storied-age/" rel="nofollow">a game</a> that's supposed to capture the Epic Fantasy literary genre (e.g. <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>), but I think when most gamers hear the words "epic fantasy" they mentally translate it to "D&amp;D at level 20+". For me, the epic in Epic Fantasy is about connecting a story about individual decisions and personal virtue to a worldwide scope as way of underscoring the point that those things matter.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378267">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Teataine" title="Teataine"><img alt="Teataine" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://img693.imageshack.us/img693/748/teacupicon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Teataine">Teataine</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378267/#Comment_378267" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T13:42:44+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  1:42PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think what this thread is lacking is a clarification of what we mean by "epic".

The epic is vast in scope, it's not "accessible", it's larger than what we can immediately perceive. It transcends the measurable in some way. The army extends beyond our sight. The story spans beyond our lifetime. The hero's strength or courage is beyond what we could muster.<br/><br/>This makes it "larger than life", larger than our individual experiences. In this it is awe-inspiring (both awesome and inspiring) and it transports us to some other place, some other time, removes us from the here and now, abducts us from the present and takes us into the fiction.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378269">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378269/#Comment_378269" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T13:54:24+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  1:54PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2012 1:58PM by DeBracy.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [In this post epic = over the top kickass awesomesauce]<br/><br/>In the first version of my sword &amp; sorcery game each session usually started off kind of sensible but almost always things would ramp up to whole different scale. In the second playtest the Nameless woman (whose name had been stolen by the soul eating demon Sitaxis) and Durbak, a warrior shaman from the northern wolftribes, stole back the sun from the gods. WTF?<br/><br/>Another time a lowly thief namned something like Janne Padda ("Joe Toad" might be decent English equvalent) went on to become an avatar of the Night Goddess in the final act. Of course he unlocked (unleashed?) his true form by stabbing his dagger might of darkness into his forehead. WTF?<br/><br/>In those day the game had very little boundries as to what a successful roll ment. Your task as player (or GM) was just to discribe how things got better or worse depending on the roll. I had a visible pacing mechanism as well, where I'd put a number of glass beads forward to represent the dangers at hand. A successful roll removed one bead.<br/><br/>In those days the game was supposed to be played in five chapters. In the first chapter the GM had two beads, and each subsequent chapter another two beads would be added (2,4, 6, 8, 10).<br/><br/>Things I think contributed to the ramp up in epicness:<br/>\u2022 Instead of repeating themselves people'd start describing more and more crazy actions, giving magic items new abilites, etc.<br/>\u2022 The act structure suggested some sort of curve up to a climax<br/>\u2022 Narrating in third person was encouraged, first person dialogue was kept to a minimum. The game was explicitly about doing cool stuff.<br/>\u2022 Before you rolled you said what stuff you were using ("I'm using Might, Undefeated champion of the Emerald Queen, my Harp of the Ancients, and my enchanted sword") based on some vague idea of what your character was going to do, and then you'd just have to get all the stuff in your description.<br/>\u2022 In 2007 few of the people I played with had ever played a game where they not only could but SHOULD narrated how fucking cool they were everytime they did something.<br/><br/>Sometimes, as in the examples above, it got crazy epic and was cool. Other times everyone'd get creative fatigue around act four or we'd have an early climax and call it quits since we realized we just could top what just happened.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378273">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378273/#Comment_378273" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T14:35:55+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  2:35PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Those of you engaging with the topic, thanks!

There were many great battles and momentous events (murders, resurrections, betrayals), but in the final session, the following went down:<br/><br/>1. The Templar discovered that a masked NPC was actually his long-sought archenemy. When the mask came off, and the identity was revealed, there was much astonishment. Two years of searching, and the villain was under their noses the whole time.<br/><br/>2. The Sorcerer sided with the Templar's enemy. Their goals were the same, as were their methods. Furious with this betrayal, the Drow Templar swore eternal hatred.<br/><br/>3. The Warrior decided that, rather than rescue an innocent from demons, he would resolve the problem by letting the demons drag the innocent to Hell, then seal the portal between worlds, preventing any further harm. The innocent was also the son of a powerful ruler -- one who had hired them to protect his Realm (which, they pointed out, they had).<br/><br/>4. The Necromancer shattered a dangerous artifact, but in doing so, she inadvertently erased the Warrior from reality -- the Warrior didn't just vanish, but all memory and record of his existence was gone as well.<br/><br/>5. A bunch of other brutal stuff happened. <br/><br/>The group dubbed this an epic bloodletting, as there was no returning from it. Two of the five heroes hated each other, and another one was gone forever, as though he'd never been born.<br/><br/>We really couldn't figure out a way to continue playing, in no small part because of the emotional intensity of the events. Sure, we could have come up with a new character, or found a way for the Templar and Sorcerer to reconcile. But topping that frenzy of carnage and double-crosses? No way. It was too... epic. Too emotional, too wide-screen (thousands died, an empire burned, a war was lost), too perfect a resolution to a two-year quest for heroism (which, needless to say, was not achieved).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378283">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ivan" title="ivan"><img alt="ivan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/422/nEF5B02SA80RX.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ivan">ivan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378283/#Comment_378283" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T15:17:09+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  3:17PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I had several epic moments in the same session while playing Becoming Heroes and although the GM had the right kind of epic rhetoric I feel that mechanics were very relevant. <br/><br/>The system to solve conflicts is deceitfully simple: you add in traits, and for every trait you get a die to roll.. except that you don't declare all traits at the same time and this makes a huge difference.<br/><br/>You will start out with the most obvious traits (I use my 'sword' trait, my 'knight' trait etc..) but if your antagonist has roughly the same number of traits you are soon forced to work out creative uses to justify your skills and you keep swinging between desperation and awesomeness as dice are matched by your antagonist.<br/><br/>For example, an attempt at infiltrating an enemy starship systems ended up with my character taking combat drugs and going on the outside hull of the ship under battle fire so that he could access the manual override controls.. and that was all to justify playing a "neural boosters" and "war hero" traits.

Not every single game, but a pretty high hit rate. The combination of high world stakes plus high personal stakes (and no escape from either) seems to hit that spot. Also the stories are separated but big world consequences of each domino into the other stories (you overthrew the government in your last scene, so my next scene is in the middle of a riot).<br/><br/>You can definitely play "detached, 5000 foot view" Microscope games, but for a one-shot I find they're a lot more epic and engaging if you follow this recipe:<br/><br/>- straight-forward history concept (it's about the characters and what happens, not a bizarre setting)<br/>- tight Focuses, like a specific person or event<br/>- play lots of scenes &amp; ask personal incriminating questions about the characters (why did Corporal Barnes abandon his friend in enemy territory?)<br/><br/>Same as with Polaris &amp; Shock: you've already got the big world drama, now you're seeing how the personal drama meshes into it. That's the epic recipe to me. q.v. <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/382/once-and-future-zombie/" rel="nofollow">Once and Future Zombie</a> and <a href="http://www.lamemage.com/blog/index.php/115/dinosaur-hruck/" rel="nofollow">Dinosaur Hruck</a>.

Like, we played a Shadowrun game back in the day that started off all light and fun and street-level but eventually ended up with helicopters crashing into megacorp headquarters while the Decker led a team of l337 h4x0rz into the mainframe to free the captured AI while the Shaman did battle with some incredibly powerful guardian spirit, etc etc etc details that don't matter.  What counts was that it was what the whole campaign was leading up to - that we had played the same characters from street-hood nobodies with discount gear up to the massive earth-shaking badasses we'd become.  We'd worked for that shit and now it was time to use it.<br/><br/>Little things like music can really help, too - building themes into the game with a soundtrack that leads up to that final moment.  I mean, it's a cheap trick, but it's damn useful.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378315">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378315/#Comment_378315" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T18:15:36+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  6:15PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2012 6:16PM by zircher.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            If I need to bring epic to the table, I'd use the Wushu Open rules.

As the fighting tournament on the isle unfolded, families fractured, battles ensued over volcanic fields, and capes fluttered.  The most epic moment \u2013 the big emotional payoff \u2013 was actually at the end, when only the hapless Gin Seng Tea remained alive, having otherwise watched literally<i>every</i>death in the game happen before his character's eyes. Emotionally battered after his victory over the easily vanquished tournament master, he then fell to his knees and wept on the iconic temple precipice for his fallen comrades and enemies.<br/><br/>What's the appeal? A convergence of affective threads that, while overdetermined, still has some unexpected element within it. A seed of something both human and eternal contained.<br/><br/>How did we make it happen? Having a group of players all on the same page about the melodrama, but also circumstantial choices made (i.e., including Gin Seng Tea in every scene anyone died)</blockquote>\nNot coincidentally, EPIC is your shattered cyborg solider walking into the heart of a volcano with the body of his slain beloved, recently killed by the would-be heir to her criminal empire, who proved to be their son, whom he subsequently had beaten to death with his broken mechanical arm in grief.<br/><br/>I have found my most 'epic' play experiences to have come out of those sorts of situations, where you set up something where you're attached to the feel and atmosphere you're aiming for, but not (and I think this is critically important, in my experience) to the PCs themselves. It really helps that games like Mist Robed Gate have mechanical cues to encourage a particular sort of narrative, one that pushes the players towards poetic language and overt expression of their internal narratives. <br/><br/>Every time I've been in a long-term game that actively tried for an EPIC climax or, like, super-encounter, it's fallen somehow flat, typically because the GM was too intent on managing the outcome, and the players were too invested in the fate of their beloved PCs. We have had some 'EPIC' adventures, but they've generally been just because everything clicked that night, or what I thought was just a clever encounter turned out to be just what everyone was looking for that game. It sure helps to have trust, but not so much that the players lay back and expect the GM to do all the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>(In addition to<i> Mist-Robed Gate</i>, the couple games of <i>Swords Without Master</i> I have played really push the game this way...)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378326">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378326/#Comment_378326" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-14T20:21:08+00:00" title="May 14, 2012  8:21PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 14, 2012 8:30PM by David_Berg.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think I say, "Dude, that was epic!" in my gaming to celebrate when the game situation makes a big, powerful action* uniquely possible or uniquely effective.<br/><br/>If you have a "smash planets" power that you can use at will, there's nothing epic about that.  <br/><br/>If you have a "smash things" power, and you luck or win your way into the Citadel of "planets count as things now", and you smash a planet, <i>then</i> that's epic.<br/><br/>Also, rolling 100 on some percentile table that has mostly moderate results but one crazy one is "epic".<br/><br/>*I think "big, powerful" is actually more about the color of the action's <i>outcome</i> than its <i>attempt</i>.  <i>Trying</i> to smash a planet is <i>not</i> epic.  Pressing a button and narrating how the world goes through various dramatic phases of upheaval and destruction <i>is</i> epic.<br/><br/>So what's the appeal?  Synergy, a special moment in play, the happily unexpected, bombastic narration, vivid visualization, power-tripping, often with a side of comedic exaggeration.  Feeling awesome for a gameplay choice while your character feels awesome for its execution and you both feel awesome about the fictional outcome.  I guess that's kind of a generic answer, but I don't see moments of Epic as being that different from other celebrated moments of play.<br/><br/>As for one-shots: My experience is that I do have epic moments in one shots, but very rarely.  Any game which made the odds of a certain outcome likely in a single session probably wouldn't give me an "epic" feeling when that outcome occurred.  A one-shot game that promises "epic" play every time would probably fail for me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378355">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378355/#Comment_378355" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T02:46:07+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  2:46AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>the couple games of<i>Swords Without Master</i>I have played really push the game this way...</blockquote>\nFor me too, Jim.<br/><br/><i>Swords without Master</i> creates an environment where every action your character takes is already the stuff of legend, and not in a sense like <i>In a Wicked Age</i> where you've got gods and mortals running around doing f***ed up things to each other \u2013 I'm talking about vulnerably human individuals taking individual leaps into the unknown, where neither the Overplayer (GM) nor the rest of the players know if they're going to succeed or not, but it'll be inscribed in print somewhere all the same...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378359">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus" title="Dionysus"><img alt="Dionysus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/694/n0ANCVBURZLRD.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dionysus">Dionysus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378359/#Comment_378359" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T03:05:46+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  3:05AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            We really need a page which links to all the places you can buy these games...<br/>Swords without Master looks interesting                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378363">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner" title="Evan_Torner"><img alt="Evan_Torner" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/278/nHOYP3VNJB6A6.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Evan_Torner">Evan_Torner</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378363/#Comment_378363" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-15T03:35:16+00:00" title="May 15, 2012  3:35AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2012 5:59AM by Evan_Torner.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You can buy a lot of them <a href="http://www.theunstore.com" rel="nofollow">here.</a><br/><br/><a href="https://dig1000holes.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/for-my-ravening-wolves-part-i/" rel="nofollow">Swords without Master</a> is a pulp fantasy game that Epidiah Ravachol (<i>Dread</i>, <i>Time &amp; Temp</i>) has been developing since 2009.<br/><br/>Many of us have played it at various folk's houses and conventions, but it likely won't see print until 2013.<br/><br/>Your best bet is to follow Eppy around and get him to run it for you.

I think it's actually one of the benefits of Story Before, that you can craft an apropriate build-up and a truly epic finale without struggling about it during the game itself. There is something liberating about trusting yourself to the GM, who is in full control, and focussing on contributing your part to the fiction, really enjoying the experience instead of negotiating its exact shape (plus, consistancy is usually better). Some of the most epic scenes included:<br/>\n<br/>\n- While the great car race in post-apocalyptic Salt Lake City is nearing the final lap, the bomb in the transmission tower is ticking and is bound to spill "the Plague" on all the spectators and turn them into mutants, but then an explosion shakes the foundation of the tower and it falls, the large conrete sphere at the top breaking apart to reveal wires and biohazard container, as it hits the surface of the toxic swamp the Salt Lake has become in the post-apocalypse, and is sucked down while our heroes ride the race track ahead of the chasing villains to make their escape.<br/>\n<br/>\n- Our heroes, who have travelled back in time to stop the Sith's evil masterplan to assassinate Luke Skywalker as a little boy, side by side with Obi-Wan Kenobi, face off against three powerful Sith warriors in the streets of Mos Eisley.<br/>\n<br/>\n- The demons and their human allies are attacking the city of Mendena from land and sea, our heroes have just caught a glance of the dark lord Borbarad (the canonical uber-villain) returned to life, a gargantuan demon ark is besieging the port and the forces of good are fighting a losing battle. But then the blood of a fallen priest touches the holy quartz of Angrosch, the God of crafts, which the heroes have just recovered from an evil witch by shooting her flying demon steed down from the sky with a whaler harpoon, and the quartz transforms into a sacred battle axe, and our heroes hack their way against impossible odds straight into the heart of the demon ark and kill its pilot (disgustingly ingrown with the ark itself and therefore irreplacable), then make their escape from the sinking monstrosity while the city is burning.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_378600">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T" title="Frank T"><img alt="Frank T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Frank%20T">Frank T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378600/#Comment_378600" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T02:19:58+00:00" title="May 16, 2012  2:19AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 16, 2012 2:20AM by Frank T.">edited May 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dan Maruschak</cite>For a lot of people, it means crazy, over-the-top, riding-laser-sharks-to-storm-the-gates-of-valhalla zaniness.</blockquote>\nI thought that was what "awesomeness" was referring to. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> But yeah, it's the WuShu fallacy, I'm not really a fan either.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378635">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378635/#Comment_378635" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T09:08:09+00:00" title="May 16, 2012  9:08AM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Once playing Anima, our PCs found a tavern at night beside the road.

We have been playing Dungeon World whilst camping (as a replacement to the ubiquitous UNO) for the last year, and since we only go camping every couple of months, the anticipation has been getting more and more delicious. The characters are at 'name' level now, having been through almost every iteration of the ruleset and now got down to the nitty gritty of Kingdom Crushing. <br><br/>I play fast and loose as GM, my fronts are nebulous affairs, adapting to the player's decisions in an almost Burning Wheel, belief-driven, antagonistic way. Bonds are increasingly important in our DW game and I encourage the players to write strong, action achievable bonds with each other, NPCs, locations, items and monsters. Tonks and Brancino have reset their bond with each other twice, and now sit at -3 apiece as they are at loggerheads over an important story generated goal of a Dragonling clutch and its human 'Mother'. Brancino is head of the Thieves guild in Dingledale, and thus the puller of strings on the puppet prince Jeremy the 'Just'. Tonks is head of the wizardly Order of the Phoenix, after deposing the Warlock of firetop mountain and installing himself in the Dragon Ruined Caverns under the hill.<br/><br/>The problem is that these events have instigated the return of dragonkind from beyond the Dragon's Maw (a la GoT Targaryen / Skyrim mountain region hybrid) and the players have authored themselves into a pickle, both wanting control of the dragons for their own designs on power that I just have to prod and pole occasionly to illicit super-fun gaming.<br/><br/>Sooooo, we wandered down to the small pebble strewn beach, 'built' the land with Sandcastles for towns and fortifications and seaweed forests, scree mountains and pebbly wastes and ruins and the ever encroaching sea. My nephew's bucket of Schliech minis represented armies and figures of note, in a sort of grand campaign map come relations map, and as the players made 'kingdom' moves (based on the gang-level conflict of AW). Dice were rolled on our tin plates, Inspirational Minis were pulled out of the bucket and instantly were authored into the story, spies went on surreptitious missions, merchants wrangled vast treasuries, Diplomats secured uneasy alliances. Armies were forged, great magics wrought and towns laid waste by Dragon Fire. Marc and Chris had gleeful moments where they could literally 'stomp' their opponents castles into oblivion and 'deforest' vast tracts of seaweed to manufacture their armada of ships. <br/><br/>A generation passed, a new Draconic order was instigated and both characters survived their adventuring and cantankerous bickering into old age and an uneasy alliance of Wizardly Ruler and Artful wife, advised by their shifty-looking halfling 'hand'. The next time we play will be afresh with new characters! The ocean and rain that night swept away all evidence of our epic storytelling, except the memory of it in our imaginations as <i>'Dude! That was Epic!'</i> </br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_378728">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred" title="watergoesred"><img alt="watergoesred" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6681148/Account%20icon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/watergoesred">watergoesred</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/378728/#Comment_378728" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-05-16T22:24:00+00:00" title="May 16, 2012 10:24PM">May 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow, Noofy!
