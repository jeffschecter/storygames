It was the first game to really get me excited about playing a kind of RPG that was different from D&amp;D. It was my gateway drug, in some respects, to other games I really like.<br/><br/>Yet I have never played a really awesome Burning Wheel game. I've played through some one-shots, and I've been in two BW campaigns. I've enjoyed it, but never as much as I wanted to, or as much as it seemed like I could.<br/><br/>Two friends of mine, James and John, both of whom I play with in a larger gaming group (currently playing Deadlands with Savage Worlds), are sort of in the same mindset, so we decided to start a new BW campaign and MAKE IT WORK RIGHT DAMMIT. <br/><br/>For our first session, we spent so much time discussing the what and how behind what we want out of the game, and what we did all wrong in our last BW campaign, and then so much time inventing the world we want to set this game in, we didn't have time to do any playing.<br/><br/>We did create two character concepts, as a group, and then James and John each chose one to actually burn and play. Which was pretty cool.<br/><br/>Some stuff we agreed on:\n<ul>\n<li>The campaign will be short-form, three to four sessions.<br/></li><li>Brian (me) will GM, but if we enjoy the game enough to continue, we'll rotate the GM's role.<br/></li><li>We want to fully grok the Burning Wheel ruleset, so we'll try to a) bring game elements in slowly (Fight!, Duel of Wits, magic systems, etc) as we comprehend them in play. We will also try to stick pretty closely to the Rules-As-Written, by hewing to the default gritty, classic fantasy setting of the game, and not throwing out rules systems in favor of simpler ones (like the skill advancement rules from Mouse Guard).<br/></li><li>The game will be set in a single, ancient, fantastic city. The main element of the setting will be the New City, a clean and well-maintained military fortress built over the ruins of an ancient dwarven hold; and the Undercity, an endless, lightless warren of levels and streets and crypts that extends far down into the earth.<br/></li><li>The characters are searching for a mysterious group of violent insurrectionists in the Undercity.</li>\n</ul>\nThis is probably a really dull AP, but it was such an unusual game session that I thought it might be worth posting. James' wife was perplexed that our game did not involve any game.<br/><br/>Mostly I am determined to play the game of Burning Wheel that I hear other people talking about, but have never experienced.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_192541">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge" title="EarthenForge"><img alt="EarthenForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/EarthenForge">EarthenForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192541/#Comment_192541" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-13T22:30:01+00:00" title="February 13, 2009 10:30PM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like you're off to a good start! Did you guys do just the character concepts or have you gotten to the actual burning? Also, did you all come up with specific ideas for the antagonists as well? When deciding on Beliefs together, it's a lot of fun to riff off of each other - both between players; and between players and the GM. Creating these layers of conflict and unity can really make the game sing.<br/><br/>There are times when my long-term game is less than awesome and it rarely has to do with absolute understanding of the game (although lack of understanding can certainly contribute to frustration!). No, for us it's usually about Beliefs. If one or more of these situations occurs, the game flounders and the passion fades:<br/><br/>1. I (the GM) get too caught up in the fiction and don't give pressing their Beliefs and Instincts enough thought.<br/>2. A player has a Belief/Instinct that he/she really doesn't care about or find interesting in play.<br/>3. A player has a Belief that isn't working with the fiction right now and he/she is unwilling to put it on the backburner, so it just hangs there like a dead limb, taking up space, not earning Artha or adding to the story in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>In our last session, one of the PCs who's young in her Faith was trying to get the help of the High Priestess for a difficult prayer. From a previous Duel of Wits, the Priestess had already earned the PCs loyalty as a acolyte. I was stumped for a minute trying to figure out how to press her buttons in the Statement - what more could the Priestess want? Then I realized I was focusing too much on the antagonist as a character instead of *being* the antagonist myself. I took a quick look at the PCs Beliefs again. One involved wanting to make a good friend of hers the colony's new governor. That friend is a passionate atheist. Click! In her DoW Statement, the Priestess wanted the PC to ensure that only a person of faith leads the colony. The player's eyes blazed at this and I knew I had hit her Belief right on the mark. The DoW went from ho-hum to ROCK in an instant. (The Priestess lost the DoW, btw, but with a major compromise - the PC will now try to convert her friend - let teh awesome rain!)   <br/><br/>All that to say, I can't emphasize enough the importance of Beliefs to a passionate game. As a player, make ones that interest *you* and then embrace them. Choose to care about them! And gun for them every chance you get. As a GM, intertwine your antagonists in their Beliefs and hit those Beliefs (and Traits and Instincts) often and hard. But your arsenal doesn't end there. Check out their Relationships, Possessions, and Reputations/Affiliations. Those are all things that you can get your fingers into and mess with. If you can get them to care and fight back, then you've just "won" Burning Wheel. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Lots of luck to you, Brian!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_192560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain" title="coffeestain"><img alt="coffeestain" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/coffeestain">coffeestain</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/192560/#Comment_192560" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-02-14T07:44:23+00:00" title="February 14, 2009  7:44AM">February 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Wow.<br/><br/>The Burning Games have been my white whale forever.

It occurred to me that when we "play" an RPG we are sitting around making stuff up.  And when, to prepare for a game, we sit around making stuff up in terms of world or characters, we are making stuff up.<br/><br/>In short, some switch got flipped, and it <i>all</i> became play.  My playing has been better for it.  I'm willing to take the time, as a player or GM, to indulge in sitting around making stuff up with my fellow players without any sense of disappointment or impatience.  This made the prep session more fun, and it paid off in spades because some games (not all), really benefit from having a real sit down and brainstorm session. <i>In a Wicked Age</i>, <i>Primetime Adventures </i>and others clearly should not have a prep session ahead of time.  <i>Sorcerer, Burning Wheel, HeroQuest</i> in Glorantha are, in my view, all games that require them.<br/><br/>But the key is, for me, it's all play.<br/><br/>I would really make sure to invest as much shared character creation time as you can.

It *is* all play ... sitting around James' basement discussing imaginary characters is fundamentally the same activity as sitting around James' basement rolling dice to see if the imaginary characters can sneak aboard the ship. Either way, I'm not at work, or watching TV.<br/><br/>But the part of play we are anxious to get to is the second, more gamelike part. I share your enthusiasm for a first session that is centered around character and setting creation.

But we are back on this week.<br/><br/>Prior to that, we played our second session. It turned out to be mostly expository information.  The two characters were reunited .. the younger one had been imprisoned as a youth, and raised by the overlord/conqueror race (think Saxons and Celts, or whatever fits). The city is under the grip of a terrorist/insurrectionist campaign by a mysterious entity or group (the Black Hand), and Umit / John's guy has returned to the Undercity of his birth to mine his old street connections to find the bad guys. Surhan / James' guy is all grizzled and cynical, but has agreed to help his long-lost nephew. The backdrop is a city almost in the grip of civil war.<br/><br/>The two characters' beliefs were a little fuzzy going into things, but the players have firmed them up. We consulted the internets, where there is a lot of good advice about writing beliefs.<br/><br/>Per Judd's suggestion earlier, below are the final beliefs for the two characters. Any advice on these, or good ways to bring the awesome based on them, would be appreciated.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/><b>Umit Theobald</b> (John's guy): A native of the Undercity, raised by the military conquerors who dwell in the New City. Has gone AWOL to return to the mean streets of his birth and capture the Black Hand [main bad guy].<br/><br/><b>Beliefs:</b><br/>-- The Witches' Council can't be allowed to use this act of terror to justify a pogrom.  I'll return to the overcity with the Black Hand... or his head.   <br/>-- Surhan [the other PC] can't see the big picture.  I will show him that we're up against a greater evil than he knows.   <br/>-- The Saxons nee our help to defeat the evil Watu [a neighboring empire], but they must respect us.  I'll prove my worth, and, thus, my people's. <br/><br/>This character has a good range of skills, including combat and social skills, but nothing extraordinary.<br/><br/><b>Surhan Tahir</b> (James' guy): Bookseller and aging lieutant in a large smugglers gang. Resents his place in the larger gang hierarchy and wants his shot at the big time.<br/><br/><b>Beliefs:</b><br/>-- Birol [head of the gang] and probably his son have threatened The Family by allying themselves with The Black Hand [the main villain of the campaign]. To save The Family I must overthrow Birol the Suk. <br/>-- Once I'm in charge of The Family I will need a loyal lieutenant familiar with the Saxons.  I will begin testing and grooming Umit [the other PC].<br/>-- The Big Face Gang is my only family and the most important thing in my life.

They are bidding their time and will reclaim The Undercity when the time is right.<br/><br/>This character is pretty well-rounded in terms of skills and resources, and has an important and unfriendly relationship with the son of the current gang boss.

It went pretty well. The two characters did some investigating-type stuff, and, for the most part we managed to run it by the rules, rather than "just" role-play it. One of the players (James) did an opposed persuasion test to convince an NPC to set up a meeting with a crime lord, and later he did a Circles test to find out where a stash of dwarven hooch was. The other player (John) took a back seat somewhat, but he rolled helping dice, and they both used FoRKs well.<br/><br/>One thing we're trying to do that seems to be in the spirit of BW (and story games in general) is using rules ONLY when it counts, and making sure that it DOES count. So I'm trying to be better about explicitly setting stakes. The characters were trying to get across town for the big meeting without attracting the attention of the city watch, so I made it clear what would happen if they suceeded and what would happen if they failed. On another test, John decided to forego rolling altogether, since we couldn't decide what failure would look like aside from "game-ruining". <br/><br/>A few comments / questions:<br/><br/>-- In a test against an NPC with which a PC has a relationship, should he get bonus dice?<br/><br/>-- Giving out mandatory Workhorse and MVP artha awards seems forced in a game with only two players. But that leads to less artha overall, and they blew through most of their starting artha in last night's game. Should we just give each character a persona point at the end of each session? (In addition to other, earned rewards, that is).<br/><br/>-- Some APs and posts I've read suggest that there is a lot of dice-rolling and testing in most BW games, but we don't have so much of that in this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_198890">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/198890/#Comment_198890" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-26T09:42:02+00:00" title="March 26, 2009  9:42AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite><br/><br/>A few comments / questions:<br/><br/>1) In a test against an NPC with which a PC has a relationship, should he get bonus dice?<br/><br/>2) Giving out mandatory Workhorse and MVP artha awards seems forced in a game with only two players.

Keep in mind, artha doesn't come from on high but from the group.  Read what the Workhorse and the MVP mean and talk it over with your buddies.

I change atleast two beliefs each session. normally it is because I fulfilled one of my goals. sometimes that goal is stymied, so I change it and move on. many other players don't like this type of play.

To save The Family I must overthrow Birol the Suk. <br/>-- Once I'm in charge of The Family I will need a loyal lieutenant familiar with the Saxons. I will begin testing and grooming Umit [the other PC].<br/><br/>Most of the session involved a meeting with Birol the Suk (and planning for it). At the meeting, he planted false information that we all agreed will blow up in his face in the next session. So that went okay.<br/><br/>He also "tested" Umit (the other PC) on two occasions, but both times it fell flat, mostly because Umit didn't realize he was being tested. Maybe he should have been explicit ("Hey, John, my guy is gonna test your guy here to see what he does...")<br/><br/>The character's belief about the dwarves is actually a fourth belief, thrown in mostly for color. James wanted his character to have a quirk ( a delusional belief that the dwarves will return), so he added an extra belief and instinct. they don't realy generate artha, so that's why they're "extra".<br/><br/>Umit (the other PC) didn't really do anything to act on any of his beliefs. I guess that is an indication that they are too broad, or that the game situations are not meeting them.<br/><br/>John (Umit's player) actually emailed us this morning to say that he felt like his play was disappointing, and he'll try to be more dynamic in the next game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_199123">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/199123/#Comment_199123" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-03-27T11:32:23+00:00" title="March 27, 2009 11:32AM">March 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: khelek</cite>What i have found was never helpful was telling they were doing it wrong.</blockquote>\nIt's not like that ..

Even gun-ho players don't like it. I am not saying you are doing that, but i have seen it happen when the forums come at you a 1,000 miles an hour and your trying to jack your games up a notch.

Tonight's session was fun, and using the rules is coming more naturally to us. As you get more used to forcing yourself to "go to the dice" you grok the mechanics more.<br/><br/>We did all observe that tonight's game felt very D&amp;D-ish, which puzzles me a little. John still hasn't found much grounding for his character yet (a conflicted ex-soldier torn between two cultures), so James' character (a manipulative and somewhat ruthless gangster) ends up driving much of the action. <br/><br/>James' character ended up coming up with a number of somewhat hare-brained schemes involving lying to the crimelord and trying to get his hands on some dwarven nog. That had a D&amp;D/Savage Worlds quality to it, in which the intended gritty/heroic feel is replaced by something more cartoonish.<br/><br/>We also ran a couple of combat encounters between the PCs and an old lady smuggler and her thuggish son. They came up in a circles test as people who had some nog, but they developed into the primary antagonists of the session. (Which was great, since it's nice to have random NPCs become central to the story, even as comic relief).<br/><br/>Still somewhat spooked by the complexity of Fight!, we are using bloody versus tests. Combat using those rules also has a D&amp;D-like quality to it, with the "one round" back-and-forth between combatants, and general resistance to injury (although that later part may just be the low combat skills of the PCs and the people they were fighting). It definitely flows differently than the full-on combat rules.<br/><br/>What I'm thinking through now is whether this is anything meaningful in my ongoing quest to "get" Burning Wheel, or whether it was just one game. Tonight's game *was* fun, but it was fun in the same way that a good night of, say, 3rd edition D&amp;D with a good group is fun.<br/><br/>Most of the Burning Wheel advice one gets is (rightly) focused on beliefs in play, and I can tell that we are still not really using that interface to bring the awesome.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202233">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/noclue" title="noclue"><img alt="noclue" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://stop-gambling.com/images/question_dice.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/noclue">noclue</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202233/#Comment_202233" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T23:50:51+00:00" title="April 15, 2009 11:50PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite>...all observe that tonight's game felt very D&amp;D-ish, which puzzles me a little.</blockquote> Why puzzled?

If you want suggestions on how to do that in your game, I'm sure folks here could come up with interesting ideas based on the beliefs you've sketched out above.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202234">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202234/#Comment_202234" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-15T23:55:30+00:00" title="April 15, 2009 11:55PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited April 16, 2009 12:00AM by Judd.">edited April 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<cite>Posted By: noclue</cite><blockquote><cite>Posted By: BWA</cite> If you want suggestions on how to do that in your game, I'm sure folks here could come up with interesting ideas based on the beliefs you've sketched out above.</blockquote>\nYes.<br/><br/>Having a thread for help on Burning Wheel on the Story Games forum is a bit like taking a bicycle into the ocean but yeah, there are folks here who will gladly help, myself included if bringing those beliefs to the forefront is what you want.<br/><br/>What kind of artha is being handed out and for what?<br/><br/>Can you name a scene that you have framed that addresses the beliefs above?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202268">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202268/#Comment_202268" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T09:48:03+00:00" title="April 16, 2009  9:48AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, I guess I really should post at the BW forums, which I have done in the past.

I have another fat point to Surhan (James' character) for playing his belief of "testing and grooming" Umit (the other PC), since he managed to convince Umit to do a few things he didn't want to, and also kep a key piece of information from him for most of the session.<br/><br/>At the end of the game we decided on MVP and Workhorse awards ...

Most of the scenes revolved around the character's beliefs and the NPCs named in them, but my scene-framing could be more aggressive. I throw a fair amount of action at the PCs, in the form of "Suddenly, Murgo and Fat Mustapha are at the door, demanding you open up!", and that sort of thing, but since I can't answer more explicitly, I guess I need to do a better job directly engaging the PC's beliefs.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202270">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202270/#Comment_202270" name="Item_38" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T09:57:45+00:00" title="April 16, 2009  9:57AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brian,<br/><br/>Over how many sessions has it been with the sole artha flow as one fate for each player + the MVP and Workhorse?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202280">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202280/#Comment_202280" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T10:45:41+00:00" title="April 16, 2009 10:45AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            First session: Creation / discussion only<br/>Second session: "Exposition" scenes, more creation, no artha<br/>Third session: No artha awards!

Once play is done have every player go down their list of Beliefs and talk about things that they did to hit those beliefs during play. Also discuss what beliefs they didn't hit and make a note to your self to frame a scene next session that sets the missed belief up. Do the same for Instincts and Traits. <br/><br/>I switched over to this method recently for my Burning Wheel Thieves game and have found that first off this took a lot of the onus off of me as the GM to keep track of giving out Artha while we play and I can focus more on playing hard against the player's BITs instead. Also the end game review really provides the whole group with these nice summations of where each character and player is currently inregards to thief BITs. Also this has doubled the amount of Artha per session I am giving out.<br/><br/>- Colin                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202282">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202282/#Comment_202282" name="Item_41" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T11:36:49+00:00" title="April 16, 2009 11:36AM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That sounds like a great technique, Colin.

From what you posted just above, I'd say the artha flow is WAY too slow.<br/><br/>Some quick advice, from my (admittedly limited) play experience:<br/>* Have an Instinct that you will fairly often eschew, to create complications, for that Fate ping. (You award Fate for FOLLOWING an Instinct? Odd...)<br/>* Stay in character--USE those character Traits like sledgehammers, at times--and be sure to remind folks for the Fate pings ("Well, ya see, I'm so <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paranoid</span> that I...").<br/>* Never skip MVP/WH/Trait vote. Ever. Sometimes no one gets any--a fairly level and even (and maybe even slow or dull) session CAN happen. But then ask yourself why no one had a chance to be shine, or to save the day--did they even get tests? Is the story flow pushing against Beliefs, to force action (or make to make painful decisions)?<br/>* Remember that it takes 5(!)Deeds, and a bajillion Persona and Fate, to get ONE stinking epiphany. And realize that, very often, you can't focus artha expenditure into the one skill or attribute you really want or need to make the epiphany worthwhile. So that means you're looking at a LOT of accomplished goals, aided masses (or maybe just individuals), Trait and Instinct pings. At the rate you're going, you MIGHT epiphany in one aspect in, oh, ten years of play. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>* Be smart about how you approach test dot acquisition. Sucks to wipe off five Challenging when you finally get your two Difficult, to go from 5 to 6 (or whatever the precise math) in a skill.<br/><br/>Artha, as I see it, is supposed to be flying like fan mail. Someone should get at least a Fate, and ideally be forced to spend a F or P, in EVERY SCENE; or you're just wandering around the "real" story that your Beliefs are supposed to tell, or you've got Instincts that are irrelevant or uninteresting to you. I probably spend more time looking at my BITs section of my character sheet than at any other section--Stats, Attributes, Skills, Weapons, etc combined. Why? Because I'm ALWAYS asking myself how to drive them, how to ping them, how they can inform the story or complicate a situation.<br/><br/>And don't forget about those test dots! Look for Difficult and Challenging tests--if you're doing the above, then you should at least have the artha to give them a shot; and failure is FUN in a good BW game. Look for diversity, because you can't get more than one test dot award in a given scene (or maybe even less often, for some). One trick ponies advance VERY slowly, in general--the swordsman will rarely ever get better at Sword. But the swordsman who is also acrobatic (and using it) and is also a fast-talker (and using it) and is also observant (Assess) and is also willing to swap out to the knife once on the inside will surely be dot-rich, in but one session.<br/><br/>Anyway, sorry if I wandered off thread a bit, but the main thing I wanted to say was in the first paragraph of this post: be your characters, and that means be ALL of them: Traits, Instincts, Beliefs, and your suite of Skills. After that, it's just a matter of driving to a diversity of conflicts, to engage all of your attributes and so-forth.<br/><br/>HTH;<br/>David                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202287">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202287/#Comment_202287" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T12:13:57+00:00" title="April 16, 2009 12:13PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            My artha does not fly as fast and furious as David's does.

That's my guideline to let me know if I'm running the game right or not.<br/><br/>Techniques for handing out Artha:<br/><br/>* Mouseguard-ize Character Traits: We're doing this in our Jihad game right now and it works quite well. Basically you have these CTs without a lot of mechanical umph to them in BW RAW. So try this: Let players "invoke" them for an Advantage die (1 max, just like regular Advantage rules), or let them "invoke" them for a +1Ob <i>and </i>1 Fate. In either case, have them explain how the CT is helping/hindering their effort. If they take the +1Ob and they lose, use that to inform the consequences of that failure.<br/><br/>* Aim for Moldbreakers. This is pretty much my secret sauce for getting BW to run itself (along with handing over the detail reins via Wises). Look at each character's BITs and aim them at themselves. Extend that to aiming the characters' BITS at each other: you'll end up with hot DOWs <i>and</i> Fight!s <i>and</i> moldbreaker moments.<br/><br/>* Personally? I prefere real-time Artha for Fate generated by chasing Beliefs and for letting Instincts and Traits get in your way, as well as Personal for moldbreaker moments. I save right place right time, MVP and workhorse for post-game. I know real-time Artha is a point of contention, and it's not how BWHQ runs things, but right now I'm getting more juice from shortening up the economy than I am making folks recount/rationalize their Artha after the fact.<br/><br/>p.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202293">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202293/#Comment_202293" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T12:37:01+00:00" title="April 16, 2009 12:37PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Paul B</cite>My target is 2-3 Fate and 1-2 Persona per player per session.

All Luke's games (that I've seen so far: BW, BE, MG, and played: BW) are <i>deep</i> from a rules point of view. Learning the rules themselves may not be all that complex, but putting them in play effectively is <i>not</i> a simply learned task and one that takes time and patience.<br/><br/>My group played for a year on an almost weekly basis, and we ended up feeling that we didn't have a really good handle on how to put the rules into practice that worked for us.<br/><br/>With Luke's games, I think it probably makes sense to firmly separate in your group's collective expectations that "learning how to play the game" maps one-to-one onto  "the adventure we're about to play". These two things will almost certainly not be the same length of time, nor should they necessarily be, and if they did end up being the same length of time, I'd be very surprised.<br/><br/>Think of it like chess: you wouldn't expect to learn to really have fun with chess after your first game. Or second. Or third. And so on.<br/><br/>So -- the right length of <i>play</i> for a good arc to get you started is I think as Luke suggests: 6 to 8 sessions. Gives you a session or two to burn up characters, a session or two for rising action, a session or two for climactic actions, and a session to warm down and debrief.<br/><br/>But if that works for you, you'll want to try that again, adding in more rules. Then again, adding in more rules.<br/><br/>It will probably help you if you clearly set out a plan ahead of time for each "adventure" what rules are in play and which are not. Don't succumb to feature creep: if someone suggests "hey, let's just try out this Duel of Wits thing tonight", the best response is, "let's play the way we agreed, and then talk about it, and if we want to stick DoW into the next adventure, that's cool".<br/><br/>Luke cautions people again and again and again that they should learn the game in stages. And they don't listen. And they come away unhappy.<br/><br/>I have a feeling that partly this happens over and over again because people have a mental picture of the "campaign" as their one and only opportunity to learn to play the game in its entirety. Best if you don't think that way. Explicitly. Formally.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag" title="viktor_haag"><img alt="viktor_haag" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/591/nDZQG5TW1V86P.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/viktor_haag">viktor_haag</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202299/#Comment_202299" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T12:59:20+00:00" title="April 16, 2009 12:59PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: David Artman</cite><br/>* Stay in character--USE those character Traits like sledgehammers, at times--and be sure to remind folks for the Fate pings ("Well, ya see, I'm so<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Paranoid</span>that I...").</blockquote>\nSee, that's an awesome example of how different people and playstyles can groove with Luke's games. I have found from my play experience that the <i>best</i> moments we had with BW were when we payed no attention whatsoever to staying in character.<br/><br/>All the tactical, rules-heavy gritty moments were all "My character does that", and "ooh boy, you can get an extra die if I help you out this way", and etc, etc.<br/><br/>This really helped us keep the rules away from moments that were <i>fun</i> to roleplay, and clearly signalled the moments when it was time to "roll dice".<br/><br/>We're finding that this mode of play is serving us well as we're currently playing 4e. Very similar mode, very similar fun.<br/><br/>But whatever works for fun at your table.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202301">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy" title="DeBracy"><img alt="DeBracy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nTIWP6SSS5BV3.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeBracy">DeBracy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202301/#Comment_202301" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T13:09:37+00:00" title="April 16, 2009  1:09PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I know not a thing of Burning Wheel (oh alright I know the books are pretty and some of the terms but that's it) so I'll comment on something completely different:<br/><br/>That ancient city of yours sound awesome, Brian!

I think this is exactly the problem John is having with his character. The guy he invented is not really the guy we are seeing in play. Thus, his beliefs don't come out like James'.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: viktor_haag</cite>But you're not going to full feel comfortable with the rules after six or seven sessions, in my experience. All Luke's games (that I've seen so far: BW, BE, MG, and played: BW) are<i>deep</i>from a rules point of view. Learning the rules themselves may not be all that complex, but putting them in play effectively is<i>not</i>a simply learned task and one that takes time and patience.</blockquote>\nOne caveat: This is not my first BW game. I've played one-shots, and run a campaign. <br/><br/>That said, I agree. In fact, our original plan was to play 3-4 session, and we've already done that, with no plans to stop. So I expect the outline you're suggesting is probably just what we'll end up doing.<br/><br/>I do agree with you about using all the rules at once. That's what I did in my first BW campaign, and it was a big mess. Per my original post in this thread, the three of us are very explicit about introducing rules-sets slowly. So far we haven't used Fight!, Range and Cover, Duel of Wits, or the magic system at all.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: DeBracy</cite>That ancient city of yours sound awesome, Brian! (consider it yoink'd)</blockquote>\nThanks. It was a product of mutual creation.<br/><br/>We also have a wiki set up to document the city as it evolves through play.

Maybe think about risks he has taken, times he has pushed for conflicts in the game and make Beliefs about those actions.<br/><br/>Beliefs:<br/>-- The Witches' Council can't be allowed to use this act of terror to justify a pogrom. I'll return to the overcity with the Black Hand... or his head.<br/>-- Surhan [the other PC] can't see the big picture. I will show him that we're up against a greater evil than he knows.<br/>-- The Saxons nee our help to defeat the evil Watu [a neighboring empire], but they must respect us. I'll prove my worth, and, thus, my people's.<br/><br/>If he isn't sticking it to the Witches' Council, showing Surhan the evil at hand and proving himself to the Saxons aggressively, he needs to re-write 'em based on what he -is- doing.<br/><br/>Good luck!<br/><br/>Please post how it goes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_202371">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202371/#Comment_202371" name="Item_52" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-16T16:21:22+00:00" title="April 16, 2009  4:21PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for the commentary, all.

It's not that there's anything wrong with the beliefs, it's just the player changed his mind what he wants to play.  I just went through this in my game we're 6 (okay 9, including world/char burning, a short session, and trait vote/screw off sessions) sessions in.  We kind of knew that some of the beliefs and instincts weren't quite on, but I let us get to a stopping point (everyone was still hitting a shared belief really hard) to keep from interrupting the pacing.  I'm so much more excited for the game after the rewrites.<br/><br/>FYI: so far the players earned an average of 5.3 fate and 6.3 persona.  I have only 3 players (sometimes 2), so workhorse &amp; MVP are big part of that count here too.<br/><br/>Keep in mind that you don't even have to use Bloody Versus.  You can just do a normal versus test with Intent and failure consequences.  I find this very useful for fights where wounds aren't what we care about, but what the outcome is.<br/><br/>Also, in my experience 'planning' doesn't work well in BW, unless you are tying it to some tests.  If you aren't rolling dice for a while push things along until there's some conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_202831">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PaulB" title="PaulB"><img alt="PaulB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/998/n83RMVVXIW6PI.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PaulB">PaulB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/202831/#Comment_202831" name="Item_55" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-04-20T16:44:09+00:00" title="April 20, 2009  4:44PM">April 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh man, nothing more satisfying than a one-roll beatdown: "They win, the rape gang gets you.
