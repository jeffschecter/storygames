I could be wrong.<br/><br/>This is one of those things that can be argued any which way, as the consistent simulation depends on so many factors in big-picture mechanical approach and the precise fictional situation. And then there's the gameability issue - what kind of archery/melee interaction the designer wants.<br/><br/>I myself prefer maximum flex and simulation consistency, so shooting into melee is all "first you have to choose how much risk you're willing to take" and circumstance modifiers. Sometimes it's actually easier than the equivalent shot against a non-engaged enemy, other times it's near impossible to hit the enemy due to the ally being in the way.<br/><br/>One of the good bits in not having a general rule is that hijinks are possible given players willing to work the archery angle. For example, one would assume that given mobile combatants with facile footwork, with 1-minute rounds, it should be possible for your melee companion to actively encourage the enemy to trade places with him, leaving the foe's back open for the archer. And so it is.<br/><br/>Probably the biggest issue that archers have in our campaign is that they tend to be played by players who are not interested in the "scrum" that the melee front line engages in. This causes a deficit in group coordination such that the archer is often left stupidly starting at a tactical situation that leaves them no good opportunity to actually shoot. A player of some tactical flavour of D&amp;D (the sort that's all about the action economy) would start climbing the walls, looking at how one third of the party might be spending their actions in the fight "waiting for an open angle to take a shot".<br/><br/>I do not find it incredible as a GM that a group taking proper precautions should be able to leave open firing opportunities for their archers, melee or not. But then again, I find it fully credible that archery is a suboptimal tactical choice for a dungeon environment in general, so there's that [grin].                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464295">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464295/#Comment_464295" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-25T03:04:34+00:00" title="June 25, 2017  3:04AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love the attempt at simulation Eero describes, with all the possibilities that opens up.

There are so many potential variables and I'm not sure which ones actually matter.<br/><br/>When I GM simulation RPGs, what works for the players works for NPCs too.  So the players might enjoy coming up with a clever way to shoot enemies in the back... until it's used later on them.<br/><br/>Those stakes are why I'm loathe to hand-wave the modeling accuracy and just do whatever seems fun and plausible in the moment.<br/><br/>One-size-fits-all rules generally disappoint me at simulation time, but this might be one of the cases where it's hard to beat something simple and generic.                          </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464299">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464299/#Comment_464299" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-25T06:45:43+00:00" title="June 25, 2017  6:45AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoops, I forgot to write down my own preference (which I did in the other thread) \u2014 we do it the 5e way, you can just blast away all day every day!

An overly-complicated rule where you weight the chance of getting hit by numbers and size (Small creatures count as 1/2 a Medium creature, and Large-but-not-too-Large creatures count as 1.5 Medium creatures) and then roll randomly to see who gets hit.

Because a large party with bows can win any fight if they can shoot at will\u2014they absolutely dominate wilderness encounters, especially because of two shots per round. I still occasionally find myself having to make up a roll for how many goblins have slings or men-at-arms have crossbows but it's fine. Goblins just throw stones tbh I'll just roll with it.<br/><br/>I like: the idea that it codifies that charging is necessary, even for the players when fighting giants or other missile-capable foes. I like that sometimes the Fighter in magic armour is going up against a high-damage low-HP foe and will decide in the moment to call for missiles from the archer because they'd rather take a small risk on friendly arrows than let the monster live another round.<br/><br/>I also like that it means you take spears into the dungeon instead of bows, and hire a torch-bearer to pass you a new one every round if you are in a ranged encounter for whatever reason.<br/><br/>Edit: Labyrinth Lord specifically says that missiles can only be used when 5 feet away from a foe, I assume this is a direct import from one of the basic rulesets.

But the rule in question in my OP is about this situation: you are C. Your friend B is fighting your enemy A. They are close to each other, tangled up in a fight, but you are let's say 30 feet away.  I.e. further than 5 feet. Can you, C, shoot A?<br/><br/>5e gives you restrictions (well, disadvantage) on shooting someone at point blank. (I always introduce this rule as "Weirdly enough... but that's the rule!". B/c as you note, it's a pretty necessary rule!) But I haven't found any rules in 5e against C shooting A in the above situation.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464350">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/adamwb" title="adamwb"><img alt="adamwb" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/adamwb">adamwb</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464350/#Comment_464350" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-26T22:49:32+00:00" title="June 26, 2017 10:49PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, LL seems to be closely imitating RC, both have oddly phrased versions that could be read as barring missiles from targeting those close to their foes, and thus including hand-to-hand, but don't definitively say so. It is Holmes basic that sets is clearly:\n<blockquote>Once the party is engaged in melee, arrows can not be fired into the fight because of the probability of hitting friendly characters.</blockquote>\n---<br/><br/>But overall I think about it in this way: these rules only make sense if they have a clean way to establish when they work. My impression is that perhaps it was decided that bc 5e withdrew so much from the previous two editions use of the combat grid, they no longer had a way to measure what \u201cin mel\xe9e\u201d is. This is maybe the same as the reduction of importance of opportunity attacks here (I don't know 5e enough to say for sure).<br/><br/>I've begun to think about \u201cThe Mel\xe9e\u201d as a distinct thing in my game. I still have a few places that refer to \u201cmel\xe9e weapons\u201d but I am trying to take them out in favour of hand-to-hand or the like. For instance, we only roll initiative in the Mel\xe9e\u2014usually, combat begins with formations meeting each other or a surprise round, neither of which call for initiative rolls. It is only as these these break down that things get messy\u2014and at that point it's easy enough to change the rules of missile combat, and I think it works in this context.<br/><br/>But this is in many ways a back-justification, me being enchanted with my own reading of evocative terms and weird rules like this one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_464360">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/2097" title="2097"><img alt="2097" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/107/nO4LZ6SDEDHCJ.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/2097">2097</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464360/#Comment_464360" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-27T05:51:52+00:00" title="June 27, 2017  5:51AM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<p>BTW, I just did find a rule making it harder to shoot into m\xeal\xe9e in 5e \u2013 <a href="https://open5e.com/combat/cover.html" rel="nofollow">cover!</a> So I guess the rule is you get +2 to AC.

(I wish they had had more consistency there\u2026 i.e.\xa0sneak attack trickers on 5 feet, wish it had triggered on reach instead. 5 feet is the default reach but polearms.) There are very few rules that care about other distances. It\u2019s clear that \u201cin m\xeal\xe9e\u201d is <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/20652/spatial-relationships-in-verbal-games/p1" rel="nofollow">part of the grammar of 5e\u2019s predicate spatiality</a>.</p>\n<p>And there are a couple of rules that trigger on entering or on leaving that reach / leaving that 5 feet radius.</p>\n<p>Including the topic at hand, shooting arrows. Not only is it harder to shoot at point blank, it\u2019s harder for you to shoot <em>anyone</em> if someone is within 5 feet of you.</p>\n<p>In \u201cOrdinary Fight\u201d, my house system of adjudicating theatre of the mind fighting, I <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/464317/#Comment_464317" rel="nofollow">extracted</a> a <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/discussion/comment/464318/#Comment_464318" rel="nofollow">concrete semantic unit</a>, which I\u2019ve variably called \u201cfray\u201d or \u201cm\xeal\xe9e group\u201d [the latter name is the current name as of 2017-06-27].</p>\n<p>What we do is instead of tracking specific positions and specific distances, we track who is in which m\xeal\xe9e group. If Rothgar is fighting Allie in m\xeal\xe9e, they\u2019ve created a m\xeal\xe9e group that they\u2019re part of, and then Vorthos joins that fray and starts fighting Allie too, now Vorthos is also part of the m\xeal\xe9e group. And if Allie then leaves the m\xeal\xe9e group, that triggers opportunity attacks from the rest of the m\xeal\xe9e group. The rule is that your movement speed if unencumbered is enough to go between m\xeal\xe9e groups or stand outside any m\xeal\xe9e group.</p>\n<p>So there are X+1 predicate spaces: one for each m\xeal\xe9e group, and \u201coutside m\xeal\xe9e\u201d. It seldom matters exactly how many feet there are between each group or the angles etc.<br/><br/>Reach is handled by a special rule (if you have longer reach, you can get others to \u201cstick to\u201d you without you \u201csticking to\u201d them).</p>\n<p>I have made rules for some special cases, three so far: Thorn Whip, Ray of Frost, and Fire Elemental\u2019s \u201cwalk through\u201d ability.

Similar to how the card game \u201cMagic\u201d puts a <em>lot</em> of tactics into just two states (tapped/untapped, and blocked/unblocked), in 5e joining/leaving \u201cThe M\xeal\xe9e\u201d \u2014 or rather, joining \u201c<strong>A</strong> M\xeal\xe9e\u201d since moving between concurrently ongoing m\xeal\xe9e groups matters a lot \u2014 is a <em>big</em> deal and part of how they can make a simple system be interestingly tactical. (Of course me haspling out phrases like \u201cX+1 predicate spaces\u201d is <em>not</em> part of 5e. That\u2019s only for you guys!)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019ve begun to think about \u201cThe Mel\xe9e\u201d as a distinct thing in my game.

One of the party members had bogarted a few jewels in the previous session, and another decided wisely to assassinate him for them. The plan was to get the target alone, wait for an opportune moment and stab them to death with a covert knife. Classic case, so of course I suggested that we make use of the new concepts introduced in this thread.<br/><br/>(My traditional way of solving this sort of thing has been with a simple ability check against a specially-calculated assassination DC, with success causing a save against dying for the target. A different mechanical basis that sidesteps hitpoints altogether in favour of a spell-like effect triggered by a successful skill check, in other words.)<br/><br/>I ran this by telling the player of the target that he was targeted by an assassin and by talking out the rules in advance before we started rolling - he didn't get to know who the assassin was (the idea was that by having the GM play out the scene, the perpetrator could escape suspicion from the other adventurers) to begin with.<br/><br/>My mechanical implementation (obviously specific to my bastardized homebrew D&amp;D rules) essentially had the target AC increase by +2 for every accumulated aim action, so there is still a practical limit to how much aim damage a character can accumulate before they have to use it or lose it. Otherwise it was pretty much as speculated here.<br/><br/>The target had 8 hit points (this is one of the major PCs in the campaign - we play hard stakes), and the assassin ended up garnering two dice of damage before on the third die the target twigged that his supposed companion was acting strange (tense, hiding a dagger under a cloak, etc.); initiative was rolled at this point, which the assassin won, meaning that they could deliver their damage without interference. The assassin got a third die of damage for their strike, but as it happened, their damage dice were quite entirely rotten: a total of 7 damage off 3d6 meant that the target was still in the fight after the savage surprise blow.<br/><br/>The target PC escaped the situation crying for help from nearby allies; the would-be assassin was apprehended. It happened to be the case that the party had just gotten out of trouble with changelings, and were preparing for a major assault, which meant that sufficient uncertainty was generated about the events (e.g. was the assassin really this guy we arrested, or was it one more changeling?) that the party and their NPC allies decided to spare the poor plotter.<br/><br/>Result: seems good so far, will try again.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464515">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464515/#Comment_464515" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-07-01T01:45:24+00:00" title="July  1, 2017  1:45AM">July 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteAuthor"><a href="/forums/profile/Eero_Tuovinen" rel="nofollow">Eero_Tuovinen</a> said:</div><div class="QuoteText"><p>My mechanical implementation (obviously specific to my bastardized homebrew D&amp;D rules) essentially had the target AC increase by +2 for every accumulated aim action, so there is still a practical limit to how much aim damage a character can accumulate before they have to use it or lose it.
