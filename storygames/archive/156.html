                    So, to move another idea out of the shadow of brain damage. <br/><br/>If you have found that your ability to tell stories in games has been damaged by years of "storytelling" games that don't tell stories -- or only let one person at the table force a story onto everyone else, what are you going to do to fix it? For yourself? For your group? For "them?" <br/><br/>For me I've done a few things. The first Levi and Tony have already talked about -- for a long time I stepped my "storytelling" self right out of RPGs and into other venues. I learned to write stories I liked again, and worked at length on my oral storytelling skills. That did a lot to fix my personal damage. <br/><br/>However, I was still damaged towards telling stories in a game for years. Two things have helped me shake out of that pattern of behaviors. <br/><br/>The first is playing games the divert radically from the old mode. Playing Dogs, Dust Devils, and PTA has forced me to redefine my relationship to game and story. When you have narration rights passing around the table at lightning speed, you find that a lot of the old garbage goes out the window quickly. Systems that give solid support to the structure of conflict rather than the random resolution of tasks helped me a lot. A lot lot. <br/><br/>Heroquest gets special mention here, as it was the first game that made me click over hard. Dust Devils would get second place, as the passing of naration kneecapped me in a brutal way and made me totally rethink the way I looked at games constructing story. It is also worth noting that I was -very- uncomfortable with both of these games at start up, and it took some sustained effort to build up the skills to use them correctly. <br/><br/>The second thing I did was my whole rather flailing "no metanormals in the game" stance that John Kim chided me for on Yud's dice. In retrospect a lot of things I said on that matter were silly -- there is no essential reason that a story of a superhero with a cape can't be as non-geeky and honestly story oriented as the story of Joe Dork. <br/><br/>However, there was a reason for me. Many games have historically focused on cool powers as the point of the game. Really, Vampire talks a lot about horror but most Vampire players I know are more about having Potence 5 than having personal horror. So, for me, it was an important step to (temporarily at least) have games in which there were no cool powers, no cool positions, no cool gadgets or gear. Take all that away and I was forced to look at the stories the way I look at stories that I tell or write -- as experssions of the aspects and conflicts of humanity that interest me. <br/><br/>The game Mo and I are working on, 1000 Stories, is an outgrowth of both of the above. In that game there is no metanormalness, there is only normal people in a normal place at moments of emotional crisis. The resulting shift in thinking has not only let us tell better stories of that nature, but to tell better stories in the games where we still have metanormals and funky powers.                </div>

<p>My storytelling skills (particularly in games) aren't what I'd like them to be.  What am I going to do?  I'm going to tell stories, play games, test out new techniques and carefully consider how they work and what I can try next.</p>
<p>Other people's storytelling skills (particularly in games) aren't what I'd like them to be.  What am I going to do?  I'm going to try to create games that provide both a good, rollicking fun time <em>and</em> solid tools for repeated, valuable practice leading to improved storytelling skills.  Then I'm going to encourage them to do what I do:  practice, consider, theorize, test, practice.</p>
<p>This next bit could come across as <strong>incredibly arrogant</strong>, but I genuinely mean it in the most humble "My boat is so small and the ocean so large" way:  The question here puzzles me.  Is there something <em>else</em> we can be doing, other than what I list above?</p>

                            Well, I agree with Brand's #1.  To the extent that I've encountered this, my #1 solution is to say in bold terms: "Forget about story!  Story sucks, and it's not what our role-playing is about.  Role-playing is a creative endeavor unto itself, and you have to treat it as its own thing."  <br/>
<br/>
I'd also second his call to try out new stuff.  Online gaming, live-action, diceless, freeform, and narrational tabletop are part of the variety that give you perspective.  For that matter, if you want to develop as a storyteller, forget role-playing for a bit and try just telling some stories.  If you want to develop as an actor, try acting.  Both of those will develop skills which you can bring back to role-playing.  <br/>
<br/>
For my personal development in gaming, the biggest difference wasn't superhuman-vs-human, but rather narrowing the scope of the game.  Dealing with homesteads instead of worlds; and families instead of cities.  This was the hugest contrast between my Star Trek game (which I liked) and my Vinland game (which I loved).                        </div>

<p><code>Like when you designed Capes, what kinds of skills were you looking at improving or supporting? When you play it with others what skills do you see them lacking before play and strengthing durring play?</code></p>
<p>Capes is made to teach people how to view competing as a friendly activity that can lead to powerful story.  This has two sides:  One, they learn to figure out exactly what their friends want, and to challenge it.  Two, they overcome their fear of saying exactly what they want ... because there's nothing to fear.  Worst-case scenario, somebody immediately sets about denying you what you want.  Fun!</p>
<p>Outside of RPGs, this translates into an increased understanding of the place of conflict.</p>
<p><code>If you were to redo Capes, what thing would you put in to support those of us who suck so much that we love Capes but can't manage to use it to make a good story?</code></p>
<p>Oh, I don't know.  Maybe conflicts would not refer directly to the fiction:  They would have to be phrased, when you wrote them down, as "<strong>I</strong> want X to happen," or "<strong>You</strong> want Y to happen."  And it would have to be true, at the time it was written, or you couldn't add it to the game.</p>

                            I have Once Upon A Time.  I also have a little game of my own called Parables, now.  And I have Dogs In The Vineyard.<br/>
<br/>
The first two games, to me, are for playing 'around' habits that get in the way of collaborative storytelling in games.  The last one, to me, is for fusing that new experience back to roleplaying.<br/>
<br/>
Works pretty well for me, though I keep needing to skip back to the beginning and working back over to break up little clumps of habit that are in my way.<br/>
<br/>
And, yeah, been doing this for a couple months.  Didn't think anything of it, until now.<br/>
<br/>
EDIT: This whole post sounds weird - this is because my perspective is jumping around a little as I assimilate what I think of the whole issue.  Look at it more as "me in the middle of noticing what I've been doing, from a different  perspective" rather than "me talking about stuff I already knew", and we're cooking with gas.                        </div>

I've been pulling it out recently as a tool for "getting people 'into' story so I can get them into Dogs."<br/>

The more I look at that, though, the more I'm coming to see it as "I've been using it to break down habits without realizing it".<br/>

<p>It's <em>very good,</em> this expansion. The endings it adds are much more difficult to build up to; rather than being stereotypical story closing remarks, they actually refer back to events that must have occurred, in a fairly explicit fashion; compare these two new endings</p>

                            Brand's just bitter because he once introduced the Wolf King who was stalking some innocent victim and then my brother took up narration and had the Wolf King go get a latte from Starbucks.                        </div>

                            Ditto the dittoing.<br/><br/>One of my favorite campaigns of all time only lasted 4-5 sessions, but I ran a OUAT-derrived game we called "Folkways" for a group of 4 girls, only 1 of whom had ever really roleplayed before.  They were kids on this island off Nova Scotia who lived next to the Woods (as in an <i>Into The Woods</i> woods, where storybook things tended to happen).  The players each had a handful of cards that they could play to invoke cool storybook stuff.  And I sorta freeform GMed the rest of it.<br/><br/>It's was 200% of pure rock.                        </div>

                            ...That does, indeed, sound like a giant bag of awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I must call around the local game store, and ask:<br/>
<br/>
Johnathan, did you have any written rules for this?  Because, if you did, I want them.                        </div>
