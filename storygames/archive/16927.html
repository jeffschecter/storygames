Hence, own thread.  At any rate, I tried out S/lay w/ Me with my wife tonight.  I was the GM first and she was the GM second.<br/><br/>She chose \u201cI am a demon\u2019s child and heir to its power, but I am beautiful and good\u201d and our location was \u201cwhat remains from when they tried to dig to hell.\u201d  This strong thematic connection led to her goal of breaking free from her heritage by finding someone who could look upon her true face and love her.   She was slight of build, tall, and golden.  Her Lover was the lone and lonely guard patrolling the hole to hell.  The monsters were snake/goat/men charged by her father to return her to the kingdom of her birth and her fate.  The coolest bit, I thought, was how I kept making the noises for the wind across the plain and eventually my wife realized the wind was saying her character\u2019s name (Usalus, lots of lovely sibilants there).  Of course, it was actually the snake/goat/men.  She refused to go with them and fought to defend her Lover from them.  In the end, she lay dying from wounds inflicted by the Monsters and revealed her true form to him: golden snakes for hair, jagged gemstones for eyes, vicious fangs  and a snake tail.  He gently closed her gemstone eyes and caressed her writing snakes and everywhere he touched turned back to normal.  He held her as her green blood bled out and faded to red and her body returned to human, loved and accepted and no longer a demon\u2019s heir.<br/><br/>I picked \u201cMy songs are beloved wherever I go, but I fear they sow doom and horror in my wake\u201d and the location of \u201cThe Crystal Court, whose queen remains unknown.\u201d  I was a regal elf, one of the last of my people, trying to save them from extinction by harnessing the power of the queen.  I was very disappointed to find the only other person in the first scene was the gardener.  Knowing the rules, I knew this was to be my Lover.  He was pretty rude and boring and after telling me where to go he literally disappeared.  Turns out some of this was my wife misunderstanding how to choose the attributes for the Lover and Monster.  Anyway, I find the queen and she\u2019s also the Monster.  She\u2019s sitting on a pile of bones and I use the magic of my song to shatter them and she sinks into the stabbing shards.  We attack back and forth and the gardener shows up in livery, declares he\u2019s the queens heir, and hands me a dagger with which to kill her.  I say I don\u2019t want to kill her, I want to keep her as a magical battery I can drain off to save my people.  I imprison her in a cage of bone, singing so forcefully I fall to my knees gushing blood from my mouth (I also toppled her dice, see House Rules below).  Turns out that drawing off her power also draws off her heir, and my putative Lover fades from existence as I increase my strength and heal my wounds so my people may go on.<br/><br/>- - -<br/><br/>I\u2019m sort of mixed on the game right now.  I liked our stories, but there were some real draggy parts.  I think it might be better if we played it again since we have the rules (more or less) down.<br/><br/><i>My advice for play: <br/></i><br/>Avoid talking back and forth to each other in dialogue.  Make things happen that push the action forward.   Make statements instead of asking questions.<br/><br/>Make the lover immediately sticky.  If he/she isn\u2019t endearing then there\u2019s no tough decision between achieve goal/save lover/kill monster.<br/><br/><i>House rules:  </i><br/><br/>If you want  to topple the GM\u2019s stack o\u2019 dice you have to do something sacrificial in the fiction.  You\u2019re radically altering the mechanical situation, so you need to radically alter the narrative situation.  This worked well for.<br/><br/>If tied after the match, you both roll one more die.  I feel like this could\u2019ve been more elegant, but it worked alright.<br/><br/>Anyone else played recently and care to chime in?<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_385566">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Khimus" title="Khimus"><img alt="Khimus" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Khimus">Khimus</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385566/#Comment_385566" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-22T01:16:53+00:00" title="July 22, 2012  1:16AM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Remember not every session has "save lover in danger" as a possible goal. The lover might just be there to have the player choose between staying with him, leaving alone or taking him with the hero on his next adventure. But that doesn\xb4t cost any "good die" in the climax (page 19).\n<blockquote>If you want to topple the GM\u2019s stack o\u2019 dice you have to do something sacrificial in the fiction. You\u2019re radically altering the mechanical situation, so you need to radically alter the narrative situation. This worked well for.</blockquote>\nThis isn\xb4t bad, but the point in the fiction where you (RAW) make sacrifices is during the climax, so I would only ask for "color sacrifice" like breaking your sword, receiving some wounds or something like that. The "topple" exists mainly to improve the winning-odds of the hero, not to force a thematical choice. Otherwise you have a harder game for your hero (which may be the intention).\n<blockquote>Avoid talking back and forth to each other in dialogue. Make things happen that push the action forward. Make statements instead of asking questions.</blockquote>\nI don\xb4t understand this completely. Prior to the match, there might be "goes" that are primarily color, like the character exploring idly an old dungeon, before focusing on his goal. Regarding "asking questions", I agree, it\xb4s not appropriate to do it always, but I used it a little both times I GMed S/lw/M and it worked fine.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_385599">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Keith" title="Keith"><img alt="Keith" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://profile.ak.fbcdn.net/hprofile-ak-snc4/41781_139848736039153_8022_q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Keith">Keith</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/385599/#Comment_385599" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-07-22T18:19:03+00:00" title="July 22, 2012  6:19PM">July 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Remember not every session has "save lover in danger" as a possible goal. </blockquote>\nTrue.  I could have phrased that better.  The lover doesn't necessarily need saving all the time, but it's one of the ways of making him important.  If the lover doesn't distinguish himself, the whole lover/monster/goal triangle kind of falls apart and, IMO, that's one of the coolest bits of the game.<br/><br/>Re: sacrifice, I think you and I are saying the same thing.  If you the player are going to knock over a stack of dice (which I find sort of weird, anyway), you the character should be doing something, too.  I really dislike purely mechanical bits which is what it would be otherwise (i.e. I knocked over your dice so I can have a higher total than you) and be totally non-immersive.<br/><br/>The part about talking back and forth in dialogue, I mean talking back and forth in character.  Color bits are fine, but at least in my limited experience, talking back and forth as Hero and Lover gets stagnant really quickly.  I think <span style="text-decoration: underline;">show</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">do</span> work better than <span style="text-decoration: underline;">tell</span> in S/lay w/ Me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
