It was a person who says they've had a love/hate relationship with the idea for ten years. They always come back to it but then reject it. The reason was simple.<br/><br/>Too much freedom of action quickly dries up the well of creativitiy and quickly gets repetitive or esculates into sillyness. <br/><br/>I'm the Engle of EMGs and I hate to say it but I've seen the same problem. Heck I don't want to make up stuff all the time. Making up stuff seems like it should be easy but it isn't. I'm working on ways to give players a steady stream of outside input to keep games working but that is ducking the issue.<br/><br/>What is it about freedom that is so difficult?<br/><br/>One thing has to be the Czege Principle - where making up your own conflict is unsatisfying. <br/><br/>I can also see that our brains are good at pattern recognition but maybe no pattern creation. <br/><br/>I want to hear other people's ideas. Examples are even more helpful.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325805">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325805/#Comment_325805" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T06:56:06+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  6:56AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            EXAMPLE: A Horror Story<br/><br/>There are four players sitting down to a game. They are told that it will be a horror story. They have a map and a cast of shifty characters. They are given an opening paragraph about their having to spend the night in the spooky house where someone died years before. <br/><br/>That's it. <br/><br/>Beyond that, the system says you can make up actions that happen next. There are some kind of die rolls but bascially people are narrating the story - making it up as they go.<br/><br/>There is a plot track that suggests what should happen in the game: Find clues, reveal the plot, have a big fight, aftermath.<br/><br/>That is it. <br/><br/>Many players stare at this and don't know what to do next. If one player steps up and makes a provocative move (basically becoming the bad guy) the others react against them and crush the first player. They are defeated - a fun game was had but only because a player step up to make it happen. Not because the game presented lead to that. <br/><br/>This is what I've seen happen with a lot of Matrix Games. <br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325808">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325808/#Comment_325808" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T07:10:25+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  7:10AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've had a similar experience when people have too many feats to choose from, etc.  I thought choice paralysis was just a word everybody used for this, but now I'm wondering if I invented it...<br/><br/>(google: Nope, I didn't invent it, they just call it Analysis Paralysis)<br/><br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis</a><br/><br/>Choosing ANYTHING as the next "clue" in an Engle Matrix game means rejecting 10^9 other possible choices.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325809">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325809/#Comment_325809" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T07:11:48+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  7:11AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, I think playing a ghostpunk Engle Matrix game with Ghost/ECHO in front of you would help.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_325810">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325810/#Comment_325810" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T07:13:33+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  7:13AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think, perhaps, that "game" is the problem.<br/><br/>Or at least one problem.

They assume that you'll either figure it out by playing with veterans, or you'll just make something up and it's kind of not their problem. <br/>Don't get me wrong - plenty of these games have lots of suggestions about what to do, but they don't nail anything down. They just kind of fill in the world with possibilities and tell you to have at it (<i>Vampire</i>, I'm looking at you). In my experience, it's a lack of personal connection to anything in the story that lends itself to stereotypically sociopathic play - if I don't have a reason to care about anything or anyone, what's to stop me from just re-enacting Grand Theft Auto in your game? That could be what you want, but it often isn't.<br/><br/>By contrast, a game like Kagematsu has them doing exactly one kind of story - the players are all women in a Japanese village in the 16th century. Their village is in trouble, and it is beyond the skill of the villagers to solve it. They must woo the traveler, Kagematsu, to ensure the survival of their community. Sociopathic behavior in that game would be overtly disruptive, and essentially outside the bounds of potential play. Being a sociopath is not acceptable - if your character doesn't have human feelings, the slow, delicate growth of intimacy between Kagematsu and the village women cannot happen as the rules describe it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325823">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325823/#Comment_325823" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T08:28:01+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  8:28AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            At least gonzo sociopaths impose a structure on the game.

Because he had this apparatus of self-judgment, ideas of what made a good contribution or a bad contribution. (At the end of the game, I said, "So - that was Fiasco."

If you ask someone "what do you want to eat?" they have a much easier time picking off a menu than giving you instructions for what to buy at a grocery store. The idea of infinite choice seems to have lots of promise, so giving up that "freedom" for whatever particular thing you actually put forward doesn't seem like a good tradeoff to your subconscious, so you start to find reasons to not say anything. It's even worse if someone says "You can say anything you want!" because then that raises to social pressure -- if what you say ends up being lame then your friends will think "what you want" is a lame story. When you have creative constraints and things to react to it's much easier to offer ideas because it doesn't <i>feel</i> like taking on the burden of "creating" something, it feels more natural and less like you're exposing yourself to potential judgment or criticism. <br><br>In RPGs, I tend to start off slow and need to build momentum in order to connect with my character and engage with the fiction. If there's nothing to hook me in (either interesting mechanics that encourage me to do interesting things, or a compelling situation I need to react to) then things are usually really flat for me and I have trouble contributing. I often have trouble with games that expect characters to be strongly motivated right out of the gate in order to generate the gameplay.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_325913">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/325913/#Comment_325913" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-23T13:37:52+00:00" title="May 23, 2011  1:37PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 23, 2011 1:40PM by jdfristrom.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: furashgf</cite>Could someone point me to more details on the "Czege Principle."

Play may well be fun in a narrative game when one person authors the adversity AND the resolution; it depends on the game. <br><br>In my newest design; ATLAS, the players regularly do this, and still the game is a lot of fun. Of course; they do get to roll the die, and must adhere to it in the resolution. And there's always the danger of failure, which force you to concede the narration of the resolution to one of the other players. That simple trick makes every die-roll exciting, and do a lot for the strong interactive feel of the game. Still; succeeding, and narrating how you succeed, is much of the fun in the game. And why should it not be?<br><br>But: I mention ATLAS mostly due to the fact that the game has a lot of freedom, with a minuscule system laying on top of an empty setting. The main framing mechanism is that you draw a part of the map each time you narrate something in the game, binding your character and its actions to the geography. The drawing of the map works as a mentally focussing element in the game, and makes it easy to play with. I believe it works like this; you get a blank sheet of paper, and don't know nothing about how you should fill it. But then you set pen to the paper, and while the lines are formed, your mind grows, letting your imagination take off and fly, by the fact that you don't focus on it; you focus on drawing the simple lines. Its kind of; when you take your mind off it, the imagination will grow wings.<br><br>My sons (8 and 11) manages the game nicely by themselves, playing for themselves and with friends. We've had silly play with it, and serious play, and have had fun playing either way. It's fast and furious, and have a focussing action at the core of the method, and that makes for a lot of fun!                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326048">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326048/#Comment_326048" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T00:45:27+00:00" title="May 24, 2011 12:45AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>A second, less common problem - you *did* have an idea what to add.

I've often found playing something like 3.5 or 4e that by the time my initiative comes up, the idea I was working on since my previous action doesn't work anymore. If things change too often, there's no point in planning. If you're not planning, you're not as interested in what's going on, and you're also forced to think something up a lot quicker. I think having some method of tagging in when your idea makes sense would work. Give everyone something like 2 action/narrative tokens. When an idea comes up, you can throw your token in and narrate it right away (or just take your action in a structured game), if you've thrown your second one in, you just have to wait until everyone uses theirs and they get divvied out again.<br><br>That's not necessarily affecting freedom, but it adds a bit more structure and provides a fair way for people to bring in ideas when they like without overwhelming everyone else.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326049">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326049/#Comment_326049" name="Item_22" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T00:49:46+00:00" title="May 24, 2011 12:49AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>My snarkiness was that I just googled it, as Gary could have, not that I had any problem with the principle itself.</blockquote>\nGreat way to make Story Games even more insular than it already is.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326052">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326052/#Comment_326052" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T02:30:02+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  2:30AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I beg to differ on that "principle"; it is false.

Anyway, it has a nifty mechanic that is decidedly theft-worthy.<br/><br/>The game has scene cards, a bit over a dozen. Each card has a very short, evocative title suggesting the topic of a scene ( each geared to the core concept of FY, namely life in High School) and a suggested number of main characters/PCs involved).<br/><br/>The cards are shuffled up at the start of the game, placed face-down and three are drawn and placed face up. The person taking the first scene can choose any of the three revealed cards as the basis of their scene. After the scene is over, a replacement card is drawn and play continues in this fashion.<br/><br/>(As a wrinkle, some cards say "Play Right Now;" if one or more of those are face up, those have priority over regular scene cards)<br/><br/>Now, I fully plan to steal some form of that mechanic for some stuff I'm noodling with. At bare minimum, it is a great set of training wheels for for folks who are just getting used to doing scene framing and staying kinda on track. It's also a pretty great idea for scenario based stuff where some direction is desirable, but too much constraint would feel like railroading.<br/><br/>It also seems like a mechanic that could be adapted a bit in a few simple ways to give a couple other ways to play that wouyld be pretty cool too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood" title="wyrmwood"><img alt="wyrmwood" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wyrmwood">wyrmwood</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326068/#Comment_326068" name="Item_26" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T05:31:43+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  5:31AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Czege Principle is distressingly vague about when a player is source of both adversity and resolution. You void the warranty if either of those decisions also involves 1) randomizers, 2) transformations of decisions made in a different context (i.e. chess doesn't violate the Czege principle if you view the main antagonism as the weight of your prior decisions), or 3) strong external goals (this is arguably why Prime Time Adventures <i>needs</i> fanmail). <br/><br/>In that vein it falls from the theory of RPGs that says enjoying playing an RPG means your experience is both structured and surprising from perspectives you are willing to take. In which case, the Czege principle just says: when you experience adversity and resolution in play if it is not surprising, play will be less fun. <br/><br/>  - Mendel                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326070">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326070/#Comment_326070" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T05:40:37+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  5:40AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Good idea Bob<br/><br/>The game rules I'm playing with this week (I've been going through a lot of total rewrites lately) are similar to this.<br/><br/>The game is ten turns long - divided into five chapters. Chapters have a built in topic and a default outcome if the players do not prevent it.<br/><br/>The first chapter is scenario building, which is all done roll on tables.<br/><br/>The remaining chapters have a set number of turns (3 - 3 - 3 - and 1) so players have a little while to accomplish the task. What mainly happens in turns though is doing things to score victory points. I'm directly rewarding appropriate story actions so people don't have to think to hard - just pick stuff from the menu and build your own shrimp feast (I've been to Red Lobster recently). <br/><br/>The last play test I did showed that this worked but I haven't repeated it to be certain. It puts the players in the position of filling in the blanks.<br/><br/>The players do not have to make up the chapters so they are not making up their own adversary and they do not have to make the evil plot move forward. It does that regardless of what they do. They just have to stop it.<br/><br/>Chris Engle                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326072">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326072/#Comment_326072" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T06:03:31+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  6:03AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Have you considered the possibility of having two victory tracks?<br/><br/>One is the obvious victory track, the one you already have built.<br/><br/>The second one is a player awarded victory track, basically a MP award (or awards, if you break the thing into categories, which I personally find a tempting course).<br/><br/>Essentially, at each break time (probably between chapters) players award a player or players some kind of vote in a given category. I'd keep it secret but it doesn't have to be secret. Anyway, I'd just total them up at the end. Make the categories behavior you want to encourage, but leave it to the judgment of the actual participants.<br/><br/>I actually played in a one-shot LARP a couple of years back.

Especially if the players know it's going to be a horror game going in; the last time I ran Dread it was a bit of a disaster.  On the other hand, some of the Mage games I've run have worked really well as horror, while not being explicitly such.  I think that somehow the expectation of something scary happens undermines the actual creation of scariness. <br/>\n<br/>\nThe discussion of 'analysis paralysis' is interesting.  <br/>\n<br/>\nI spent a couple years at an art school, which obviously involves being creative on a regular basis.  And of course, ruts develop and you get caught in patterns that you don''t necessarily want to be in.  But we had this great event once or twice every semester, the drawing marathon, which helped a lot with tis.  The setup was simple; some people would get together and draw for an entire weekend in one of the studios, with models on hand to draw and everything.  A combination of sleep deprivation and sheer tenacity were incredibly helpful for breaking through creative blocks.  Sure, there would be a lot of shit produced, but generally there were ideas in there that could be brought back an explored more thoroughly later.<br/>\n<br/>\nThinking back to gaming in high school, we had a lot of sleep deprivation there, as well, gaming til dawn with the stereotypical jugs of mountain dew...<br/>\n<br/>\nthe point is just that to escape analysis paralysis, sometimes people need a way to move beyond the limits of their every-day selves.  We build up walls in our minds that make the world easier to navigate, but which also act as limits on our creativity.  And yeah, this can very much be about setting aside the 'internal critic,' which is a very large wall.  <br/>\n<br/>\nThe big components of this, I think, is creating a space where <br/>\na) participants are outside of their usual sphere of experience, and<br/>\nb) it's safe to fail or to create something that sucks.<br/>\n<br/>\ngotta go teach!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326155">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/merb101" title="merb101"><img alt="merb101" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_O3QcSFU8cD8/TECcJ64n6dI/AAAAAAAACDo/YcvavrWaP3E/IMG_2743.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/merb101">merb101</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326155/#Comment_326155" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T12:12:30+00:00" title="May 24, 2011 12:12PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite><cite>Posted By: migo</cite><cite>Posted By: jdfristrom</cite>My snarkiness was that I just googled it, as Gary could have, not that I had any problem with the principle itself.</blockquote>\nGreat way to make Story Games even more insular than it already is.<br/><br/>Yes, and I apologized on another thread.<br/><br/>Could you point me to that thread?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326160">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326160/#Comment_326160" name="Item_32" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T12:33:59+00:00" title="May 24, 2011 12:33PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Too much freedom kills because creative ideas don't spring wholly formed from your imagination (contrary to the lies that Romantic poets told you).  Creativity works by building upon previous ideas.  if you say "Do anything", then that does not give the other person a useful starting point.  It's like trying to grow sugar crystals in a pot of hot water: you need a seed crystal for other things to start glomming onto, so that they can all crystallize as well.  Without a good starting idea that inspires more ideas, people get stuck with the blank page problem/writer's block/analysis paralysis.<br/><br/>When people are stuck for ideas, they look to the <a href="http://lumpley.com/comment.php?entry=492" rel="nofollow">random media crap-soul we all swim in</a>, and pull out the easiest idea.  Not the best idea, but the easiest one.  The simplest, laziest, most likely to provoke laughter from your friends idea.  Silly ideas don't require a lot of thought, but give immediate positive feedback if the idea is silly enough to provoke laughter.  So when people are stuck, they go for the simple, goofy answers that don't require much effort, rather than finding the best idea out of the thousands of possible answers.<br/><br/><br/>If you give them some seed content, then the players have something to build upon, something to crystalize their story around.  This organizing principle means that they can start to make decisions based on what is best rather than on what is easiest.  Good seed content starts the creative process going.  <a href="http://mrteapot.livejournal.com/82528.html" rel="nofollow">Random die rolls spur on the creativity pretty well</a>, while more evocative seed content like Ganakagok's Tarot deck work even better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326171">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/cy" title="cy"><img alt="cy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/cy">cy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326171/#Comment_326171" name="Item_33" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T13:13:08+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  1:13PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2011 1:14PM by cy.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite><br/>Could you point me to that thread?</blockquote>\n<a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14350&amp;page=1#Item_7" rel="nofollow">http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=14350&amp;page=1#Item_7</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326211">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste" title="AccountingForTaste"><img alt="AccountingForTaste" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/617/nJ18302DIPLOB.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/AccountingForTaste">AccountingForTaste</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326211/#Comment_326211" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T16:22:57+00:00" title="May 24, 2011  4:22PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Accounting for Taste</cite><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite>I beg to differ on that "principle"; it is false.

Probably more than on the game, really.Why? How come? Could you be a bit more specific? I do see that if you give two players the same, freeform game to play with, they will most likely respond in very different ways to it. But I'd like you to elaborate on this all the same, if you would. Please?<br/>Because people don't all enjoy the same things in the same ways, basically.  Seems kind of obvious.<br/><br/>Some people loooooove being in the limelight, if you give them a chance to narrate the adversity and the resolution and everything else, they'll do it, and love having everyone paying attention to them.  Other people don't, and don't like being forced into a position where they're basically monologuing to the crowd ("This is my problem, and this is how I solved it...thanks for listening, you've been a great audience!").  Some people like being surprised (or even just having the possibility of being surprised) by how something turns out, and it's impossible to be surprised when you're the one who decides how it turns out.  Some people like deciding certain things but not others, depending on the circumstances in the game or what their profession is or how they're feeling that particular evening.  Name an opinion someone could have about this, and someone out there has that opinion.<br/><br/>So, yeah, the game you're playing can affect whether the Czege Principle holds true or not, but so can the individuals playing the game, and the bottom line -- the part where the game lives or dies -- is right there with those individuals.  It doesn't matter how wonderful you think your system is, it's not going to fly with someone who doesn't want the experience it's offering.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_326257">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326257/#Comment_326257" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-24T23:41:50+00:00" title="May 24, 2011 11:41PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 24, 2011 11:48PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yes, it's obvious that people are different, in certain respects.<br/><br/>Some people will, when facing total freedom, make their own frames, within which  their imagination will roam. For some this is second-nature, so they have less problems with too much freedom. I do believe that they still face some problems with it, and prefer to have their imagination tickled by the framing of a well designed game.<br/><br/>Saying that the game you are playing, and the people playing a game, can affect wether the "Czege principle" holds true, is in fact saying that it is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not true</span>, as a principle. It is indeed possible to let the player be the author of both the character's adversity and its resolution, and that way of doing it will lead some players to fun gameplay. There is nothing more to that debate, in my view.<br/><br/><b>As for the point of too much freedom killing games; it certainly does.</b> <br/>Why? Well, I believe we need a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">methodic framework</span> or some <span style="text-decoration: underline;">thematic feed</span> for our imagination to work well. In most games we get both; certain procedures to follow when building the game fiction (methodic framework), and certain setting-elements to start us off building that fiction (thematic feed). <br/><br/>When both method and theme is lacking, we are left to provide the feed and framework by ourselves, and that is not easy in a group of different wills, dreams and imaginative powers. In some groups such a starting point is no starting point at all (no interaction), and in a lot of other groups it is the start of seriously flawed gameplay (neurotic interaction, ending in silliness or lack of engaging dilemmas).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326259">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326259/#Comment_326259" name="Item_36" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T00:00:53+00:00" title="May 25, 2011 12:00AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There may be one really simple thing that folks are missing that the Czege Principle does at least point at side-ways.<br/><br/>If you don't both create and resolve your own adversity, it kinda implies that someone else does do one of those two things.<br/><br/>Which also kinda implies that you are always inviting the participation of at least one other player into that creation process.<br/><br/>Since we tend to play in groups, that is probably a major benefit right there.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_326261">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326261/#Comment_326261" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T00:10:45+00:00" title="May 25, 2011 12:10AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: komradebob</cite>There may be one really simple thing that folks are missing that the Czege Principle does at least point at side-ways.<br/><br/>If you don't both create and resolve your own adversity, it kinda implies that someone else does do one of those two things.<br/><br/>Which also kinda implies that you are always inviting the participation of at least one other player into that creation process.<br/><br/>Since we tend to play in groups, that is probably a major benefit right there.</blockquote>Yes.

You don't want the experienced players thinking your game is like "Candyland" (ie no input from the players at all) so they are turned off - or like improve theater which will turn off audience players. <br/><br/>So while too much freedom can kill games. It is too simple an explanation. The "why" is different for different people. <br/><br/>I followed the link to Vincent Baker's blog on dreck from the common culture defaulting as the matrix we build from (if there is not enough interesting background information). One point he made that I found very interesting was that he finds that if there is only one resolutions mechanic (and it is too abstract) that a world destroying witch fighting the good guys is resolved the same way as two farmers disputing over the ownership of a cart of vegitables. It didn't give a sense of importance. He cited "In a wicked age" as doing this. This concerns me because I use one resolution mechanic. People do have to say how they do things so it is maybe not as abstract as "I have a bigger number!" methods, but words are pretty abstract (by definition).<br/><br/>I'll have to think about if I have enough human interaction vs masturbatory monologs. <br/><br/>I'm playing with the idea that the games are built around the idea of counting coup on oneanother as a way to foster interaction.

If a conflict is well set up, having the players engage in it, then it will be of importance which way the die rolls. It may be a single die each and every time, in a simple conflict resolution (roll higher or fail), and still it may give a sense of importance. The crucial point is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how engaged the players are</span>.

The reason that thye're a Big Fucking Deal is that they vastly, vastly improve wargames. Like, a Quantum Leap Forward Level of improving wargames, and they do it really simply.<br/><br/>Well, at least I think they do. And it seems at least a small devoted audience of wargamers agree.<br/><br/>Wargames are built for a relatively constrained level of action. It doesn't matter what game you've encountered, whether some kindtoy soldier tabltop game or a board game like Risk, Axis&amp;Allies, or an old hex'n'chit type game, this will hold true. Within that scale that it's designed for, it will allow a certain amount of randomness.<br/><br/>Now, sometimes, those games will attempt to address out-of-scale events. They tend to do it really horribly. Often their solutions are clunky, rarely used, ill-defined, and very open to misintepretation of intent, willful or otherwise. You'll especially tend to find this stuff in old SPI and Avalon Hill board wargames and sometimes in older historical miniatures wargames that attempt to cover an entire war or period of warfare.<br/><br/>The thing is, those out-of-scale-for-Game-X mechanics in wargames are there for a reason. Wargamer geeks are also likely to read the hell up on whatever period they're into and learn all sorts of bitty details that tend to affect things.<br/><br/>They're also likely to read up on specific battles and understand how the Butterfly Effect of events outside of the scale of the actual clash of arms in a given battle or campaign ( be it larger scale of politics, industry, cultural attitudes or related far away battles or a smaller scale of tactical advantages, bad maps, or personality clashes of leading officers) decidely impacted that wartime event.<br/><br/>And they want that stuff in their game, because that kind of chaos, that For Want of a Nail Butterfly Effect, is interesting as hell. And challenging to deal with.<br/><br/>MG mechanical concepts reduce all of those older attempts to get that stuff into a wargame to a really simple roll off. More than that, they allow the active participants to, at the moment of interest or conception of a Butterfly Effect initiating event, to attempt to work that into the ongoing game and see if that Butterfly Effect is created at all, and also follow it along to see the impact and where it might go to or how little it might actually matter.<br/><br/>In this, it is very much like a lot of Narrativist games. It has a chance for something someone came up with Right Now! to impact later events in a way we didn't expect at the start of play.<br/><br/>And, as with Narr-y kinds of play techniques, there was an evolutionary moment when someone thought, hey, y'know what? We could probably not just use this as an add-on to a system or an informal play-technique, we could really make this thing the core of the game and dump the other cruft, becaus ethis stuff is the stuff that's really getting us fired up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326352">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326352/#Comment_326352" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T13:05:49+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  1:05PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bob's description is pretty accurate for the origin of Matrix games but I've bee trying to move beyond that to use the mechanic to do non-military stuff.

Maybe another thread? I think Tomas would be down for that.<br/><br/>Going back to the original discussion point, have you really specifically told them what to make up at each step? Have you given other players guidelines on when and how and why to interrupt and call for a roll? Is there a very clear goal overall/end state for the game?<br/><br/>Edit: BTW, I scribbled down a no-GM hack for EMG rolls once. It was a sort of 20/20 Hindsight rule. It had a single player rolling two dice of different colors when a roll would be called for. One die was the difficulty die, the other die was for their success. Both are rolled at the same time. The player needed to meet or beat the difficulty die roll result with their other die.<br/><br/>Totally random, right? Possibly worse than putting the difficulty to a biased, human, no? Except that it was part of the fun/challenge to explain the result after the fact. I didn't go too deep into the thing, but it changed part of where the fun of the game lies. Right now, a lot of your mechanic revolves around a certain amount of understanding between the player and whoever is calling the difficulty, for good or ill, regardless of the game's subject matter.<br/><br/>Feasibly, this could create a different sort of MG interaction, with the group then brainstorming/pattern recognizing/justifying in fiction what is largely a random result.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326362">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin" title="Ryan_Macklin"><img alt="Ryan_Macklin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://RyanMacklin.com/wp-content/themes/macklin2/images/sg-icon.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ryan_Macklin">Ryan_Macklin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326362/#Comment_326362" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T13:36:39+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  1:36PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2011 1:40PM by Ryan_Macklin.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: TomasHVM</cite><cite>Posted By: Jim Crocker</cite>"The Czege Principle says that when one person is the author of both the character's adversity and its resolution, play isn't fun"</blockquote>I beg to differ on that "principle"; it is false.

And I suspect folks who do enjoy doing that for themselves are the sort of people I wouldn't care to play with or design games for.<br/><br/>- Ryan                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326369">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326369/#Comment_326369" name="Item_48" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T13:57:31+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  1:57PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Play where only one player is babbling on without the input of other players being involved, <b>and</b> having that babbling structurally forced on the other players is deathly bad, yes.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_326384">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326384/#Comment_326384" name="Item_49" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T15:39:18+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  3:39PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited May 25, 2011 3:43PM by TomasHVM.">edited May 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ryan Macklin</cite>When one person is the author of both a character's adversity and its resolution, it's <em>boring as shit</em> for everyone else.</blockquote>What's with the language?<br/><br/>You're saying this as if it was a universal truth; and that is how I read this "principle" too; as something we cannot avoid, if we let the player handle the beginning and end of a character-conflict.<br/><br/>But I know that we can do this and have great fun with it. I've seen it done in traditional games, when normal players none of us would object to playing with, get bored with the system and leave it behind, and make their own "freeform rules". I've seen it done in games, as part of the game-method, and done well. <br/><br/>So, why does it work in some games?<br/>- I believe it has to do with <b>the time-frame</b>; faster game methods let you do a lot of things that slower game methods never can do. So when a player get to narrate both the conflict and the resolution, we accept it, if it brings the game forward without delay.<br/>- And I believe it has to do with <b>the mind-frame</b>; players geared towards participation in every part of the game, even the parts where other players own the scenes (as listening audience), will not only tolerate the narration of another players quirks, but find it interesting. <br/><br/>I do not say that we should do it all the time, or that it is a preferred modus operandi for me. It is not. But it is a simple fact that when this is possible, as part of constructive gameplay, then your statement rings false, Ryan. The "principle" of Vincent is not a principle, but an observation subject to certain conditions; without the conditions, or the specific context, it is little more than a flimsy opinion. <br/><br/>I see no need for us to keep such "principles"; let them be reduced to the observation they are; with the context playing a mayor part in what they refer to. And let us keep the possibility of playing our games like this. It gives us a more open playing field both as players and as designers.<br/><br/>That's it from me for now.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_326411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/stefoid" title="stefoid"><img alt="stefoid" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.woof.net.au/forum/image.php?u=1233&amp;dateline=1259919024"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/stefoid">stefoid</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326411/#Comment_326411" name="Item_50" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-25T20:13:20+00:00" title="May 25, 2011  8:13PM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: MatrixGamer</cite>I came across a blog entry yesterday on Engle Matrix games. It was a person who says they've had a love/hate relationship with the idea for ten years. They always come back to it but then reject it. The reason was simple.<br/><br/>Too much freedom of action quickly dries up the well of creativitiy and quickly gets repetitive or esculates into sillyness.<br/><br/>I'm the Engle of EMGs and I hate to say it but I've seen the same problem. Heck I don't want to make up stuff all the time. Making up stuff seems like it should be easy but it isn't. I'm working on ways to give players a steady stream of outside input to keep games working but that is ducking the issue.<br/><br/>What is it about freedom that is so difficult?<br/><br/>One thing has to be the Czege Principle - where making up your own conflict is unsatisfying.<br/><br/>I can also see that our brains are good at pattern recognition but maybe no pattern creation.<br/><br/>Chris Engle</blockquote>\nThis post has been very topical for me, thanks.<br/><br/>Right now, Im struggling with scenario or 'module' creation and I realize that its the freedom I have been struggling with.  Specifically the scope of the initial situation and goals of the characters.  I have been having blank page syndrome because, I think, Ive been sub-consciously setting my sights on grand-scale situation and grand-scale goals for characters.  You know, I want this to rawk, I want it to be epic!  And I realize that fiction usually dosnt work that way.  You cant start epic, and even if I did manage to think of an initial situation and character goals that were epic, the GM and players would struggle with it also.<br/><br/>So yeah, restraints.  Restrict the initial scale is what Im now thinking, and its starting to flow easier.  Make it start ff on a personal-scale, and let any epicness play out in  time rather than try to design it in from the start.  This should make it a lot easier for players and GM to pick up and run with too.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><!DOCTYPE html>\n\n<html

Seed content is very important. In my gaming circles, we've been talking about "the third narrator" - there's the player, (sometimes) the game master, and then there's the <i>fictional content coming from the system</i>.<br/><br/>A few examples:<br/>- Wandering monster tables (ah, okay, we've got five Troglodytes on our hands, let's see...)<br/>- The scene cards in Fuck Youth (oh, okay, this scene is about getting drunk, let's see...)<br/>- Fate cards in Archipelago (so, right, your character is getting hosed by something in the geography around her, let me think...)<br/>- Oracles, oracles, oracles<br/>- Rolling for your Holding at the start of an AW session (right, so suddenly there's scarcity and your gang goes crazy from lack of drugs, let's see what happens now...)<br/><br/>So Chris, I'd suggest trying out a random event mechanic or something.

It was some of the best fun I've ever had, there wasn't all that much structure beyond the bidding mechanics. What was neat is playing it through the first time you don't know what the end goals are.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_326438">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/326438/#Comment_326438" name="Item_54" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-05-26T05:51:09+00:00" title="May 26, 2011  5:51AM">May 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "So Chris, I'd suggest trying out a random event mechanic or something.

It has no concrete detail so its universally applicable.  eg: "<i>you cant handle the truth...</i>"  or  "<i>betrayal!</i>"   Like Graham says "do the obvious thing", but when you have the option to do something obvious with respect to a randomly generated story seed, what is obvious now <i>wasnt </i>obvious before you rolled for the seed.  you get a surprise that is obvious in retrospect, which is great.  Although sometimes you also get a 'wtf?'  but these can turn out to be good too, after some stewing.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328199">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks" title="Colin_Fredericks"><img alt="Colin_Fredericks" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.valentgames.com/graphics/bronto32.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Colin_Fredericks">Colin_Fredericks</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328199/#Comment_328199" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-07T09:32:23+00:00" title="June  7, 2011  9:32AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Weeks after this conversation has ended, I finally discovered something that makes a contribution to it:<br/><br/><a href="http://catandgirl.com/?p=1387" rel="nofollow">http://catandgirl.com/?p=1387</a><br/><br/><img alt="image" src="http://catandgirl.com/archive/2002-03-25-cg0091movies.gif"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328414">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328414/#Comment_328414" name="Item_57" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-08T05:09:58+00:00" title="June  8, 2011  5:09AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I love this cartoon.
