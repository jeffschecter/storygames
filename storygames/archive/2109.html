                    So, we're going to start an old-school game using Artesia in january and the GM already told us we the adventure would start when we return from the Tournament of Flowers in Newgate visiting the equivalent of a 'Known World Biker Bar'.<br/><br/>I am intrigued by the idea, but I want to know - what would you do as GMs and/or Players to make this scene awesome instead of same-old, same-old?                </div>

                            Probably not quite what you are after, but...<br/>
<br/>
For a retro-style campaign that never got off the ground, I looked at the base concept of "You are sitting at the inn when the merchant comes running in shouting about orcs" followed by the characters tracking the orcs to the dungeon.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, clearly here the merchant and the trip to the dungeon is just unecessary fluff sooo... snip goes the scissors.<br/>
<br/>
Game starts; the characters are sitting at the inn drinking their last copper's worths... when the inn floor collapses, revealing below the long-forgotten dungeon it happened to be built on top of. :-)                        </div>

                            how about someone bursts through the doors of the inn, madly rushes up to the most responsive looking player, pleading for help that abruptly ends during a horrible fit of coughing, giving the nearest player character some kind of crazy illness.   then have the npc die visibly in horrible pain saying something cryptic.  <br/><br/>do i have zombies on the brain a bit too much?<br/>-nate                        </div>

                            In one adventure (post apocalypse) the PCs were sitting in a bar, and the players knew that the Shadowy Figure was gonna step out any time now with a map, some gold pieces and The Adventure.<br/><br/>Instead, there was a commotion right outside, with lots of screaming and the like. The PCs went outside to see a priestess (in this setting the priestesses were also bureaucrats, police, city administration, police, etc) staggering bleary-eyed past the tavern sporting massive wounds all over her body, and soon collapsed. The PCs (well, two of them) of course rush up to her. She points to the wilderness, says "Thunder Plain", and dies.<br/><br/>It was a setup for an adventure: Thunder Plain was the name of an uncovered vault/fallout shelter (read: "Post apoc dungeon") days away (they had to research to find out what it was, where, etc), and of course the PCs were the first ones to jump at the opportunity to explore that vault.<br/><br/>Shake it up a bit. Have the tavern explode.                        </div>

                            Make them watch the Stranger pick another group of Adventurers after looking them over.<br/><br/>Then fast forward. The party never returns, and the Stranger is being assaulted for "having interfered in what he/she ought not to have".<br/><br/>They'll be ripping the info out of the Stranger and you'll be able to give cool clues to deadly traps by looking at the corpses.

                            If it's a biker thing, it really needs to start with a fight (as in, an actual combat, not a narrated event). Two rival gangs. Whichever side they ally themselves with can give them the mission. If they don't ally themselves with either side, both sides can give them the same mission: "Hey, you, you want a job? There's this place we need someone to take a look at."<br/><br/>Graham                        </div>

                            All hooks there guys. No "grabs." How you Awesomeofie the traditional bar scene is to actually make it pertinent to the characters in question. Let's say we've got one character who has defined relationships to a lover, and a political ally. You simply have them both show up...together. Another character is a holy warrior and there are some folks in the corner bad-mouthing his diety. But it's a holy day of peace! Another character is defined as quite greedy, but also compassionate about the poor. He finds a pouch dropped by a merchant, and two orphans who have snuck into the bar trying to find something to eat. Another character is a wizard who loves discovering new spells, but also has a bad drug addiction. He's got ten sheckels to spend, and that's what both his dealer wants, and the guy in the corner wants for his musty old book.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here's the fun part, mix them up. The Lover is the one badmouthing the diety. The political ally is the one who dropped the purse. The "orphans" turn out to belong to the drug dealer. And the guy with the musty old book is the brother of the lover.<br/>
<br/>
Don't use the above example! It's made for hypothetical characters. Take the characters you have, and make up an example that works off of what's important to the player about those characters.<br/>
<br/>
The reason the orc tracks to the dungeon is such a groaner is not because it's cliche. All of my examples are cliche, too. Cliche is fine. It's a groaner because it's the same old non-interesting hook that was used last time. Instead grab the players by the throat with situations that immediately involve the stuff that makes the character interesting to the player. So, actually, if the characters are all orc warriors, then perhaps orc tracks to the dungeon is precisely what's called for.<br/>
<br/>
It all depends on the characters. Any situation made up without reference to the chracters in question is simply not as awesome as one that is.<br/>

                            For my suggestion, I assume generally heroic PCs, who won a few challenges at the tournament, which involves some fighting. Also assume they have somewhere to be later on.

                            Personally, I always thought Mysterious Strangers with suspect job offers were pointed in the direction of the adventurers because the Barman was hoping the lazy, non-tab paying, furniture breaking, brawling heathens that frequented his place would either come back rich and make up for it all, or they'd die and he could turn the joint into the nice, cozy, community pub he'd hoped for when he opened.<br><br>Come to think of it, maybe the whole thing is a con job, and the Mysterious Stranger is actually the barman's cousin from the next town over, with the barman desperately hoping the  pcs all get themselves killed, hence the direction to the nearest orc and gelatinous cube infested tunnel complex.                        </br></br></div>

                            Tony, not to pick on you, but my response to this set up in my head would be like:<br/>
<br/>
"Eh. Neat color. But what does it have to do with my character? Maybe I'll just have my guy slip out the back...but then there's no scenario to play through...guess I'll just have to play along and have my character ask somebody about what the Staff of Ra is."<br/>
<br/>
See you're not leaving any real choices for the player here. Unless, of course, the characters have allegiances to both of these gangs or members of it or somthing.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I'm saying: plot is dead easy to create. It's like some sort of comedy sportz routine: X comes into a bar and has Y problem. X says, can you help me with it? Filling in the blanks takes very little effort. But just isn't engaging until there's some real input for the player to make.<br/>
<br/>
If, in fact, the bar set up exists to get characters to something more interesting, do it in Media Res:<br/>
<br/>
"After a fight in a tavern in which the Deathskulls and Knifebrains had it out over something called the Staff of Ra, you all decided to check out a place called the Temple of Aremis. So now you stand before it considering breaking into it, but one of you notes that there's a symbol on the door that indicates that it's associated with the death cult you guys are involved with. What do you do?"<br/>
<br/>
Basicall skip any scene where asking "What do you do?" only has one viable answer. Even if there's lots of ways to implement it. Sure, in your scene one could approach getting the information by violence, or by trickery, or by persuasion. That's got a modicum of interest as a decision, especially if not established previously for these characters. You might get away with it as an establishing scene this way. But better if there are actually two or more interesting directions that the players can choose to go entirely.<br/>
<br/>
It's akin to those linear tournament dungeons that only have corridors from encounters numbered 1 to 20. Yeah, the GM asks, "Where do you go now?" but there's really only one answer. Answering it is perfunctory, and not really interesting. The interesting part is what happens in the next room.<br/>
<br/>
Always be framing to the places where the players have the ability to affect the play. Simple as that (not that it's easy to do, just that it's not hard to understand).<br/>

                            Mike is bang-on. The game needs to apply to the specific characters in some way that's moderately intimate to them (and appealing to the specific players as well). Ideally it applies to things they've said they care about or have designed characters around.<br><br>Great hooks become awesome hooks when they are character specific!<br><br>-Marco                        </br></br></br></br></div>

                            If this is a biker bar, it's not really that likely that someone is going to come up to you and say "Hey, I've got a dangerous quest..." etc and so on. It's far more likely he'll say "You spilled my pint you git!" and haul off with a length of chain, or at least say "yore my besht (hic) my besht fren', didja, didja know dat my beshtesht ever freninda wooooooorl'" shortly before collapsing in a heap of vomit on the floor.<br><br>I despise 'tavern starts' myself, even in fantasy games, so I would likely never choose to do the old "There is a job posting on the notice board" jobby. Let's see, how could we make this interesting...<br><br>How about, a stranger walks up to you in a bar and says "hey, Frank old buddy, how are you doing? Let me buy you a drink!" Apparently he's mistaken you for a friend of his, but he seems sober enough and utterly convinced that you're this Frank guy. Is it just a coincidence that you have a double somewhere, or is there some more unusual explanation in store? Now that's one adventure seed that could go in a zillion different directions, from doppelganger ghosts to a simple case of mistaken identity (and all the trouble that can entail) to time-travelling back into the past in an attempt to change history, crossing your own timeline in the process.<br><br>Ash                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

                            How 'bout...<br><br>The bar is yours -- you're the owner(s). You fancy yourself the secret facilitator and groomer of adventurer types. The game essentially boils down to resource management, as you put hero parties in touch with the correct opportunities, and who will hopefully return alive with much coin to spend at your establishment. All sorts of colorful fantasy characters can put in brief appearances, making life unpredictable. Also, it's up to you do discourage those infamous bar fights from breaking out, because they're expensive.                        </br></br></div>

                            Thanks guys. So far, Artesia-specific, Mike's idea of peppering the audience with related npcs is the best and easiest way to go, since the life path character generation provides a lot of relationships to exploit in this manner. I'll surely post an AP report somewhere. Of course, that's because Mike is the one with the great ideas, we just happen to have a system that supports this out-of-the-book.<br><br>Now, for ideas how the players can spice up the whole thing? Larry's idea of being the bar owners is quite fun, but does not fit the old-school label at first sight. Would make for a nice PTA pitch, though..                        </br></br></div>

                            I tried to awesomify this as a player recently, and it didn't work, I think because of agenda clashes.  It was in a session of a game that has the PCs as ancient Greek demi-gods.  My PC (buff warrior hero of epic quests) wanted some hired muscle to follow him on a somewhat crazy mission, so I said he'd go to a bar, and when a stranger who looked like he could handle himself in a fight approached him, he'd start a fight over a silly misunderstanding that would enevitably (I thought, given the genre I thought we were playing) end in them swearing blood brotherhood to each other and the stranger in question following my hero to the ends of the earth and back again on his quest for the Platinum Whatshamacallit of Some Virtue.  I thought this would be damn cool, and totally in keeping with the style of the game, but everyone looked at me like I'd grown an extra head.  I don't know how that could translate to bikers, but it may inspire ideas.<br><br>Claire                        </br></br></div>

Y'know, it's amazing how often someone you just beat the living snot out of <i>doesn't </i>decide that he likes and respects you when the blood's all been mopped up. Most of the time they prefer to become, like, your mortal enemy or something. Some people eh?

                            I think there's some confusion about the tavern in question. Artesia is a fantasy world, and he's saying that the tavern in question is the *equivalent* of a biker bar. He's making an analogy. So in this case, perhaps the the tavern is actually frequented by gangs of horsemen who are known to likely have turned to highway robbery at times, but none of it provable. Or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
Not an actual biker bar sitting next to the temple to Thoth.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On Artesia I seem to recall that the mechanics in question are one of the reasons that the system is really deserving of the Origins Award it got.<br/>

Players can share a road as long as one get's the road going in one direction and the other get's the road going in another.<br><br>2) Each player says what is rumored to be at the end of each road, this can be changed to better suit what each player contributes and compliment each other. If someone has no ideas, they go last in order to benefit from other's vibe. If someone has strong ideas, they go first.<br/><br/>If there's a fight about who goes first, settle it with dice (or knives, whichever is closer at hand).<br/><br/>3) Make characters rooted in the world created by the crossroads and rumors of what lays beyond.<br/></br></br></br></blockquote>
1) The 'Known World' has some big cities, which you know, have lots of roads. And inns. The GM can just do the inn, the roads leading to the inn are derived from the backgrounds established during character creation. <br/><br/>2) Although there is general information available about the Known World, most of it is broad enough that the rumors can be either smaller scale or just tie into what's known about a place historically. In fact, a pre-existing world might help in this part.<br/><br/>3) This has already happened in Part 0 (character creation) and part 2 of the process. <br/><br/><br/>Anything amiss?                        </br></br></div>

                            My first urge at seeing this subject title was to mash it together with Dark City -- specifically the first few moments of the protagonist's waking.  You're sitting at a table, in a bar.  This guy comes towards you, all insistent with dire need and purpose.  And you're thinking ... hang on a second.  Why am I here?  Who am I, and who is this guy?  Wait a second: this sounds like some pretty dangerous and dire circumstances he's talking about.  And they're about *me*.  But I don't recognize myself in anything he's saying.  Maybe if I play along, I'll start to figure out what's happened to me and why the world -- and my own identity -- are a mystery to me.<br/><br/>I dunno.  Maybe it's just a kicker-vision of where I'd go with the basic set-up.  I think on some level my urge here is to reduce "knowledge" to the point where the guy walking into the bar with a mission for me is the only real, concrete, graspable thing I (as my character) can cling to, in desperation and fear.                        </div>

I dig, Shreyas and I understand and agree with what you are saying that what I said wasn't going to work could very well work and work well.<br/><br/>It doesn't jibe with the effect that I have seen very developed settings have on the table.  There are creative constraints that focus the creativity into a powerful force and there is a setting that is what I consider over-cooked that forces the GM who wants to stick to the text to say, "No," all too often if the foundation groundwork isn't laid down very well or everyone isn't bought in and read up on the setting's many details.<br/><br/>But I hear ya and I see how it could work.  Thanks.                        </div>

<p>Oh yeah, absolutely. I think basically anyone who's used someone else's setting, myself included, has been guilty of this at least once. It's a pitfall that's very tempting and it seems to take a little bit of learning and self-consciousness to avoid turning those constraints that are so powerful into straitjackets that are fatal.</p>

                            Posted By: oliofI am intrigued by the idea, but I want to know - what would you do as GMs and/or Players to make this scene awesome instead of same-old, same-old?<br/>
<br/>
In my experience what Mike Holes suggested is a great bit of advice. I've played in and observed games where, even after spending a long time and lots of energy making characters for the world in question, we would move right into the stupid bar opening. And it would suck butt. <br/>
<br/>
All the anticipation and nervous (good) energy about the game would be dispersed with a loud *thud* as we all realized that the person running the game had opened this canned scene, inserting our names into the appropriate slots. I realized that it made no difference what I was bringing to the game. Just about everthing I had written down on my sheet, incuding the rediculous paragraphs of back story, would be ignored. <br/>
<br/>
I would only amend Mike's advice by saying: focus on looking at elements pertinent/interesting/important/grabby to the players (contrasted with things pertinent to the characters).                        </div>
