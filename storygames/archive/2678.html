Followed by:<br/><br/>    * Troll Lands (7.8)<br/>    * Once More (6.8)<br/>    * In Inordinate Fondness &amp; Dark Explorations (6)<br/>    * Friends or Fortune &amp; In Frankensteins Wake (5)<br/><br/>Most Playable: In Frankenstein's Wake, by Eric Boyd, with a total average score in the category of 8.5/10.

As a game cannot take more than one title, the next highest was a three-way tie! The City at the Edge of Sleep, An Inordinate Fondness and Once More all received a score of 7. As City at the Edge of Sleep is also ineligible, the official winners of this category are both An Inordinate Fondness, by Mark Villianatos and Once More, by Mendel Schmiedekamp! The other scores:<br/><br/>    * Troll Lands (5.6)<br/>    * Friends or Fortune (5.5)<br/>    * Dark Explorations (5)<br/><br/>Congratulations to Mike, Eric, Mark and Mendel! I look forward to playing your games!<br/><br/>--- <br/><br/>Feel free to use this thread to talk about/reflect on the contest and the games and such. I feel like this is a better place for that kind of thing than the blog.<br/><br/>Let me just say that I'm really pleased with how everything turned out, and I am honestly really excited to play the winning games!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God" title="Thunder_God"><img alt="Thunder_God" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i30.photobucket.com/albums/c320/tundranocaps/John32.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Thunder_God">Thunder_God</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61411/#Comment_61411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-17T21:10:24+00:00" title="March 17, 2007  9:10PM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            So close to the Best Incorporation of Artwork, so close <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>I thought it was an interesting contest, and I got what I needed out of it, a complete game-core.<br/><br/>As always, my writing could seriously need some work on the clarity front (ouch, 4.6).

I really hope you do it again as the BibliOdyssey blog is great and the contest concept provides constraints very different from others. Congrats to the other winners. I really enjoyed reading the other games and hope they'll see further development. I think it's great that we had several games that were embracing short-form play and employing board game elements. <br/><br/>As for my game, I definitely plan to develop it further, and I really appreciate the feedback on it. <br/><br/>Nathan, did anything surprise you about the games emerging from the contest? Is there anything you would do different next time?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_61416">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver" title="Dave Cleaver"><img alt="Dave Cleaver" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://dscleaver.googlepages.com/avatar_small.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Dave%20Cleaver">Dave Cleaver</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/61416/#Comment_61416" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2007-03-18T04:45:09+00:00" title="March 18, 2007  4:45AM">March 2007</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for a great contest Nathan.
