It's this coming weekend, July 21st and 22nd, and should be a good bit of fun.<br/><br/><a href="http://lansingboardgamers.com/home/GGW" rel="nofollow">Gamers Gone Wild</a><br/><br/>I'm currently rearranging my work schedule to make sure I get in a good solid day for this, not sure which day it'll be. Let me know if you're in the area and are planning to attend.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
