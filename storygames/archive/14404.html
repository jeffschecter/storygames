Lady Raven made it, but was killed when someone took it and the sword-making skill was lost forever! You need a dice of the amount of people playing. 4? Use a d4. D20? You gotta find twenty people. This number must match. Everyone has a name that matches a number on the die. Three-Roses, Count-of-Sevens, etc. <br/><br/>Who has the One-Sword? Well, One-Sword does. That's a player and that player must play One-Sword. That character also killed Lady Raven!<br/><br/>Roll the die to see who plays what, until the leftovers are obvious. Then One-Sword's player rolls the die. Whatever number comes up goes to that player. That player gets the die and narrates what their character does and says what they say. The catch is they only get to say 3 sentences! Then they roll the die and whatever number comes up is who gets to narrate next. If you do something involving another character, that character gets 3 sentences next instead. If One is rolled, One-Sword narrates in three sentences how they show up and kill you. Then One-Sword's character rolls the die to keep it going. If One-Sword rolls a One, One-Sword is the ruler of the land and wins. If someone rolls a dead number, then that dead player becomes the new One-Sword who uses 3 sentences to say how a new character takes the sword. The old One-Sword player doesn't get to play anymore and has to be quiet now.

Regular setup with players and a GM.<br/><br/>Everyone starts out with a certain number of beads (lets say 50, but might get changed according to playtesting). The GM sets the scenario, and produces challenges, with the ability to set difficulties at a certain number of beads. The players decide if the cost is worth succeeding at that particular thing, or failing and progressing down a different path. Naturally the system assumes only challenges for which both success and failure are interesting.<br/><br/>At the end, there's a final encounter with the big bad. The GM no longer gets to set difficulties, and instead can make use of the beads that the players used to get this far. Everyone finds a good way to conceal the beads they'll be playing, because it's a case of whoever bids more on a particular action (either carrying it out or countering it) wins. Death is possible at this point, even before all the beads are used up, as long as the described action could reasonably cause it ("I unload a full clip from my SMG at the mad scientist" would kill him unless the GM spends enough beads to dodge), so there's an incentive not to be stingy.<br/><br/>I haven't been keeping track of time, but I think I'm probably close to the 5 minutes, so I think I'm done.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327316">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/wothbora" title="wothbora"><img alt="wothbora" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/wothbora">wothbora</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327316/#Comment_327316" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-01T11:24:00+00:00" title="June  1, 2011 11:24AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 1, 2011 11:27AM by wothbora.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Okay, it took half an hour (lunch break), but here's the first game I've ever done...<br/>Please, be gentle with me...<br/><br/><b>~~~Let's Kick Donny's Ass~~~~<br/>```But Not Kill Him```</b><br/><br/><i><b>Lori <br/></b></i><br/><i>In grade school there was this tiny girl, her skin looked bleached. Her hair was black, shiny. She always wore homemade dresses, dark and plaid. She never talked, she just whispered.  Lori coughed a lot, it sounded thick, too large for her small chest. Donny was a bully, one time he caught a stray dog, he held that dog by the tail and spun as fast as he could. The dog whined and cried. Donny laughed. One day it was raining, Miss Wren was gone to get milk for our class. Donny poured glue all over the seat of his chair. We all laughed because he covered the whole seat. His brown eyes were crazy. Lori stood next to me. She was shaking and she coughed, deep. Donny grabbed Lori and jerked her over to the chair. I was still laughing at glue dripping off the seat. Donny shoved her down, her dress sliding into the glue and then rising up. Glue covered her dress and pushed up between her skinny legs. Donny laughed. The class laughed. Lori looked into my eyes. Donny held her down, glue ran down her legs, it dripped on the gray tile. I just stood there, watching. </i><br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>Donny\u2019s a rotten kid. He\u2019s a bully that everyone hates, but everyone is too afraid to fight because he is so darn tough. He\u2019s mean, ugly, and hurts everything he sees.<br/><br/>Today is different. You and your friends have decided to draw the line. This is where it ends. Alone you can do nothing... together? Well, together you\u2019re gonna kick his ass!<br/><br/>There\u2019s a problem though... Donny won\u2019t go down without a fight. In fact, he won\u2019t stop until he is unconscious or dead. This leaves you and your friends in a dilemma. How can you hurt Donny enough to teach him a lesson and not cross the line and make him dead? Even though you, your friends, and everybody you know wants him dead?<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/><b>Setup:</b><br/>Answer these questions:<br/>\u2022\tWhat\u2019s your name?<br/>\u2022\tAre you a boy or a girl? (this doesn\u2019t even matter when it comes to Donny)<br/>\u2022\tHow old are you?<br/>\u2022\tWhat has Donny done to you that makes you so mad?<br/>\u2022\tWhat would you like to do to Donny to teach him a lesson?<br/>\u2022\tWhat is the most secretest secret you have that you don\u2019t want anyone to find out about?<br/><br/>There are <b>Three Things Every Kid Has: Head, Hands, and Heart</b>. Your Head is how smart you are (some kids can think up good plans while others just run from one moment to the next). Your Hands are everything that you can do with your body (from hitting, scratching, running, bashing, etc.). Your Heart is how you feel (happy, sad, hurt, cold, angry, scared, to screaming and saying swears, etc.).<br/><br/>Depending on how old you are, you get to add a point to Head, Hand, or Heart for each year. Roll a \u201cten sided die\u201d and divide by two (round down even if it is zero [because some kids really suck at everything]), you get to add these points to whichever thing about you that you like.<br/><br/><br/><b>The Breaking Point:</b><br/>Every kid also has a breaking point. Depending on the kid it could be any of the Three Things Every Kid Has. Whichever of the Three Things Every Kid Has has the highest number is what that kid is (smarts, body, or emotions). This is the breaking point and is represented by multiply by two). Example: Jayne has a Heart of 6 so her breaking point is 12, while Kyle has Hands of 5 so his breaking point is 10. Even if someone hit Jayne with a rock and hurt her, she wouldn\u2019t \u201cbreak\u201d until her Heart rating hit zero. If someone called Kyle names and really hurt his feelings, he wouldn\u2019t hit his breaking point until his Hands rating lowered to zero. <br/><br/>Anything beyond a -3 causes permanent damage (even if it is not one\u2019s personal breaking point). Example. Kyle has Hands of 5 and a Heart of 2. Vincent remembers that when Kyle slept over in Kindergarten he pee\u2019d his sleeping bag. While in the bathroom, during recess Vincent attacks Kyle, <br/><i><br/>\u201cKyle, Kyle, Kyle...<br/>What\u2019s the reason you smile?<br/>Not cause your better,<br/>\u2018Cause you\u2019re a big fat baby <br/>Bed Wetter!\u201d</i><br/><br/>When Vincent rolls for damage (see below for actual conflict resolution) he accomplishes 6 points of damage which drops Kyle to -4. Kyle is crushed and will probably keep the \u201cBed Wetter\u201d nickname until he\u2019s in Middle School, but Vincent is about to find out what Kyle\u2019s Hands of 5 will do to his Hands of 2 when Kyle opens up his bag of whoop-ass.<br/><b><br/>Conflict:</b><br/>How do you do stuff? If it involves being smart use your Head, if it involves doing something use your Hands, and if it involves your Feelings use your Heart. <br/><br/>Either use a d10 or playing cards without the face cards. <br/>\u2022\tIf you are attacking you want to roll higher than your enemy\u2019s Head, Hands and Heart.<br/>\u2022\tWhen you are defending you want to roll lower than your Head, Hands, or Heart. <br/>That\u2019s all there is to it... Roll lower than your Three H\u2019s if you are doing something and roll higher if you are trying to stop something. <br/><br/><b>Damage: </b><br/>Fists, Words, Feelings -- These all do the difference in the roll of a dice. You need to roll higher than 5 and roll a 9, then it\u2019s 4 points of damage... If you are defending yourself the same applies. You need to roll lower than 6 and roll a 1, then you\u2019ve received no damage.<br/><br/><b>Hands:</b><br/>\u2022\tHeavy Sticks, Switches, Snow Balls, Dirt Clods -- These all do the difference in the roll of a dice AND 1 additional point of damage.<br/>\u2022\tRocks, Baseball Bats, Clubs, Base Balls, etc -- These all do the difference in the roll of a dice AND 2 additional points.<br/>\u2022\tBB-Guns, Paint Ball Guns, Sling Shots, etc -- These all do the difference in the roll of a dice AND 2 additional points.<br/><b>Head: </b>Use the above to make your own grid of damage.<br/><b>Heart: </b>Use the above to make your own grid of damage.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/><b>Sample Kid:</b><br/>My name is John. My friends call me Johnny, but Donny calls Butt Sniffer and Poop Hole Licker. I\u2019m six and a half years old and have a little brother (Jeff) who will start school next year. I\u2019m worried that Donny will hurt Jeffy and I won\u2019t be able to protect him. I\u2019d really like to make Donny cry. He\u2019s made me cry so many times that I can\u2019t count them all. I would really like to kick him in his Poop Hole and tell him to go have his mom lick it (that\u2019s what he did to me after Halloween). My most secret thing is my pocket knife. My dad gave it to me and said that he got it from some Swiss Army Guy. I sneak it to school and don\u2019t show it to anyone, not even my best-est friend Shane. Well, really, I carry it around all the time because I think I might use it someday to help protect me from Donny.<br/><br/>[John rolled a 6 so he gets 3 points to add to his Three Things Every Kid Has]<br/>Before:<br/>Head -- 2<br/>Hands -- 3<br/>Heart -- 1<br/><br/>After:<br/>Head -- 2<br/>Hands -- 5 <br/>Heart -- 2 <br/><br/>Breaking Point: Hands -- 10<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/>The object of the game is to lure Donny to a location where you can all team up and beat the crap out of him without actually killing him. You\u2019ll need smart kids, kids with feelings as tough as elephant skin, and you will definitely need tough kids who can rip Donny up together. <br/><br/>Below is Donny... Have fun, but don\u2019t cross the line and have your parents, your teachers, or the law come looking for you if you go too far.... Break his spirit, freak out his mind, kick his ass, but don\u2019t kill him. Whatever you do, don\u2019t kill him.<br/><br/>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/><br/><br/>My name is Donny. My dad sucks the big one and my mom hates me. I can\u2019t ever do anything right and it pisses me off. I think the only good things in life come from taking them. I take whatever I want since all the grownups I know take everything I ever liked. I\u2019m in third grade, but I should\u2019ve been in grade four. That damn Ms. Nelson sucks the big one (just like my dad). It is kind of nice though being in third grade. Lots and lots of little kids to push around, eat their desert, and make \u2018em do stuff for me. When I grow up I think I want to be a cop. They get to push everybody around. I think I\u2019d like to have a badge and push my dad around...

You can only red-herring out the clue that's at the bottom of the list. If you introduce a clue, advance the die to the next highest number. If you decide to remove a clue, reduce it instead. When you have the highest number on the die showing, the next player can choose to either get rid of the last clue (and play continues) or proceed to the solution.<br/><br/>The solution works like this: take the bottom clue on the list and do a single cut of a montage showing how that clue relates to the solution to the mystery.

What does that really mean?  Minimal intent, the dice tell you the number of successes but not what they are.  It's the evil mirror-universe version of Wushu where details happen and the degree of success is rolled.  <br/><br/>Action Man with a skill of four and a pool of seven dice for HTH combat has the drop on a band of pesky ninjas (five total).  He assigns three dice to defense/move and four to offense.  Rolling 1,2,5 and 1,2,4,5 he get to define five success/facts.  "I drop down between two of the ninja (one move) and double backhand both of them (two offense successes). Before they can react, I roll forward (second move) and sweep kick another one (third offense.)"  Because the ninjas where surprised, they have no offense to threaten Action Man with this turn.<br/><br/>These are one die mooks, so the three that took one hit lose their only die and are knocked out/killed.<br/><br/>Next round, the GM secretly writes down that both of the mooks both go on offense with their 3 skill.  Action Man decides to spend four dice on defense/move and three on offense.  Everyone rolls together.  The ninjas get a 3 and a 1 for two successes while AM gets 1,1,4,5 and 3,4,6 for five more successes (three defense, two offense.  The player and GM decide that two ninja throw shiruken at AM but he burns two defense successes to deflect the stars with his bracers, steps forward (burning all three defense/move successes), and bashes the two ninja skulls together and thus ending the fight.<br/><br/>Character Creation:  <br/>*ding*<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_327460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327460/#Comment_327460" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-02T00:33:30+00:00" title="June  2, 2011 12:33AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's Hard!<br/><br/>You are Bob, 39 years old, married, with three kids.

She has a very active imagination.  Her brother, Erstwhile, might be an alien.  Emily tells every adult she meets, but no one believes her.  She is, after all, four years old.<br/><br/><br/>This is a game for three players.  One of you will play Emily, one will play Erstwhile, and one will play a parent or authority figure.  After each scene, you'll trade roles off to the person on your left.<br/><br/><b>Parent player</b>: You start the scene by describing what mundane task the family is doing, like grocery shopping or eating breakfast.  Your job is to act like a parent: keep your kids under control and teach them right from wrong.  You can make any statement you want in a scene.  Your goal is to guess correctly whether Erstwhile is or is not an alien.  You also decide when your errand is complete and the scene ends.  When you end a scene, write down whether you believe Emily that Erstwhile is an alien, or not.  Keep these is a separate pile from Erstwhile's secrets.  <br/><br/><b>Erstwhile's player</b>: write down at the start of a scene whether you are a normal kid or an alien in disguise. Keep these is a separate pile from the parent's guesses.  Your goal is to act like a normal, hyperactive child of eight years.  Your goal is also to make the parent guess wrong.  Act normal when an alien, or weird when a regular kid, or change things up if the parent guessed right before.  The biggest difficulty is that you can only make statements starting with "Yes, and..."<br/><br/><b>Emily's player</b>: Play a hyperactive, imaginative child.  Try to convince your parent that Erstwhile is an alien.  You can only start sentences with "Yes, but..."  Point out how Erstwhile's weird acts are part of a sinister alien plot.<br/><br/>After several rounds of play, you can end the story when everyone agrees it is time to end.  Count up the votes of the parent players to determine whether the parent believes or not (majority wins).  Then count up the Erstwhile votes to see if he was really an alien or not (majority wins).  From there, collectively determine whether the alien invasion is foiled or succeeds, or if the parent is taken away to an insane asylum or just lives a normal, mundane life.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_327616">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327616/#Comment_327616" name="Item_23" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-03T02:23:36+00:00" title="June  3, 2011  2:23AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 3, 2011 2:34AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF BABEL</b></span><br/><br/>In this game you are politicians of a very young fantasy-democracy; <i>The Peoples Republic of Babel</i>. You are meeting each-other in a series of debates, in all the major cities of the realm. While doing this you take turns drawing parts of the map. Keep the drawing simple. Put names on cities, great forests, mountain ranges and seas. <br/><br/>When you draw a portion of the map, you get +1 for the debate in that part of the realm. When the drawing is finished, you roll a die to determine how many seats that part of the realm holds in parliament (1-6 seats).<br/><br/><b>The character</b><br/>Make a name for your character, and a name for his/her political party. <br/><br/><b>Political issues:</b><br/>- The old king: should he be executed? And the queen? The princess and the three princes?<br/>- The Knights of the Queen: should they be dissolved, and/or made into "The Peoples Knights"?<br/>- The old nobility: should their lands be stripped off them, and given away or sold to the people?<br/><br/>- The army: the peoples army are ill-equipped, and arms are costly; what do we do?<br/>- The fleet: our fleet are weak; a handful of smaller ships; so do we build expensive lion-ships?<br/>- The border-fortresses: in ill repair, partly held by our neighbors; what do we do?<br/><br/>- The elves: should we try to talk with the "tree-singers", or promise a reward for any elven head?<br/>- The dwarves: they are few, and their riches are many, but their mountain fortress is mighty ...<br/>- The orcs: how should the orc-incursions in the south be dealt with?<br/><br/>- The great kingdom of Frangast: they supported the king and nobility, so how do we treat them?<br/>- The kingdom of Gormengalia: they supported the king and nobility, so how do we treat them?<br/>- The small dukedom of Harribut: they supported the king and nobility, so how do we treat them?<br/><br/>- Trade: the roads are in a bad condition since the civil war; how do we finance the repairs?<br/>- Shipping: how do we deal with the fact that a lot of great ships flew the realm in the civil war?<br/>- Illegal trade: how do you propose to deal with the illegal trade in magic mushrooms?<br/><br/>- Local democracy: do we establish a local parliament in each major city?<br/>- Should anyone but grown men, with property or a zeal of mastership, hold the right to vote?<br/>- President election: directly with individual candidates, or by votes in parliament?<br/><br/>- Constitution: what stands in the first paragraph; equality, brotherhood or freedom?<br/>- Justice: should the high court answer to the parliament, or should it be an independent institution?<br/>- Constitution: which groups among the populace should have privileges?<br/><br/><b>Debates</b><br/>You hold debates, in character; and end the debates by pointing to each-other; the one with the most fingers poiting at him/her, wins the debate and get +1 on the die roll. Then all of you roll the die for each seat of parliament in this region. In case of a tie the ones tied rolls again. Note down how many seats you get, and go on to the next region.<br/><br/>When all of you have drawn one region, and its major city has been debated in, you go on to the capital. That's where the final debate is held. None of you get any plus for drawing it, but one of you must do it anyway. The seats available in the capital is 9, so this debate may be quite important. Hodl the debate in the capital in the same way as the rest, with die-rolling at the end to determine who gets the seats.<br/><br/><b>Parliament</b><br/>In the end you sit down "in parliament", and decide who will rule for the next 5 years. This may be straightforward, if one of you got a majority of seats in parliament. If none have a majority, the one with the most seats will have to negotiate with the others, giving and taking political concessions, trying to forge a political alliance. If he/she fails the next in line may give it a try. If you do not succeed, you got to have a reelection (going trough the debates in the cities once more, winning the seats, and sitting down in parliament for a second time).<br/><br/>In the end one of you will be elected as ruling party, and the rest are obliged to applaud politely. The ruling party then decrees what his first act of ruling will be. It could be anything that fits his tastes; including turning the republic into a one-party state.<br/><br/>The game ends with the first ruling.<br/><br/>Have good game!<br/><br/>____________________________<br/>Took me 25 minutes, so I'm still slooow.

Take a fantasy book which you haven't read, and read out the blurb to you and your friends. That's the setting for this game. Then read the first sentence of the book. Put the book away.<br/><br/>Now, the person to your left flips over the top card of the deck. He may speak a number of words equal to the value of the card. If the card is black, he talks about how things go well. If the card is red, he talks about how things go poorly. He may finish his sentence, or leave it unfinished. <br/><br/>Then the player to his left flips over the top card of the deck. She may speak a number of words equal to the value of the card. Again, if it is black she talks about how things go well. If the card is red, she talks about how things go poorly. She may finish her sentence, or leave it unfinished.<br/><br/>If you wish, sentences with club cards are about violence, action and threat. Sentences with heart cards are about compassion, lust and personalities. Sentences with diamond cards are about greed, growth and ambition. Sentences with spade cards are about heroism, movement and reflection. In this case, black cards are no longer about good things and red cards no longer about bad things.<br/><br/>The face cards represent twists in the story. You decide what they represent. May I recommend that the Jack represents a trick or plot twist and the King a boon or plot advancement?

The image of burning attack ships and the glittering C-beams are still etched on your tearless retina, but you've made a new quiet life in the sprawling megacity. You've even found something to live for. But how long have you got? And will they come for you?<br/><br/>For this game you need some six-sided dice and at least one friend. Create characers: give them names, describe where they life, and what their reason for living is. Take turns being in the spotlight, playing your replicant. Set scenes for each other.<br/><br/>When you're faced with a challange, roll as many dice as you want. If you get at least one die that shows 4 or more, you've succeeded.<br/><br/>If your roll has any 1's, you've exposed yourself. Make a note. When you reach 5, the Blade Runner knows where you are. When you reach 7, the Blade Runner comes for you.<br/><br/>If your roll has any 6's, you've used a great deal of your energy, and your artificial life draws nearer to it's end. Make a note.

The action fails automatically, and those you care of will what you've done.<br/>For life: if the challange is directly related to your reason for living, you can make any die a 6 instead (pushing you closer to the final end).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_327988">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/327988/#Comment_327988" name="Item_37" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-06T10:17:14+00:00" title="June  6, 2011 10:17AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 6, 2011 10:32AM by TomasHVM.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>MATCH ME</b></span><br/>You play some of the members of a local soccer-team. Pick a mid-level team if available. You are not professional, but each of you is young and have great ambitions. <br/><br/>Make yourselves some names. The rest of the character will come along as you play.<br/><br/><b>Match</b><br/>Each match each of you roll a die. Odd numbers is good, Even numbers are bad. You need a 1 to score the first goal, a 3 to score the second, and a 5 to score the third, and then 1 again, and so forth. Any even numbers are a goal to the opposition.<br/><br/>Rolling a 1 is the best result, for any individual. It means you get high praise after the match, whatever the outcome. 3 and 5 is a good performance if you won, and average if you lost. Rolling an even number means you have made a significant mistake (penalty, red-card, self goal, lost the ball in a critical spot, etc.).<br/><br/><b>Post-match</b><br/>This game is all about what the players say to eachother between the matches; in the wardrobe, in the gym, on the training field, in a bus on route to a new match. <br/><br/>Each player set a scene after each match, and have the power to stop it too. Go around the table, setting one scene each.<br/><br/>The scenes should all be about how you praise and criticize each other. Try to develop some tense relationships; you don't have to be mature about loosing a match; someone should take the blame. <br/><br/>Set a scene by saying someting like this: <i>"We are in the gym, working out, when Raul start moaning about the last match again ..." </i> or "On the training field the trainer let us work harder than ever, to punish us for the last loss ...". When the scene is set, you all step into the character of yours, and start talking to each other as if you where there.<br/><br/>When all players have set a scene, you roll for the next match, and then you do a new round of scenes. You continue doing this until one of you comes out a winner ...<br/><br/><b>A winner</b><br/>If any player get a 1 on the die two times in a row, when rolling for the matches, he/she is noticed by a scout for some big club, and signed to them. The player in question decides for himself which club he/she is signed to. If this happens you end the game by setting a last round of scenes.<br/><br/>The last scenes should all be about the time before the player actually leaves the club, and may be anything. The other players may do their best to sabotage the "winner", but he/she always gets the last scene (and may save his honor, if possible).<br/><br/>Have a great match!<br/>____________________________<br/><br/>15 minutes!

Rotate the roles so everyone gets an equal amount of time being the each of the other people.<br/>4. Each player then gets a chance to tell everyone present what a bunch of fuckers they are. Players should attempt to speak at the same time rather than taking turns.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328734">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328734/#Comment_328734" name="Item_43" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T05:35:00+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  5:35AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's beautiful, Sean!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328743">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/doho123" title="doho123"><img alt="doho123" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/doho123">doho123</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328743/#Comment_328743" name="Item_44" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T07:02:44+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  7:02AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sad Robots<br/>\n<br/>\nAll players have robots that have mysteriously been activated some time in the distant future...alone, in a broken world, with no humans left, and must find their purpose<br/>\n<br/>\nThe games uses a Bandu set. Players take turns selecting a bandu piece and announce what the piece represents. it could be a bit of programming that has woken up, and found robot part, a clue as to what the purpose of the robot is; it is simply a story element. Players bid Bandu beads for use of the of the piece in their story, which the winner narrates. Other player robots can be involved in the story, of course, but the player who won the bid gets the piece.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe player can stack the piece on his Bandu tower by having the story element affect his robot "the most" in the narrative. Or he can force another player to add to their tower by narrating the story in such a way that the story element affects that player the most.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf a player's tower crashes down, his programming has "gone bad" and starts a system shut down...on his next turn, instead of selecting a piece, he can try to rebuild his tower, while detailing a part of how his computer mind is trying to "make the code" fit with each piece played on to the tower --  "this piece represents  a memory of my creator, mistakingly crossing a blue wire with red." <br/>\n<br/>\nIf the tower falls again, the shut down continues for his next turn. Regardless if the tower falls or not, the last piece instead of getting placed back on the tower is offered up as a story element for the rest of the table.<br/>\n<br/>\nonce all Bandu pieces have been assigned to players, a final epilogue is detailed for each player, with the hopes that each robot has discovered it's purpose...whether or not that that purpose can actually be fulfilled or not, and the ramifications of that is up to the players.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_328771">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328771/#Comment_328771" name="Item_45" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T09:19:47+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  9:19AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2011 2:19PM by Ross_Cowman.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Orange Juice</b><br/><br/>You'll Need:<br/>-Oranges<br/>-a Juicer (the hand kind that you hold over a glass)<br/>-Sharpies<br/>-2 friends<br/><br/>Do This:<br/>-each person sits around the table with an orange<br/>-draw a face on your orange<br/>-go around 3 times<br/><br/>the first time complete this sentence<br/>"On the day I was born ...."<br/><br/>the second time turn to the orange to the left and ask<br/>"Remember the day we....?"<br/><br/>the third time turn to the orange to the right and say<br/>"-On the day I died, you told me ..."<br/><br/>-juice the oranges<br/>-drink the juice<br/><br/>-for Tori Brewster                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_328774">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/zircher" title="zircher"><img alt="zircher" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i265.photobucket.com/albums/ii221/zircher/hex_dot.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/zircher">zircher</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328774/#Comment_328774" name="Item_46" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T09:23:59+00:00" title="June  9, 2011  9:23AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 9, 2011 9:24AM by zircher.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As role playing games go, that sounds rather cannibalisitic.  ;-)<br/>--<br/>TAZ                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_328807">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328807/#Comment_328807" name="Item_47" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-09T10:44:40+00:00" title="June  9, 2011 10:44AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is great stuff!<br/><br/>End by eating your character!

You need 4-6 friends.  Two of you play the young couple (who might be man and wife to be, though making it two young men or two young women marrying each other might explain some of the family's reluctance).  The rest of the players play other participants in the wedding ceremony: parents, siblings, the priest or justice of the peace, the flower girl, whatever.<br/><br/>Write these things on some cards, shuffle them and hand one out to each player.

They describe their character preparing for or participating int he wedding, and need to work toward what is written on the card.  Once they bring that element into play, then they can end the scene at a good time and let the next lowest numbered card scene happen.  Repeat until the actual literal shotgun comes out, in the hands of one of the PCs.<br/><br/>Once the shotgun is revealed, do one more round of scenes in the same order, ending with a scene where the shotgun actually goes off, one way or another.

Maybe - GQ and Details if you want to play a guy, Vogue and Cosmo if you want to play a chick, Candy or Alt Fashion if you want something different. Cut out bits and pieces, and collage together an image of your tuxedo mage. It doesn't have to be realistic, like, but it definitely needs to convey precisely the sort of tuxedo magic you wield.<br><br>Tuxedo magic is the worst type of magic. Worst in that it's accessible to the lowest common denominator (you), worst in that it has the most undesirable impact on society, and worst in that it drains the user. Why are you a tuxedo mage? Write this answer next to your collage.<br><br>Broke City is a shit place to live, and nobody likes it. But no one ever leaves, because you can check out of Broke City, but you can never leave. Since you can't ever leave Broke City, your goal is to carve out your own little empire, to hoard something, or to get back something that Broke City stole from you. Decide your goal, but don't write it anywhere. Ever.<br><br>You are rich. You have all the best friends, but they are the worst people. The other collage characters are some of your friends, but they're all lying bitches.<br><br>PLAY<br><br>Go about your life, and try to accomplish whatever it is that you want to accomplish.<br><b><br>When you trade up in the world,</br></b> cut out a new collage piece and glue it onto your collage (probably covering up something beneath).<br><b><br>When you trade down in the world</br></b>, someone else cuts out a new collage piece (from their magazine) and glues it onto your collage.<br><b><br>When you do tuxedo magic</br></b>, pick an area of your collage and colour it in with sharpie.<br><br><b>When you lie, cheat or steal</b>, if it affects another collage character: colour on someone else's collage. If not: colour on the blank piece of paper in the middle of the table.<br><br>TUXEDO MAGIC<br><br>Tuxedo Magic lets you do all sorts of stuff.

Examples: "The day I accidentally ate a live worm." / "The time my boyfriend caught me smooching with his younger brother." / "The time my pants fell down at a dance while I was attempting to moonwalk." <br/><br/>The cards are shuffled and passed out face down, randomly.<br/><br/>Each player then delivers a brief, fictional explanation of how he or she was "scarred for life" by the experience described on the card in front of him/her. Each description should involve at least three elements - something one can no longer do, something the sight of which makes one faint, and some person that one no longer trusts. Example: "I can't floss my teeth in a mirror any more, I pass out whenever I see a live opossum, and I can't even be in the same room as anybody with buck teeth." The one constraint upon each description is that it may not contain any nouns, verbs, or adjectives that were on the relevant card (or synonyms thereof).<br/><br/>After every player has taken a turn, everybody points to the individual whom each thinks ended up with hir or her own awful secret was revealed. Cards are passed across the table to whomever is pointing at each card holder. A show of hands may be used to figure out who was right or who was wrong, and one point is awarded for each correct guess, as well as for each description that led to a correct guess.<br/><br/>All of the cards are then immediately shredded and another round is played. The winner is the first person to get twice the number of points as there are players. Or, alternatively, the last person provoked to uncontrollable weeping.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_328947">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/328947/#Comment_328947" name="Item_56" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-10T05:22:27+00:00" title="June 10, 2011  5:22AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Ross Cowman</cite>I'm going to run some of these at GPNW</blockquote>That's great!

Oops!<br/><br/><b>Conception</b><br/>For three to four players.<br/><br/>Whenever you do something, you do it. If someone thinks maybe you can't do it, you have to prove that motherfucker wrong. With only a six-sided die.<br/><br/>Roll it. On a 1, it goes horrendously wrong. Look at the person to your left (the sinister direction). Ask them how it goes horrendously wrong.<br/><br/>On a 6, it goes horrendously right. Seriously, horrendously. As in, you were not expecting it to go that well. Look at the person to your right (the righteous direction). Ask them how it goes horrendously right.<br/><br/>Anything in between is up to you. A 2 is worse than a 5, that's all I'm going to say.<br/><br/>Practice good scene framing, if you know how. You've played GMless games before, right? No?<br/><br/>Okay, then in the beginning you nominate someone to go first. That person decides whether to set the scene or let it be set. If the active player wants someone else to set the scene, they just have to point at someone and say "You. Tell me what the fuck is going on."<br/><br/>Say what's obvious. Just go with it. Take no more than five seconds to frame the scene. Describe how things are going in the scene until someone doubts you. Then roll for resolution (on the conflict level), and the player on your left becomes the active player. When play comes back around to you, start a new scene. If your last scene ended with an unacceptable cliffhanger, then go ahead and continue that scene. In general, try to start and end scenes in one turn.<br/><br/>There is no character generation or default setting. That will come in time, Padawan. By that I mean, just play the game to find out who you are and what you can do.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_330832">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB" title="PeterBB"><img alt="PeterBB" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/PeterBB">PeterBB</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/330832/#Comment_330832" name="Item_71" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-20T11:30:55+00:00" title="June 20, 2011 11:30AM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            The Underground: a game about the shady background dealings of politicians.<br/><br/>You play a character who is either a politician, a flunky, or a hitman.

You sit on simple kitchen chairs, in a circle, as close as you can get. Really close! <br/><br/>And then you follow the routine described below.<br/><br/><b>The Promise</b><br/>Take hands in the circle, and promise each other to stay in-character in every scene you play in, and to stay in your seat until the game is over. Do this in a soft voice, together. <br/><br/><b>The Character</b><br/>The oldest player start talking very softly to the others, and the one to his left follow suit, with a soft woice, and so forth ...<br/><br/>- State your name first, one by one. Choose a name of your own gender.<br/><br/>- State your occupation, one by one.<br/><br/>- State a positive relation to one of the others, while touching him/her on the shoulder or the arm, or caressing his/her cheek. Do this one by one.<br/><br/>- State a negative relation to one of the others, while poking your index finger into his/her shoulder. Do this one by one.<br/><br/><b>The World</b><br/>One by one, starting with the oldest player, you say one thing about the world of these characters. When everyone has said one thing about the world, you are ready to start playing.<br/><br/><b>The Gameplay</b><br/>You take turns framing scenes. Each scene must consist of 2 or more characters. The one framing the scene decides who is in it. <br/><br/>When framing a scene you may make up new things about the world. And you place the characters wherever you want in the world. Speak softly while doing this, to keep the mood low and intense.<br/><br/>When the scene is framed and ready for interaction, the players of the included characters step into their roles, and talk as if they were there. talk softly, to indicate you are intimate with each other (<i>intimate</i> in a sore, friendly or sexual way, depending on the scene). If you say something about another character, indicating a change in his/her life, it counts as a truth for that character, and must be adhered to (so your character may become married by another character/player asking: "How is your wife these days?"). Make use of this fact to turn the screws on your relationships, for good or for bad ...<br/><br/>The one framing the scene may include new elements in it, and other characters (both player and non-player). He/she may give non-player characters to players not included in the scene, or play them him/herself. <br/><br/>The framer is the one ending the scene. He/she may end it whenever he want to, by saying CUT. Play then stops immediately. Do not make the scenes too long. Let it reach a turning-point, or a cliffhanger, and cut it. Let the story roll through all the scenes, not just one.<br/><br/>The player to the left becomes the new "framer". He/she'll be framing a new scene in the same way. The new scene may take place a minute, a day, a month or a year later.<br/><br/>Play continues like this until someone declares a last round. Each player will be framing a scene in the last round, and then all the characters gather in some place you agree on, and play out a scene with all of them present. If you got a dead character at this stage, it will still be present in the last scene, through memories you narrate for the others (small tidbits of words and happenings they remember about your character). <br/><br/>Let the last scene ends when you feel like it. <br/><br/><b>Take hands in a circle, and give thanks for the game.</b></span></span></i><br/>___________________________<br/><br/>Way over the time-limit with this one, but it's the kind of game I like to design, and play.

You will collectively tell the story of a prominent conservative politician, who is <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Wide%20Stance" rel="nofollow">also a closeted homosexual</a>.<br/><br/>The first player is Lies.  He tells everyone what the politician's political party's positions are on political issues, particularly those involving gay rights.<br/><br/>Once he has spoken, the second player, the Public Persona, speaks, describing his candidate's positions, and how those relate to the party's (more moderate/more extreme).  Narrate the politician giving a public speech.<br/><br/>Then the third player speaks, acting as Damned Lies.  Damned Lies describes the politicians secret urgings and actions behind closed doors to fulfill these actions.  These urges and actions always run counter to the party's positions, the Persona's statements, or both.<br/><br/>Then the fourth player is Statistics, who tells us how opinions polls and the American people react to the politician's public acts.  More extreme/bigoted political positions are rewarded, while more moderate ones punished.<br/><br/>Then you go back to the first player (Lies), and repeat the process.  Repeat until the Damned Lies's actions are so extreme that he is exposed, or until the Statistics is so satisfied that the politician is elected King Forever.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_331024">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/331024/#Comment_331024" name="Item_80" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-06-21T13:41:45+00:00" title="June 21, 2011  1:41PM">June 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 21, 2011 2:10PM by NickWedig.">edited June 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Actually, Wide Stance might work better with three players, so the roles would rotate around the table, with each person trying out each role.

There are 28 dominos in a Double Six pack.  And, there are 55 in a Double Nine pack.  If using double nines, each player has six postive and three negative numbered attributes.]<br/><br/>Play begins with the owner of the dominos although they can pass that role to anyone around the table if desired and accepted.  Play proceeds around the table clockwise.<br/><br/>The first player sets the scene and then plays one of their hidden dominos.  Depending on what pips are shown, the player has to advance the story based on those attributes.  <br/><br/>For example, player A has:<br/><br/>1: Kung Fu fighter<br/>2: Karaoke King<br/>3: Drives the Girls Wild<br/>4: Strong, silent type (when not on stage)<br/>5: Alcoholic<br/>6: Hunted by the Mob<br/><br/>If player A reveals a 2/5 tile, they have to narrate something about singing and drinking.  If the tile is a double, it has some wild and chaotic effect on the story.<br/><br/>If the played domino has a blank, it's a wild card, but it's always narrated as a failure and the player may even end up being hurt.  If a player has to play the double blank (and it should always be played last from their hand), that character is taken out usually in a serious way.  But, as a double wildcard, they can describe it however they like.<br/><br/>Play continues around the table until all the tiles have been played.  It is the job of the last player with the last tile to wrap the story up.<br/>--<br/>TAZ<br/><br/><br/>Designer's note: [After the five minute limit] The scene framing happens after character creation and the tile draw, that's intentional.  Hopefully, that means the starting player's character and tiles should have some impact on the scene.<br/><br/>This game was inspired by someone mentioning that Nuemon used dominos.

Value the traits from 1 (weak) to 5 (strong). <br/><br/>- Do not look at what characters others are making, until every one of you have finished. Then you all say your name, and start the game.<br/><br/>- Take turns setting scenes; in your scene you play your character. The other players play therapists, trying to help you with you delusions. <br/><br/>- The therapists may make use of any medicine or other "treatment" they believe will help ... One of them, or all, may barge in on your scene (and your room, of course) whenever they like to, even if the scene is you <i>escaping</i> from the asylum (there is no escape).<br/><br/>- The other players have total control over the physical world. They may use any amount of force necessary to restrain you. And they may nullify anything your character tries to do (but not what he/she says), by saying that what the character think is there, don't actually exist. <br/><br/>- You may protest to their treatment of you by using one of your traits. If you succeed in rolling a T6 equal to or lower than your trait, you succeed in protesting, and may do something to prolong the time before you give up and comply. You may never use the same trait twice in one scene. If you roll higher, you must comply to their treatments. BUT: you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> try to break free of their spell, if you still got traits to use. If you got no traits to use, you must comply totally to all their demands and treatments.<br/><br/>- The scene will only end if you comply totally with the demands and treatments they give you in the scene.<br/><br/>- Every trait you have used in a scene, will be reduced by one point for the rest of the game. Traits that are reduced to 0 (zero) are said to be "healed". The therapists may praise you for the "good progress".<br/><br/>- When all have been subjected to three scenes as "nuts", you play a final scene; <b>the Xmas party at the madhouse</b>. You have been placed around the same table, and been restrained in some way to your seat (by belts, straight-jackets, total psychic domination, or heavy medicine; you choose). Start by telling, one by one, how your character sit by the table. The the scene is open for dialogue; you may try to talk to each other, to ask the therapists for food or drink, to remember your real name, to find your sanity, whatever ... by verbal means only.<br/><br/>- Play this scene until all of you are really, really happy, or totally broken, or strangely removed from the real world.<br/><br/><b>Have fun!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_333959">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve" title="GB_Steve"><img alt="GB_Steve" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://l-userpic.livejournal.com/103556612/3813106"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/GB_Steve">GB_Steve</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/333959/#Comment_333959" name="Item_95" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-12T04:19:09+00:00" title="July 12, 2011  4:19AM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Here's one I wrote four years ago.<br/><br/><b>Medium</b><br/>Voila, le MJ, c'est le medium et les joueurs jouent des participants a une seance de spiritisme. Tout les persos sont la parce qu'ils ont un probleme dans leur vie qu'ils veulent resoudre. Ce probleme est decid\xe9 par chaque joueur au depart. Ils choississent aussi un nom et repartissent 10 points de characteristiques parmi Corps, Esprit, Intellect (max 5, min 1). <br/><br/>Le MJ commence par decrire un contacte. "Je vois un homme, un vieux qui est pass\xe9 au-dela. Il s'appelle Robert, ..." <br/><br/>Quand un joueur a envi de participer, il leve la main et dit ce que le contacte veut dire pour lui. "Oui, c'est mon oncle. Il nous a quitt\xe9 la semaine derniere". <br/><br/>Maintenenant, le jeu se deroule en flashback pour completer la feuille de perso de celui qui a eu le contacte. Pour chaque flashback les autres joueurs vont jouer les PnJ et le MJ va jouer le contacte. Les PnJ ont 8 points de characteristiques et une competence et le contacte 12 points et trois competences. <br/><br/>Chaque flashback est une scene (comme un Accomplishment de Dogs in the Vineyard) ou le perso va determiner une de ses competences. Par exemple, une scene ou on va voir si le perso peut faire confiance a son Oncle. Si oui il gagne la competence "Je fait confiance aux autres". Si non, "Je ne fait pas confiance aux autres". <br/><br/>Le systeme de resolution c'est 1d6 par point de characteristique + 2 par competence applicable. Un 5 ou un 6, c'est une reussite. Face au un autre perso, c'est le nombre de reussites de chaque cote qui determine la victoire, sinon le MJ choisi un niveau de difficult\xe9. Ce systeme resoud des actions dans la scene. En fin de scene les joueurs votent pour quelle competence le PJ gagne. <br/><br/>On peut resoudre un PJ a la fois, ou chacun prend un tour pour une competence. <br/><br/>Une fois que le perso a quatre competences, on passe a essayer de resoudre le probleme qui a ete choisi au depart.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_334305">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/334305/#Comment_334305" name="Item_96" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-07-13T14:01:42+00:00" title="July 13, 2011  2:01PM">July 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<b>Q &amp; A</b><br/><br/>Take turns asking each other questions.

Nonetheless they are free to add details to their description whenever they like.<br/><br/>Player 2 is the Cassandra figure. They may be a professional rival to P1 or an ivestigator chasing up some sort of irregularity. They get to describe the disaster, and it's offscreen and backscreen condsequences.<br/><br/>Player 3 is a personable figure. They have narrative rights over the fates and responses of the many innocents caught up in the disaster zone.<br/><br/>Player 4 is the guy with the cellphone/ walkie-talkie / mayoral chain.

We all drew maps, and then rolled to see who would be the mapper (and set the other maps aside).<br> <br>The explorers didn\u2019t tell the mapper what they were looking for, and we didn\u2019t even come close to finding it (by chance, both explorers wanted to find their slave brothers; neither was particularly focused).<br><br>The mapper didn\u2019t have experience as a GM or story gamer, but fell very comfortably into the roll. A lot of it slipped into free form; having a \u2018When you take an action\u2019 move like the \u2018While travelling\u2019 and \u2018Whenever you reach a destination\u2019 moves might have encouraged us to return to the dice as arbiters.<br/>One thing he struggled to do was find names on the fly. Perhaps the mapping process should include a list of names. It was also unclear if the mapper explained the map to us before we made characters, or if the map was the only evidence we had of the world.<br/><br/>The adventure began in Dragonreach, in the far south of the Empire. I was a successful plantation owner (we grew firespice) who, as it turned out, had freed his family slaves. Gareesh Grogan of House Grogan, Grogan family, I called myself (it was important to distinguish us from the Bastard Grogans).<br/><br/>The map made it clear that slavery and mithril were important, and that the region was tropical and volcanic. Because \u2018something unexpected\u2019 was run into (a blind man claiming to be able to navigate treacherous waters to an unknown and unexplored island rich in mithril), that became our priority.<br/><br/>To disguise our plan to raise a fleet in Freehaven, we took a shipment of weapons to Fort Doomhammer, where mithril had been used to channel molten lava from an active volcano into walls and fortifications. From there we travelled to Freehaven, a hidden city of ex-slaves who lived in a communist utopia. The women there were named after flowers, but I discovered that Rose had her thorns and a Lily by any other name would smell as sweet.<br/><br/>We made it through the treacherous waters to the unnamed island, duelled with the locals (who fought with weapons roughly hewn from mithril ore) and made a trading agreement. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed it. I think it\u2019s a gentle introduction to the GM\u2019s position because the mapper has inspiration in front of them and the plot is all player-directed. I think the endgame could use some work; I\u2019m not sure that rolling a 6 after reaching a destination is the best way to do it (we just finished up after 4 hours). <br/><br/>(Assuming the game and supplement took 10 minutes to write, we played Explorers! for 24 times longer than it took to write.)                        </br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_340756">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife" title="whiteknife"><img alt="whiteknife" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/522/nPNU33AUD5435.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/whiteknife">whiteknife</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/340756/#Comment_340756" name="Item_108" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-08-28T09:32:17+00:00" title="August 28, 2011  9:32AM">August 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad you liked Explorers!

After at least 6 things have been prevented, the agents reconvene with the cards to figure out what the terrible event was.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_341582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/341582/#Comment_341582" name="Item_121" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-09-04T23:01:46+00:00" title="September  4, 2011 11:01PM">September 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            LOL!

Having one person frame the scene as the tune starts, and then to open it up for interaction pretty damn fast, is advisable. And then you let the tune end the scene, whatever the situation is.

Pick a grand name for your heroes, and start the game.<br><br>You take turns setting scenes, going from the oldest player and to the left. Setting a scene is easy; you sing!<br>This is what you sing when setting a scene:<br>- Who is there; I or we<br>- Where are I/we<br>- What is happening<br><br><b>Who ...</b> <br>- is indicated by starting the song with "I" or "we". <br><br>If you sing "I" it is you alone, possibly with some minor character. If you introduce a minor character, any other player may jump in to play it, singing his/her voice in the scene. <br><br>If you sing "we", all the players will have to play their own hero in the scene, and everything said or done by any minor characters should be described in point of view of your character(s). <br><br/>Example: <i>We raged against the villain! We raged, we aged in anger before his eyes! But he was unscathed by our wrath, growing as it fed him, black robe dancing around his powerful form! Dancing-dancing-dancing around his form! And the foul fiend laughed at us, shouting, yes shouting; none shall survive! None-none-none shall suuuurviiive!</i><br/><br/><b>Where ...</b><br/>- is indicated by singing about the place. Be short; one or two details are enough. You are the one deciding where the scene takes place. Others should not give advice on it. Sing it out with little care for consequences! Any scene is fine! You will make it work, together.<br/><br/>Example: <i>We were standing on the pier! The tempest raging all around us!</i> <br/><br/><b>What ...</b><br/>- is indicated by singing what is happening. The minute you have indicated something is happening in the scene, you should let other players into the scene, so you may sing choirs and duets, and have fun together.<br/><br/>Example: <i>In the sunrise I saw her, sweat Aurora, coming towards me with flames in her hair! Oh, my love! Oh, my angel! Oh, my burning heart! She came towards me, and sung the words of beauty, the ones I had longed to hear ...</i> (player looking meaningfully at other players, willing any one of them to jump in to sing Auroras part, and "the words of beauty" ...). <br/><br/>End your scene by "conducting" it with your hands, indicating a stop and silence. And then you give the initiative over, with a polite and silent nod, to the player on your left.<br/><br/><b>Go forward ...</b><br/>- by making leaps of time and faith! Let new scenes jump ahead, and be somewhere else, something new happening. It is very nice to create new developments or twists in the drama, and it is very nice to introduce new elements. Don't sing about what has taken place between scenes. If need be, it will be revealed in the things you sing in the scenes. <br/><br/><b>Challenges ...</b><br/>- is a road to great fun in this game. Doing challenges, and answering them, makes the game come alive between you. Of course you may fail to make something grand out of it, if challenged to do just that, but that is ok.  There is only fun to be had in "failing"! Any clumsy wording and tune will add to the beauty of this game. You are all excellently equipped, by clumsiness, to participate! Enjoy any clumsiness!<br/><br/>In one of the examples above, players are challenged to sing "words of beauty". One of them should rise to the challenge, of course, and sing something to that effect. Even if the words sung is an overdone clich\xe9, you should all treat them as "words of beauty". They have been introduces as such, and that is what they should be considered to be, in the drama. There is much fun to be had by saying stupid things, and treating them as the deepest wisdom.<br/><br/><b>Sing ...</b><br/>- it out! All of you will sing everything you do and say, as the heroes. <br/><br/>Keep to the singing, even the bits about going to the loo or <i>Pleeease pass the chiiips!

As far as I know, she never played it. A few months ago at work, I was bored and whipped up a quick "Revised" edition as part of the 5-minute game design challenge, basically recreating it from memory, and I just found my notes on it. So now I'm typing it up in all its redesigned-in-five-minutes glory as a late-in-the-day Christmas Present for all of you. Enjoy!<br/><br/>TINY ROBOTS SAVE THE UNIVERSE (Revised Edition)<br/><br/>You are a band of tiny robots, who by circumstance or design now have to save the universe. Why is the universe in peril? And why is it up to a group of tiny robots to save it? That's up to you as a group to determine.<br/><br/>Each player comes up with one to three Components. Things like Rocket Jets or 'Advanced Computronium Core or Blinking Red Light or things like that. Also come up with what they do, writing each on an index card. Shuffle them all up.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 100 build points. Reveal the first card, bid on it, highest bidder gets the component, repeat until all the components are distributed. The GM gets 100 points as well to bid for the Bad Robot.<br/><br/>After bidding, each player (and the Bad Robot) gets an Action Score equal to the number of players (including the GM) who have less build points remaining than them, plus one.<br/><br/>When you do something risky or uncertain, roll a number of d6 equal to your action score, plus any modifiers for Components. The GM sets the difficulty (they can roll dice instead of setting a specific number, if they want.)<br/><br/>Good luck saving the universe!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_352493">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352493/#Comment_352493" name="Item_134" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-26T01:28:23+00:00" title="December 26, 2011  1:28AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 26, 2011 1:29AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you very much!

You need to be 3-5 grown up people with children, houses, cars, jobs, mortgages, etc.<br/><br/>Start the game by making a bunch of notes on calamities you may experience in your life; things like your house burning down, children being hurt/dying, cars crashing, loosing your job, your arm, your wife, etc. Anything you can think of should be jotted down on the cards. Anything but the death of yourself.<br/>- Do it in secret. Don't share the content of you cards.<br/>- Write in short and clear paragraphs, as the cards will be shared.<br/>- The cards are  laid in one great pile, and mixed.<br/><br/><b>Example of cards:</b><br/><i>- Garage burned down<br/>- Grandmother died<br/>- Lost a leg<br/>- Denoted to errand-boy</i><br/><br/><b>Playing the game:</b><br/>This is a game about a jolly bunch of friends. They meet up on the soccer-field, at the bus-stop, in the super-mall, anywhere obvious and unoriginal you can think of.<br/><br/>Before each scene you pick a card, at random, from the pile in the center of the table. This has just happened to you. It's up to you to explain how and why. You don't have to be original in doing so; loosing a leg in a car-crash, f.ex., is quite good enough.<br/><br/>Start each scene by saying where you are, and point to one or two others who are there too, meeting you.  Picking the same location several times is very nice. Varying who is present in a scene, is very nice. Try to include your fellow players in equal amounts of scenes.<br/><br/>- You always start the dialogue in the scene by saying "Hi!", and asking each other "How do you do?"<br/>- when someone ask you, the one who picked the card, you may say something like this; "I'm well, thank you! My wife left me this morning ..."<br/>- and then you proceed to say how this has made your life BETTER. The other ones interviewing you about that fact, possibly offering some sympathy. You must insist on NOT needing any pity or sympathy. You are a JOLLY guy/girl, in JOLLY company!<br/><br/>- Calamities already on the heads of people not present in the scene, may also be discussed. Loads of sympathy may be heaped on the head of those not present! You gossip about their misfortunes, with as much energy as you praise your own luck in loosing your wife, child, house, car, job, arm, etc.<br/><br/>Go on like this until one of you declare he/she is DEAD, in a scene, insisting on being the ghost of your late self, come back to tell the others how JOLLY the burning fires of Hell really is! That's the last scene. <br/>- Anyone may initiate this scene, by claiming to be dead when the dialogue in their scene opens. <br/>- Play out the scene as normal. <br/>- Interviewing a jolly guy/girl from Hell should be interesting.<br/><br/><b>Good luck!</b> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_352580">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352580/#Comment_352580" name="Item_136" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-28T01:49:27+00:00" title="December 28, 2011  1:49AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 28, 2011 1:50AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            76 games!<br/><br/>I wonder if there's any chance we'll reach one hundred ...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_352781">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/352781/#Comment_352781" name="Item_137" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-12-30T02:31:03+00:00" title="December 30, 2011  2:31AM">December 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 30, 2011 2:56AM by TomasHVM.">edited December 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Posted a game not suited for this challenge.

And a cup of tea!<br/><br/>1 - On pieces of paper; each of you write down, in secret, what you would wish for as your own personal superpower, if you had one.<br/><br/>2 - Give the paper to the player to the left. He/she will play YOU in this game, but an increasingly SUPER version of you.<br/><br/>3 - You are a bunch of friends in our world, gathering to discuss the strange things (your super-powers manifesting) that has happened lately.<br/><br/>4 - As you are new to the powers, they start pretty low; on level 1. You roll the die each time you need to call on your powers, and need to roll equal or lower to make it. If you make it, point to a player who tells how you succeed. If you don't make the roll, you will tell how you fail.<br/><br/>5 - Each time you use a super-power, it increase one level. This happens regardless of success or failure.<br/><br/>6 - Once a super-power reaches level 5, a SUPER-VILLAIN will emerge to battle the hero (one for each hero). A super-villain must be defeated 3 times to be dead/harmless/gone. If you loose one battle against a super-villain, you can only defeat that villain with the help of other heroes in the future. You need help from one or more other heroes to have a chance, but roll normally, against your own powers.<br/><br/>7 - No SUPER-HERO ever dies. He gets hurt, loose his girlfriend, are captured and tortured ... he may also loose his powers! But always, ALWAYS, the hero will escape to fight another day!<br/><br/>8 - the first scene takes place where you are now, and you are talking (in character) about the strange/wonderful/freakish things that is happening to you ... and sharing the fright and/or wonder of it. When the talk reach some kind of conclusion, you go on and frame new scenes.<br/><br/>9 - Go around the table, framing scenes for each other. The oldest player start framing a scene. You always frame scenes for the player to the right of you, but you may include other heroes in the scene too.<br/><br/>10 - It is possible that not all of your close relatives and friends will be happy about the changes in your life (the danger, the new friends, the freakish nature of your powers, etc). Try to juxtapose the action-scenes with turmoil at home ...<br/><br/><i>Have fun!</i> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_353761">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JimD" title="JimD"><img alt="JimD" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JimD">JimD</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/353761/#Comment_353761" name="Item_139" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-10T13:47:28+00:00" title="January 10, 2012  1:47PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2012 1:49PM by JimD.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Trouble on Cobalt Station<br/><br/>A game for several players and a GM<br/><br/>You and your pals are stranded on a space station that was sucked into a wormhole and got through whole, but you're separated from the rest of humanity with no chance of reuniting.<br/><br/>You have six stats:<br/>Fight<br/>Think<br/>Move<br/>Detect<br/>Convince<br/>Resist<br/><br/>Assign (+) to two, assign (-) to two.<br/><br/>When you do something, pick the two stats that apply, no more, no less.

They must be mundane, but quirky. The group together decides the numbers for the character's stats: Weirdo and Badass, which are both quite low.<br/><br/>The character spends some time setting up the plot, while the other players GM and throw silly things on them.<br/><br/>Everyone has a notebook where they must write things down furiously, every silly little thing that happens. Players are encouraged to draw lines, cross over stuff and write comments next to their notes, without sharing to each other.<br/><br/>After a while, the next character is introduced, bringing the number of full-time gm's down one. Keep doing this until there's one gm and the rest of the players have a character each. Each introduced character must have a higher Weirdo or Badass stat than the previously introduced one, and may have a higher stat in both.<br/><br/><br/>When a character tries to do something and the outcome isn't obvious, first see if anyone can bring something up from their notes. Otherwise, roll dice, adding Badass if it's fighting or stunts, and Weirdo if it's anything else.<br/><br/>*ding* here's where my five minutes are up.<br/><br/>Extra rules:<br/>Extra characters can be introduced, to be played by anyone, including the gm. If the gm starts playing a character who ends up a protagonist, however, they should be taken over by another player.<br/><br/>Remember that everyone should have their notebooks at the ready all the time, not just the player who ends up being gm.<br/><br/>When all characters have been introduced, it's okay to start making up new stats. No character can have more than three, but the first, weakest, character, probably needs that you recognise their bravery, or leadership skills, or some such, as a new (higher) stat.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_354030">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/354030/#Comment_354030" name="Item_141" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-12T02:36:23+00:00" title="January 12, 2012  2:36AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really like that simple way of doing characters, setting and plot in one furious go!

game for 6 or more players<br/><br/>Divide your players into pairs.  One of these players will be the Face of a player character.  The other will be the Inner Voice of the same character.  <br/>(If you have 5 or fewer players, you can instead have each player be the Inner Voice of the character on their left.)<br/><br/>All your characters are at a dinner party and are socializing with each other.<br/><br/>The Face players should establish how their characters know each other character.<br/><br/>When the Face player declares how their PC knows someone, the Inner Voice of that character will explain why the PC secretly hates them.<br/><br/>Every time the Face speaks, the Inner Voice explains what really means.The Face presents the obvious, surface level interactions.  The Inner Voice says what is implied or the subtext of anything the Face says.  The job of the Face is to be as nice and friendly as possible.  The job of the Inner Voice is to twist the Face's actions to be mean, twisted, petty and nasty.  The other character hear the Face's words, but they understand what the Inner Voice is implying.  Inner Voices drive the game towards conflict, while the Faces smooth it over.<br/><br/>Play until the dinner party is over, one way or the other.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_356973">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig" title="NickWedig"><img alt="NickWedig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/910/n62XPANY8ZT3Q.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NickWedig">NickWedig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356973/#Comment_356973" name="Item_153" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T10:57:29+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 10:57AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Inner Voice" isn't exactly the right word, but it was the best I could come up with in the 5 minutes allotted.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_357007">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357007/#Comment_357007" name="Item_154" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T12:27:19+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 12:27PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mr. Teapot</cite>The Dinner Party</blockquote>I really like this one! <br/><br/>It reads a lot like a mini-larp to me, and a good one!

Which one of you most recently laughed at someone else's misfortune? BADASS! You're the Shoulder Devil; the other is left with being Shoulder Angel. Sorry.<br/><br/>Find a friend. Accost an acquaintance. Engage an enemy. Whatever - just find someone to follow around. Stand as close to their shoulder (right for the Angel, left for the Devil) as you can. When you'give them advice, whisper as close to their ear as you can. Bonus points if you make them jump (not you, angel).<br/><br/>Feel free, both of you, to narrate your host's life as he/she lives it ... with some embellishments if you like. Obviously this works best if everyone else in the room can hear you narrating your host's inner thoughts - he/she is the protagonist, after all!<br/><br/>When you decide that the host has come to a moral dilemma, each of you advise him/her as best you can. Then he/she gets to decide which course of action he/she takes - or, if by now the narration has gotten completely outlandish - which course he/she would have taken, were the checkout chick's bosoms truly decorated with diamonds as big as your fist and her eyes actually burned with the lust of a thousand Zeuses, and the conveyor belt for the shopping actually had a vibrate function.<br/><br/>When your host gets sick of you, he/she dies. That's a shame. Argue with the other Shoulder Person about where his/her soul ends up.

Follow the same track into the snow, out on a wide field, where you can spread out. Spread out in a large circle. Do not make a lot of tracks there, so follow in the footsteps of each other as far as it goes, in a large circle, until you have to make your own track to the place you will stand, in the circle. Make sure the circle is so large you have to shout to be hear each other. This is where you will play.<br/><br/>- 2 -<br/>Stay there.<br/><br/>- 3 -<br/>When you are ready; make up a fictional name and shout it to the others. Wait for the others to do this to.<br/><br/>- 4 -<br/>Shout where you come from. Say something of your immediate journey; how you came to stand here, in the deep snow. Let the others have their say too.<br/><br/>- 5 - <br/>Shout advice, proposals and speculations to the others, on the conundrum of why you are standing here, still, in the deep snow. Shout comments on the problems this gives you. You should be very concerned about any problems shouted by others too, and adopt those problems as your own. Everything may be wrong with standing still in the snow! The situation is really quite horrible!<br/><br/>- 6 -<br/>Make sure you do not solve the core problem (standing in the snow will kill you, if you do not move), and that you find no incitement to move. You will not, under no circumstance, move away from here. As play progresses, you understand that you will all die here.<br/><br/>- 7 -<br/>When you are ready, shout something to the effect that you can't stand it anymore (whatever "it" is), and start to die. Dying in this game is signified by sitting down in the snow (it's ok to bring a little something to sit on for the game), out of sight in the snow, for the others.

If everybody rolls a 5, roll again.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnybody that rolled a 6 is already hatched, and is omniscient.  Anybody that rolled under 5 is unhatched.  Play consists of maximum 5 rounds.  In the first round, any already-hatched players can argue with Mother about which eggs ought to be hatched, and which ought to be eaten or destroyed.  Any argument they put forth cannot be naysayed by anybody but somebody playing an Aspect of Mother sufficiently equipped to naysay.  If the argument isn't naysayed, it becomes canon.  In round 2, anybody that rolled a 4 hatches, unless they were eaten.  They can then join in the argument.  They can be equipped with up to 4 Senses, which will allow them to observe and naysay.  Same routine, down to round 1.

I have a vision of a guy who's part of a magic-using culture, but his deal with a Thought/Perception demon crippled his energy abilities.  He's also a very tall and wide guy who can't easily command spirits to transport him places.

Then, each player says something about the character to his left.  This must be an ipso facto statement based on the other player's statement.  EG:  "You say your character is a barista, that means she's a nympho."  As you can see by the example, your ipso facto statement doesn't need to make sense:  Rather, its internal logic is used to reveal a prejudice or belief held by your character.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe process is repeated for the character to each player's right.  This serves to lay a foundation for preconceptions held by each character about the other characters.

When they want to do something ridiculous and impossible in-game, they can cite points about their character to give them +1 or +2 on a d20 success roll.  They'll probably only get a 15 or 20 percent chance on this, if they argue their case well, but here's the cinch:  If the other players really want to see you succeed, they can invest Absurdity Tokens in the roll, each of which will give you +1.  So if you want to deflect arrows with your penis while standing on a racing camel and eating a Big Mac, well, you just need some support from your play-group, and you can make it happen!

That's your Morale. If someone frightens you, etc., they try to roll over your Morale. If you try to do something clever, craven or sneaky, you try to roll over your morale.<br/><br/>Choose a suit of armour. None (AC 8), Leather (AC 10), Chain (AC 12), Half-Plate (AC 14). If someone attacks you, etc., they try to roll over your AC. If you try to perform a stunt, depend on your agility or your endurance, you try to roll over your AC.<br/><br/>What sort of weapon do you have? None (roll 2d6 damage, take the lowest), One-handed (1d6 damage, and you can carry a shield, potion, etc.) or Two-handed (2d6 damage, take the highest)<br/><br/>You have 1 HD for every character level you have. You start at level 1. Each time you go up a character level, roll your HD in d6s to determine your hit points. If you roll lower than your current total, keep your current total.<br/><br/>Choose a name. For extra points, make it a contortion of your own name.<br/><br/>DUNGEON MASTERS LISTEN UP!<br/><br/>When the characters go into a dungeon, they'll be on the first level of the dungeon. Monsters on the first level of the dungeon are - wait for it - first level! So it's just like making a character. 'How big are this thing's claws?' 'Like greatsword size' '2d6-take-highest for damage, then'. 'How thick is this thing's hide?' 'Like leather' '10 AC then'<br/><br/>Treasure has to be split equally between every character in the party. For every 1 silver piece a character squanders in town, they get 1 XP. Level up at 1000 XP and then 3000 XP and then 6000 and you get the drill.<br/><br/>If a character is reduced to 0 hit points or below, they can either Bleed Out or go back to 1 HP with a Scar.<br/><br/>Bleed Out: Each round, the DM rolls against your Morale. If the DM wins, you gain 1d6 death points. At 10 death points, you die. If the DM fails his/her roll, you stabilise. A friend can help you out as their action in combat - you lose 1d6 death points (minimum 0).<br/><br/>HELLHOUND. Level 3. Teeth like daggers, breath like a greatclub but it needs to recharge (roll 1d6 each turn, needs 4-6). SCAR: Hellfire burns never properly heal, they always itch and occasionally burn.<br/><br/>----<br/><br/>So these ideas have been floating around in my head for a bit, and the game will only be coherent to people who know D&amp;D.

This is a game for those of you who want to learn more about the AIA series of contract documents.  You want to be an architect?  Well this is how you get sued into bolivia!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are three characters:<br/>\n<br/>\nThe Contractor, wants to make money by building the cheapest thing while charging overpriced change orders at every turn.<br/>\nThe Owner, wants to max out the awesomeness of the building, pay for none of it, and have it all done on time<br/>\nThe Architect, wants to survive to design another building<br/>\n<br/>\nStart with a small problem...and then constantly just escalate the situation until it all comes utterly falling apart.  After all, building project is nothing if not a comedy of errors.<br/>\n<br/>\nWith some thought I think I could make something amusing for us industry insiders at least...but I doubt that would be of much use for my GF while she studies for her architect exams!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_365169">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365169/#Comment_365169" name="Item_188" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-04T23:51:30+00:00" title="March  4, 2012 11:51PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Interesting!  So it seems like the Contractor and Owner are involved in a competitive game, where if the Architect doesn't add enough surplus value into the equation, one or both of them will be unhappy.  But if the Architect can optimally combine cheapness, awesomeness, and speed, then perhaps the Contractor and Owner might both be happy!  In which case the Architect might come out of it with some sort of career improvement.  Get paid more the next time if they can pull it off again?  Get more clients and thus wind up in a slightly better situation for the next job?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_365175">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365175/#Comment_365175" name="Item_189" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T00:31:09+00:00" title="March  5, 2012 12:31AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2012 1:23AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Jon and Justus: thanks for climbing out on the limb with us others, designing the games that brought this thread to <b>a hundred games!</b> For us to make a thread of 100 games, with nothing but the design-practice as our reward, is a remarkable feat, in my view. Every designer contributing to this has good reason to be proud. We are probably all a bit wiser for doing so. <br/><br/>Your games are fun to read. <br/><br/>Jon: maybe there should be only 1 king in each deck. It could end very fast if you have 4 kings in each deck.

Could make a great resource.<br/><br/>Also, you say you'd like to see a discussion of these games in the other thread. Do you just mean these games in general, or games in specific? For example, would you prefer to see my comments on CONTRACT DOCUMENTS! in the other thread?<br/><br/>Justus: I'm a law student and an interesting variation of your game could be with:<br/><br/>Prosecution, who is trying to make the situation as complicated as possible to help their client,<br/>Defence, who is trying to make the situation as complicated as possible to help their client, and<br/>Judge, who is trying to make the situation as simple as possible.<br/><br/>The way I imagine it working is you start with a simple legal situation: <br/><br/>A man rode his bike in the park despite the sign that said 'No vehicles'<br/><br/>And the prosecution would chime in: 'Yes, but the legislation says that "other modes of transportation" aren't vehicles!'<br/><br/>And the defence would say, 'Yes, but that was part of a larger phrase: "Horses, donkeys and other modes of transportation", so "other modes of transportation" must be limited to equines or animals!'<br/><br/>And the prosecution would say, 'Yes, but the sign was posted by a local government which has no constitutional power to impose criminal provisions,'<br/><br/>And the defence would say something, and so on.<br/><br/>Probably a game that could only be played by law students (and only law students would want to play it), but it could be a useful teaching tool. A lot of our education is based around hypotheticals; this game would produce an unlimited number of them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_365189">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/365189/#Comment_365189" name="Item_191" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-05T03:46:35+00:00" title="March  5, 2012  3:46AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 5, 2012 3:47AM by TomasHVM.">edited March 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Chris!

Its interesting, in practice as an Architect sometimes you feel like a tight coherent team with the Owner and Contractor, but sometimes it just falls apart and gets adversarial all around.  The idea of the architect as harried navigator between two competing interests is something I didn't really think about -- but given what I wrote in the initial post post it makes a lot of sense.  Funny how one's own ineloquence brings up fresh ideas!<br/>\n<br/>\nThere is also another way to look at the issue.  There is a famous triangle in our world called "speed-budget-quality...you get 2 out of 3".  In this sort of dance you can have the owner wanting his project fast, the contractor wanting it cheap, and the architect wanting it pretty.  Instead of having the architect as the central balancing force, maybe there is a way to get things to swing around back and forth as they search for equilbrium careening towards the completion of a project<br/>\n<br/>\nI don't know how I'd push it mechanically, I think I'd like to play more RPG's  before trying actively taking this idea further.  But I've always been interested in the mundane as the foundation for interesting art, and with your encouragement I'll definitely keep the pot boiling in the back of my head!  As the other 100 posts discussion bring up, ideas are cheap, execution is hard....but sometimes it is the spark of an idea that pushes one towards execution, and for that, Cheers! --Justus.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_371121">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes" title="Snake_Eyes"><img alt="Snake_Eyes" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Snake_Eyes">Snake_Eyes</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/371121/#Comment_371121" name="Item_193" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-04-04T05:48:38+00:00" title="April  4, 2012  5:48AM">April 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Judgement day 2 \u201cI told you so\u201d <br/><br/>everyone has six skills, hand-cuffs, a motorbike, and a bomb.
