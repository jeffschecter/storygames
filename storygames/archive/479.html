                    Over in the <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=476&amp;page=1" rel="nofollow">A Very Special Gender and Gaming Conversation</a> thread, Nancy said: <code>The only time I played a male character, everyone got confused because it was me playing it and I am not male.</code><br/>This made me think of my own gaming history. As I've mostly GMed, I've played lots of female NPCs. However, I'd say that about 75% of my PCs have been men. I'd also guess that about 65-70% of the PCs that get played in any game I'm in are the same gender as their player. <br/><br/>Of course this does mean that a good chunk of the time we do have people playing across gender, but I've noticed it also tends to cluster. We'll go for games at a time and have everyone playing same-gender characters, and then suddenly have a game where 75% of the players are playing different gender PCs. I think there is probably a bit of an avalanche effect, with folks sort of "getting permision" to do it by having one person start it off. After that, its open season. <br/><br/>When we do play across gender lines no one has ever had a problem with it, nor been weirded out -- even when it leads to IC romances that have different OOC gender lines. However, I don't think that I can say that there isn't any kind of issue to some of the play. Mo almost always plays a guy in Dogs in the Vineyard -- because she dislikes much of the nature of women's sin in the game and so avoids it by playing a male. Similarly, Joshua BishopRoby played a woman in my Dogs game because he wanted to deal with some issues from exactly those POVs. <br/><br/>So how about ya'll? Do you play members of the opposite gender? How does your group react to it? Or, if you don't, how do you think they would react to it? What about if it lead to you having an IC sexual involvement with a PC played by a person whose OOC gender is not your normal preference? How would you deal with it? How do you think your normal groups would? <br/><br/>(Which leads me to want to ask about straight GMs running romances for gay characters played by gay players, and similar gender crosses, but I'll leave that for another time.)                </div>

                            I'm playing a girl in a Fate fantasy game at the moment. It's just me and another player (the GM - a guy). <br/>
<br/>
When I recently ran a TSOY campaign, both players, my wife and a female friend of ours, played male characters. One of the PCs (not my wifes) became quite involved with a female NPC played by me, and though we never took it to a sexual level, a lot of romantic conflicts got played out.<br/>
<br/>
There was no discomfort whatsoever.                        </div>

                            I love me some genderbending.  Generally, I try to do it online where the verbal and nonverbal cues don't cause dissonance for the other players.<br/>
<br/>
Online, genderbending is normal to the point that players (or at least I) usually cease caring about the gender of the person on the other side of the screen -- but there are always exceptions.  One woman character I played had a blossoming relationship that was quite sweet get totally shut down when the other player asked and I readily answered that I was a guy.  Unfortunately, my enjoyment of the character was pretty much destroyed due to the sudden breach of continuity.<br/>
<br/>
...I actually can't even <i>remember</i> the last time I played a character of a female gender on tabletop.                        </div>

                            In tabletop, I almost always gender bend (about 75%?  Something like that.).  Why?  Probably because most characters I come up with quickly end up being female, and for obvious reasons I want to play the characters as I've concieved them.<br>
<br>
In LARPs, I tend not to, because costuming and such tends to be a bit tough (exception: Kat Millers LARP at Dexcon.  But that game didn't have costuming so, well, no problem).                        </br></br></div>

                            As an aside, when CthulhuPunk  +20 was running strong, we had 4 players playing at least two characters each, in tabletop.  The players were split 3/1 Female/Male (with Lisa Padol GMing).  Group 1 (less powerful, more local "band" group) stablized at 4 female characters.  Group 2 (more powerful, several of the characters dating from the original Cthulupunk game) was usually (things shifted a bit toward the end) 4 male characters.   So you might say we're all equal opportunity gender benders.                        </div>

                            I never play male characters if I can help it.  I more often than not have played in groups where the majority of players and the majority of characters have been male, and in the interest of seeing my gender represented in the game, I've played female characters.  I also like the idea that in a game I can have the women I play do things they wouldn't necessarily get the chance to do in real life.                        </div>

                            I play female characters at least a third of the time, maybe more.  Most all of my play is tabletop.  Interestingly I think some of the pattern got set in early teens gaming, when I was the only person willing to play a female character in an all male group.  So I'd have GM's lobby me to play a female.  Nowadays it's pretty much down to what character concept grabs my attention first.  I'll occasionally consider the gender of my last few characters and if they've all been the same, consciously decide to switch out.<br>
<br>
****<br/>
(Which leads me to want to ask about straight GMs running romances for gay characters played by gay players, and similar gender crosses, but I'll leave that for another time.)<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
Why wait?  One of the more interesting of my early play experiences was in Cyberpunk (1.0).  They had the random lifepath system as part of the character generation system, and I rolled gay as my sexual orientation.  So I decided to go with it.  I don't think I actually pointed this out to the GM, because fairly early on he tossed two "cool girlfriend NPCs" at the two male player/characters.  (the group, including GM, was three males, one female).  My character was quite friendly with his "designated girlfriend" NPC but played oblivious to all her advances.  This lead to what was actually a rather cool scene where he was taking her home on his motorcycle and they get into a huge argument, and it finally comes out that "yes, you are really nice and all but I don't like you THAT WAY".<br/>
<br/>
So the GM rolls with it and hooks me up with a "cool boyfriend" NPC.  And that went quite well, but I admit that playing out scenes of affection with my "cool boyfriend" did challenge my comfort zone at the time.  But I did it.  Definitely a personal growth kind of RP experience.                        </br></br></div>

                            I cross and play female characters maybe 30-40 percent of the time tabletop, and nearly 100 percent of the time online (though I'm very adamant about never attempting to conceal my RL gender).<br/>
<br/>
As far as in-game romances go, there have been some mild flirtations, and one settled marriage (the player playing my in-game spouse and I concieved of the characters as married in their backstory, so we kind of skipped over the courtship phase).  I'm not huge on roleplaying a lot of romance or sex, regardless of character gender, either tabletop or online.<br/>
<br/>
My gaming groups over the years have tended to have a fair number of women and a fair number of gay players, so gender bending has been common and not a problem.                        </div>

                            Okay, some general questions: <br/><br/>Joshua BishopTutakamenRoby -- Why don't you play female characters in table top? You talked about the "dissonance" thing, but is that all there is? Is it your dissonance, theirs, both? How much of this lines up with Nancy's statement that the folks at the table wouldn't buy her as a guy? <br/><br/>How would you feel if you were playing with your wife, Mo, and I (me as GM) and we decided we wanted an all female PC group. In that context how comfortable would you be playing a girl? How comfortable if it was me, you, Lem, and your brother? <br/><br/>Jess, I like that answer, very strongly and elegantly said. What, just to be difficult, would make you unable to help it? Have you ever felt preasured to play a male character? <br/><br/>Shreyas, does sex happen onscreen when you play male characters? What about romance? Any differences there? <br/><br/>Anders, rock on. Do you think it would have changed if sex had been involved? Do you ever have sex in your games, or is it more or less limited to romance? <br/><br/>Fred, GM? Tell me more of this GM! What was his problem? How did he deal with it? How did you deal with that? <br/><br/>Rafial (sorry, can't remember your real name ATM), that is an awesome Cyberpunk story. While you were pushing your boundaries, how did the others at the table deal with it? How much OOC talk was there about it? Between you and other players? You and the GM? If your GM had actually been gay, or a girl, or a space alien without gender, would it have changed anything? <br/><br/>Also, why were the GMs so hot to have female characters in the group? Most of my early D&amp;D days no one even thought about having girls in the group until we got female players. Being as this was the early 80s and Texas, at that point we just assumed they'd play girls. So what was going on in your group that lead to the desire? What kind of plots did they give you? How did the others in the game respond to it? <br/><br/>Joshua K, excellent descriptions. Do you know of other guys who are willing to play girls in LARP? Cross dress to do it? You said that costuming can be a pain -- how far in to that are you willing to talk about?<br/><br/>Len. Excellent responses. Have you always played in mixed orientation games, or has that changed over your time gaming? I know that I used to play with a lot of straight white Mormon boys, and now days play with every kind of queer orientation you can think of -- and I have noticed a big difference between the two groups in their willingness to use sex, crossed genders, and general gender bending in game. Have you had any similar, or opposite, experience?                        </div>

                            You know, all obvious patriarchal oppression aside, I think the world I live in is more accepting of a woman who's both badass and emotionally expressive than of a man in the same role. In that sense I have an easier time playing a well-rounded character who's a woman. Maybe Brokeback Mountain will do some good there, but rarely will you find a male character who's like Wolverine or something and then has a good cry. Guys are always 'angry.' Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's a huge problem with men. HUGE. Obviously it's my problem too. Maybe this weekend at FM I'll play a man who's both badass and teary eyed and see how it goes.                        </div>

                            I end up portraying female characters quite often, as I'm usually the GM and my games often have important female NPCs. I think I've only played a female character once, in a convention game.<br/>

                            Paul, I'd agree with that. Do you think your GMness and NPC girlness would change the way you played a PC girl or no? <br/><br/>Matt, What about men in other cultures? Or are you being all nasty and talking about the fact that all of us are gendered people in our culture IRL and so get stuck with the detrius of assumption even when playing men in a fictional society that says warriors can wear flowers, makeup, and have a good cry?<br/><br/>(The latter is, btw, one of the few problems I've had with Suryamaya playtests -- the idea that you can wear a dress, makeup, and flowers and still be the most feared warrior on earth just doesn't go over well with some guys. Can't imagine why.)<br/><br/>Shreyas, So for you gender just isn't important in RPing?                        </div>

                            Brand, the very first gaming group I was ever aware of (though I couldn't, for complex reasons, play with them for some time) had a female gm and 1 female player.  The first groups with gay players didn't happen till college.  All my groups have always had some ethnic/racial diversity, if only because I was in them and I'm black. :)  Part of it is just the luck of living in big coastal cities all my life, diverse populations of young people to interact with.  I reckon things would be tougher in other areas of the country.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it's roleplaying.  So getting to be not-yourself seems to me to be a big draw.  And eventually you want to try different not-me's besides "the not-me who is the big barbarian who doesn't have to be introspective", and "the not-me who is a super cool assassin-corporate troubleshooter-mercenary", etc, your classic power fantasies and such.  One day, "the not me who is a housewife with a kid and an herb garden and a bit of an alchemy/herbology business on the side" seems kind of interesting.  Or "the not me who is a Susan Powter/Camille Paglia/Ayn Rand-esque mildly irritating inspirational speaker/writer".                        </div>

<code>Why don't you play female characters in table top? You talked about the "dissonance" thing, but is that all there is? Is it your dissonance, theirs, both? How much of this lines up with Nancy's statement that the folks at the table wouldn't buy her as a guy? How would you feel if you were playing with your wife, Mo, and I (me as GM) and we decided we wanted an all female PC group. In that context how comfortable would you be playing a girl? How comfortable if it was me, you, Lem, and your brother?</code><br/><br/>Online, all the players trade is information -- ones and zeroes, mostly text, maybe an occasional image (drawn or photoshopped pics).  In tabletop, there is also a performance aspect that cannot be separated from the performer and the performer's physicality.  Online, if my character does something effete, she appears feminine; in tabletop, if I play my character effete, I look effete, and I suspect the character doesn't appear anything, since me and my goatee acting effete are more interesting than my character at that point.  Certainly this has just as much to do with how the rest of the table sees me and understands my character as it does with how I believe the rest of the table sees me and understands my character.  Or, to put it in a lot fewer words, online play gives me more masking techniques.<br/><br/>You, me, Mo, Laura, playing Powerpuff Girls... well, then it's a gag, mostly.  If we were for some reason trying to do it in all seriousness -- playing Emily's not-quite-Geisha game or something, I suppose -- then it's part and parcel of the experience, and there's less expectation of me and my goatee being a believable girl.  Really, it's not much difference than the gag scenario.  Me playing a girl is sort of the point, then.  I don't think it's much different when I'm playing among all-guys or mixed, either.<br/><br/>I think it's at least partially a flagging issue.  When I'm in a game that constrains me to play a woman, I'm not flagging anything by playing a woman any more than I'm flagging something when I play a Starfleet officer in a Star Trek game.  When I'm in a game that does not constrain me to play a woman and I choose to do so, there's a reason that I choose to do so.  Here's me not blathering on for pages about bisexuality and transexuality.  Suffice to say, I find gender to be a fascinating divide, one that is both significant and superficial (and at the same time!).  I can't explore that divide in a fictional context when the act of roleplaying highlights my own, real-life context.  Unless I want to experience the RPG equivalent of a Rodin sculpture.<br/><br/>Am I making <em>any</em> sense whatsoever?                        </div>

You can say that again. This is part of the difficulty I have with portraying female characters. When is the fact that she's a woman important? When is it not? How do make my portrayals realistic without being patronizing or stereotyped?<br/><br/>--Paul                        </div>

                            Dude, when I'm the GM I play tree-people animated by the power of imagination.  There's a lot less expected of the GM in terms of verisimilitude.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, when I GM I'm very rarely interested in exploring the situation of the NPCs I play.  NPCs are tools to create situation for the player characters.  NPCs are hand puppets.  If I get too into an NPC, that's a red flag that I probably need to back off that character lest I try to hijack the game pursuing an element that nobody but me cares about.  (Either that, or I make them into a PC elsewhere -- hello, Elektra).                        </div>

                            Joshua, <br/><br/>Excellent responses. So since you are so smart I will continue to bother you. <br/><br/>What about RPing a tree-person animated by the power of imagination? I mean you seem to be assuming that the standard PC is a human(ish) and gendered construct... do your answers change when dealing with people playing bodiless Doyen in the 31st century who are post-singularity creatures dealing with the flux cycle of time travel? How tightly is situation exploration tied to gender, flagging, and the "I'm playing a human" issue? Do you flag your TOSY goblin differently based on gender, or once you aren't human anymore does gender matter less? <br/><br/>Um, the other questions are about methods of GMing and NPC interaction, but don't have to do with gender so I'll save them for another time.                        </div>

                            Firstly, do I need to review the distinction between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_sex" rel="nofollow">sex</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity" rel="nofollow">gender</a>?  I'm going to assume not, but if I stop making sense, somebody say something and I'll 'splain.<br/><br/>TSOY goblins are gendered -- they just only have one, and it is contrasted with other species.  Your bodiless 31st century meshuggenah is... probably gendered, inasmuch as he's created by a gamer mired in a gendered world.  I mean, how many foxy discorporal AIs has the world seen in movies?  If it's really important to you to play a nongendered character, then I think that says something flaggy all on its own, but to answer the specific question, I doubt I'd have much of a problem playing (or trying to play) such a character.<br/><br/>Gender is a potent flag for creating and relating to situation.  Consider the hierarchy of story drivers (Sex, Violence, Religion, Money, and Family) and how gender relates to every single item on the list.  The genders that we are most familiar with are human genders; when nonhuman genders appear in a game they are typically used, Star Trek alien-like, to comment on the human genders that actually matter to us because we deal with them every day.                        </div>

<p>Brand, this is a fascinating discussion.</p>
<p>For me, I deemphasize gender deliberately. I feel like it is too caught up in agendas and exaggerated reactions in the real world, and I don't want those agendas to turn into bad blood when someone makes a stink while I am trying to have fun and play a game.</p>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>So how does that stack against Josh's statement about how Sex, Violence, Religion, Money, and Family all have (in our culture at least) gendered associations? Do you use those, but downplay the gender associations? And what if that offended someone? For example in another thread JD pointed out that for him the word "macho" is not something abstract, and has to do with cases of real abuse he sees every day in real life. So what if I played a game for him in which I stripped out those associations in order to keep someone from getting upset -- might that not upset him? <br/><br/>(Sorry for taking your name in vain JD, I'm not really talking about you.) <br/><br/>Or to not use JD as an example -- when I was playtesting a historical India game back in the day, I had stripped out some cultural issues between Tamils and Sinahlese in order to not be politically offensive. When I went to playtest one of my players was Tamil, and he ended up getting pissed because I had taken out the part that mattered to him. <br/><br/>Which brings up another question for everyone: <br/><br/>Do you like it when games stip gender/sex from their "things that matter?" Does it bother any of the women when they're expected to act like boys with breasts? Or any of the guys when they're told that gender doesn't matter, only to have everyone look at them odd when their character freely expresses emotionality? Do you find that games can succesfully take out gender elements, or does it just shift the discourse onto another level?<br/><br/>Josh, <br/><br/>Are you being sneaky again and saying that the stories we tell with non-human genders actually have to do with the way humanity relates to gender? <br/><br/>But even if you are, how does that stack up against the question I asked up top -- do you play other genders? (Yes, I said opposite. I was hoping someone would call me on it. "Whats the opposite of gay?" No dice.) <br/><br/>Or is it only other sexes that weird us? <br/><br/>Actually, this one should go back to everyone: If your group is/is not okay with you playing a member of the opposite sex, how do you think/know they would react to you playing a different gender (playing gay, lesbian, a transexual, a goblin who switches sexes around)? How would you feel about it yourself?                        </div>

                            Brand, I'm going to steal one of those questions.  It doesn't bother me that people expect female characters to be boys with breasts.  It bothers me when they expect that and then say "of course she's not as good as we men" when you botch a roll or lose a contest.  I don't mind the lack of sterotypes; you're on a quest or something tromping through the woods -- of course you're not going to be wearing a dress and complaining about bugs (unless you've specifically envisioned your character that way).  But then again, I'm rather practical when it comes to these sorts of things.<br/>
<br/>
For the group that was perpetually confused when i played a male character, I don't think they'd have any problems with my playing a lesbian or other-gendered character.  In another group (playing Burning Wheel) I played a lesbian and it was a non-issue.  Mind, these were both pretty liberal groups as a whole so that probably contributed.<br/>

If you're a girl who has sexual orientations other than the norm it isn't an issue, its something else that causes the confusion.

<p>Yeah, I use those things. And I do tend to unconsciously ignore gender associations. They fly right under my radar and I don't engage in them. If someone tried to get in my face about them, I'd probably disengage with the game and just stop right there. It's not something I want to deal with and I don't care who I offend by not doing so. That's how I roll. I'm not interested in it being a "thing that matters" and people in my games that make it such are raining on my parade.</p>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>Cool. I'll have to ponder more, I have more questions for you -- but at this point they aren't all about gender. <br/><br/>Nancy, <br/><br/>Right... um... let me find what I was talking about. Josh BishopTutakenkamun said: <code>In tabletop, there is also a performance aspect that cannot be separated from the performer and the performer's physicality. Online, if my character does something effete, she appears feminine; in tabletop, if I play my character effete, I look effete, and I suspect the character doesn't appear anything, since me and my goatee acting effete are more interesting than my character at that point. Certainly this has just as much to do with how the rest of the table sees me and understands my character as it does with how I believe the rest of the table sees me and understands my character. Or, to put it in a lot fewer words, online play gives me more masking techniques.</code><br/>And I was thinking that your comment about them getting "confused" might fit in there somewhere. When you, obviously female are sitting there at the table being obviously female but playing a guy, there is a lot of cognitive dissonance going on in the heads of the folks playing with you. They are seeing a woman, and getting the social codes of a woman, but being told information about a boy. So it creates a sense of disconnection between the character and the player, and results in some general confusion. <br/><br/>Sound about right? <br/><br/>Now, a question for folks who don't have that problem Ã¢â‚¬â€œ why don't you? Did you ever have it and overcame it? Do some players have it and others not? Does it depend on who is playing? In other words, do you think it has to do with acting talent, ability to suppress gender codes, ability to separate character and player, all of that? More than that? Less than that?                        </div>

                            Yes, Brand, I think that was exactly what was going on.  And while there's a part of me that really wishes I could pull it off, that I could play a male character every once in a while, I'm choosing to stick to female characters (though they may be extremely masculine) to avoid that confusion.<br/>

                            Brand: While I (more often than not) play women in tabletop, I generally -don't- play them in LARPs.  Why?  Partially because most LARPs I play are pre-cast, so while in tabletop I'm answering "what do you want to play", in LARPs I'm answering questions like "what gender are you" and letting the GMs handling casting.  But even aside from that, I'm not amazingly eager to play women in LARPs, because unlike a tabletop, people -do- take their cue from what you're wearing and what you look like in a LARP -- so to portray a female chracter reasonably requires cross-dressing, something I'm not amazingly comfortable with.  (for similar reasons, I tend to play same-gender in the large, rotating game group I'm loosely involved in, since that group is more liikely to forget what gender you're actually playing than not).  That said, playing a female character in Kat's Everway LARP was fine -- it was a small group of players (8), the character pictures were on the badges (a -big- help!), and since nobody was costumed, I didn't feel out of place.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen players playing cross-gender in LARPs before, though -- Lisa played my father in Appalachian Wedding (who was, in turn, cross-dressing as a woman), and another player, Q, played the same character when we helped run the game at Columbia.  And I can think of several other examples..  With one exception  (the tribal shamaneess in the run of Miscatonic Archeological Expedition I played in), these were all women crossing (and cross-dressing) as men -- which is much less conditioned against.                        </div>

<code>It bothers me when they expect that and then say "of course she's not as good as we men" when you botch a roll or lose a contest.</code><br/><br/>If you're playing FLFS and you take the Thematic Battery "Lady Officer" or the like, the other players get XP for saying such things.  Of course, if you don't take an applicable Thematic Battery, they don't.<br/><br/><code>Do you like it when games stip gender/sex from their "things that matter?" ... Do you find that games can succesfully take out gender elements, or does it just shift the discourse onto another level?</code><br/><br/>It depends on implementation, for me.  Gender is a non-issue in most Star Trek games, mostly because Star Trek is sterile and genderless in lots of not actually very good ways.  But in terms of stripping out gender, Star Trek works -- at least for me.  On the other hand, I think Blue Rose did a pretty good job of recontextualizing a lot of gender issues -- I'm a firm believer that the folks who got squicked got squicked not because it dealt with gender issues clumsily, but that it dealt with gender issues at all.<br/><br/>On the other hand, "boys with breasts" is a terribly apt description of a lot of other games.<br/><br/><code>Are you being sneaky again and saying that the stories we tell with non-human genders actually have to do with the way humanity relates to gender?  But even if you are, how does that stack up against the question I asked up top -- do you play other genders?</code><br/><br/>I play lots and lots of other genders.  I play those 'furthest' from me online; I play those 'closer' in tabletop.  A man in Dogs is in very real ways a different gender than the modern man that I am, but I've also played very straight, womanizing, modern men in tabletop, too.<br/><br/><code>Or is it only other sexes that weird us?</code><br/><br/>Here's the thing about playing same-sex differently-gendered -- lots of players don't even notice.  Especially in short games, there's often not that much opportunity to express anything with any amount of subtlety, which gender often is.  Actually, it's a lot like people's assumptions at work -- I wear a wedding ring, that means I'm totally straight as an arrow, right?  And because you aren't the only one that characterizes your character in play, sometimes the rest of your playgroup will 'turn' you straight modern american man when in fact you were interested in going a different direction.  That can't happen when I'm sitting at the table playing a woman.                        </div>

                            I think a lot of the problem some male players playing female characters is the need to play them as "effite".  I don't, and I don't have problems -- whether I'm playing a wolf-girl, a shapechangng (but more female than male) shadow, a drug-abuse recovering mother and witch (and, eventually, crow shamaness), a socialite turned costumed vigilante turned mayoral hopeful, or a frustrated 30 year old child, my characters aren't "effite".  They may be feminine, but that comes across in how they act, how they dress, and how I describe them, not in coming across trying to "act like a womean" -- which in my experience, tends to work less well.                        </div>

                            Joshuas, <br/><br/>Thanks. Good stuff there. Especially about the oddness of cross-dressing and LARP. <br/><br/>Joshua Tutekamen, <br/><br/>I'd disagree about only one point: I don't think Trek is genderless. Riker never made out with Picard, but he did hit it up with half the female cast. Ditto John Kim's comments about why sex in fan fic vis a vis Spock and Kirk, not to mention Kirks aggressive maleness in bagging every space woman that set foot on the ship. (And then proving that he just screws them but doesn't love them when he chooses his ship over the alien princess with the love-producing tears.) <br/><br/>I think Trek just has a particularly watered down and sometimes noxious version of a standard white-bread gender-bias that allows it to pass as being genderless. <br/><br/>Joshua K, <br/><br/>In your table top games how much of characteriziation is made up by acting? I know that at my table I do much of my work by verbal description and syntactic tricks -- I'm not much of an actor. OTOH, some of my players are formally trained actors and bring physicality and "real acting" into the picture. As a result any game I'm in can be anywhere across the spectrum from virtual LARP to joint storytelling with no one directly representing the characters. Do you think this "level of representation" issue ties in with your methods?                        </div>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>Word. <br/><br/>Although, because I am Janus, I must now be two-faced and give an anecdote. <br/><br/>I have, betimes, made the mistake of taking fiction-writing classes of various stripes. At a fairly early stage in one of my classes I had to do the writer-workshop crap of handing out copies of a story to my peers to get feedback. Because of an error on my part, my name was not on the story. Because of an error on the prof's part on the schedule, everyone in the class thought the story belonged to the girl next to me. The next class everyone came in, handed in their written responses, and then had it cleared up that the story was mine. <br/><br/>The biggest response that I got from people looking at me was that my female narrator didn't sound much like a girl. Almost everyone in the class said this. Then when I get home I read the responses from when they didn't know I'd written it and they'd almost all talked about how strong and female my narrator was, and how they admired that kind of strong female voice. <br/><br/>So yeaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦                        </div>

<code>I don't think Trek is genderless.</code><br/><br/>Dude, <em>Trek</em> isn't genderless; Trek <em>gaming</em> is genderless, at least in my experience.  Sure, Kirk and Riker were sexy beasts and Picard and Beverly had their impossible love and all that stuff, but I have never seen anything even remotely similar in an actual Trek <em>game</em>.                        </div>

                            Brand: We describe actions.  Almost without exception, we act out conversations.  So I thnk that amounts to "a lot" -- even aside from some notable solo sessions Lisa and I have had, or sessions with Lisa and Beth and I, where nothing happened -except- for conversation and its immediate results (often with accompanying revelation and planning), we tend to do a lot of "just talking."  So I don't think so -- I think we're just very comfortable with not tying the manner of the person portraying the character -too- closely with the actual characters's manner, and with taking small hints and expanding them a bit to fill in the personality (we don't do a lot of accents either -- so maybe that's "a little", but if so only a little).                        </div>

                            I'm very bi when it comes to character gender.  Off the top of my head, about half of my all-time-favorite characters were male (Giigor, Axel, Antony) and half were female (Khoyaa, Dr. Tran, Princess Borga of Pict House Bork).  Only one of the men was 'gay' - it was more of a <i>Brokeback Mountain</i> kind of slow-simmering passion, really.  Very ahead of its time.<br/><br/>I've never felt any dissonance, and I actually revel in making other people uncomfortable at the gaming table, so I don't *care* if it caused dissonance for other people when I played a female character.  I had a really good environment for this sort of thing - well, actually it was the group of low-level incestual tension and there was a lot of meta-romance/sexual strangeness that went on ... so what happened in the game wasn't that big a deal.<br/><br/>Very liberating.                        </div>

                            Brand: Terrific thread!<br/>
<br/>
Josh B-R: Could it be that your comfort level as a GM playing NPC's is less about expectations of verisimilitude and more an issue of authority, pressure and necessity? (I.e. you have to play girls as s GM, so you are less self-conscious about them, feel like they have more of a right to be a girl product from you because you're the GM?)<br/>
<br/>
Shreyas: So if I were in a game with you and wanted to play with gender as a theme, you would check out of the game?<br/>
<br/>
Matt W: Asutue, honest and sensitive observation. Bravo.<br/>
<br/>
Nancy: I am boggled by your experience (no intent at all to invalidate it, it's just so *different* than mine!)<br/>
<br/>
And Brand already knows all of this, but I thought I'd throw it in for variance and discussion:<br/>
<br/>
I've played all over the genderbending world. I've played girls, I've played boys, I've played gay, straight, bi and poly. I've played characters that lived in drag, and have a character in creation now that is posthumanist and omnigendered. I've romanced and sexed in both genders characters of both genders and characters of players of both genders.  I've played both genders online, in TT, and in LARP. I've had a character in love with a hermaphrodite. I even once played a lesbian that was for a short time, magically  transformed into a man, and fell in love with her best friend  who was a gay male transvestite (and who's player was a decidedly gay man) who had at the same time also been magically transformed into a woman (the attraction continued, fitfully, painfully, after both had been returned to their natural state - it sounds convoluted, and it was, but it was also serious, and moving, and hard). <br/>
<br/>
Writing all that down at once, it becomes quite the litany <br/>
<br/>
I guess you could say: I'm versed in the genderfuck. It's fascinating, and it's a deeply emotional playground.                        </div>

                            Paul, you said: <code>This is part of the difficulty I have with portraying female characters. When is the fact that she's a woman important? When is it not? How do make my portrayals realistic without being patronizing or stereotyped?</code><br/>So, a question: if we can play psionic elves made of energy from the 31st and 1/2 century without a blink, why does playing a member of the opposite sex cause us such trauma? And I don't even mean in terms of the difficulty of portayal -- Josh and Nancy already did an admirable job dealing with that. I mean why does it lead us to questions like this? Why the tension? Why the concern? <br/><br/>Paul, would you have the same issues playing a gay man? Or a straight man of a different race? Is it just the tension of playing an other that actually exists against whom you might be compared? Would it change if you were playing in a group of all girls? A group with no girls? Playing a Thai man with a group that had never met anyone of Thai descent? <br/><br/>--<br/><br/>So far as actually being helpful, my best stab at it is this: be honest. <br/><br/>Which isn't an easy answer at all, though it looks like one. All you have to do is be honest with yourself about how you feel about women, their role in society, and your relationship to them. Do that and you will say something interesting about women and your relationship to them. <br/><br/>Of course, it could be interesting as in "May you live in interesting times" but hey...                        </div>

<p>Possibly! It really depends on whether you're aggressively forcing me to make my input into the game into a gender issue to interact with your input or not.</p>
<p>I'll check out if I'm feeling backed into a corner, but it's fairly likely that if you leave me an opportunity and don't force it then I'll take it. (In thinking about your question I'm starting to guess that what I'm reacting to here is aggressive issue-pushing and not to any issue in particular.)</p>

What about games that have plots that have political gender issues, or if a character in the game wants to play the gender fuck? Will you shy away from it if they're not pushing issues, but opening up avenues and paths of exploration?                        </div>

                            Responding to the questions that are now way way up there ^^^<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;While you were pushing your boundaries, how did the others at the table deal with it? How much OOC talk was there about it? Between you and other players? You and the GM?<br/>
<br/>
Very little as I recall.  I seem to remember there being a moment when the GM *got it* when he sort of stopped and said "uh, okay, are you sure you want to go there" and I said yes, and then we moved on.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;If your GM had actually been gay, or a girl, or a space alien without gender, would it have changed anything?<br/>
<br/>
I don't actually think so.  I'm very fond of slipping into actor stance, and I typically have a very strong mental image of the scene that I'm acting out, and project myself into the scene.  So simply holding a mental image of myself being physically affectionate with another male was moderately uncomfortable for me.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Also, why were the GMs so hot to have female characters in the group? Most of my early D&amp;D days no one even thought about having girls in the group until we got female players.  So what was going on in your group that lead to the desire?<br/>
<br/>
We had an interesting arc.  Originally, I only had a few friends who gamed, and all the modules were for "6-8 characters of n to n+3 levels", so we all ran stables of characters.  And some were male and some were female.  It was all very pawn stance... "Elena Half-Elven strikes the orc with her sword, while Mezzo Forte casts magic missile at the one behind it".  And as our characters leveled up and aged, we started marrying them off.  All very dispassionately, "My cleric marries your ranger, let's roll up their kids".  We even got a second generation into play.<br/>
<br/>
Then at some point we had enough people to do it "the right way" and have one character one player, and character identification set in, and that was it for female characters.  Only I think the GM's had gotten used to the presence of female PCs, and so felt there "ought" to be some.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;What kind of plots did they give you?<br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough, it was never anything different.  I mean, all our plots at this point were "go to point B and get the dingus".  In fact the main guy who I remember lobbying me to play a female character typically ran these game where the mine cart was firmly bolted to the rails, and we rode from one ueber NPC to another, faced an opponent who could crush us without blinking, and then at the last moment huzzah, we are saved by one of the ueber NPCs.  So PCs didn't get plots, PCs were window dressing and amusing color :/<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;How did the others in the game respond to it?<br/>
<br/>
"Huh huh.  You're playin' a GIRL..."                        </div>

                            Hmm.  I was going to say that maybe a quarter to a third of my PCs are female, but if I look over my <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/campaigns/pcs.html" rel="nofollow"><b>PCs from extended campaigns</b></a>, it's more like 1/8th.  Perhaps it has increased recently.  I played a female PC twice in the four convention slots that I played in at the April Fool's mini-con.  <br/><br/>I've been in a Buffy game that I'm currently co-GMing, where I play the local Slayer, <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/buffy/siliconvalley/maincast.html" rel="nofollow">Dot Comisky</a>.  Since late in Season One she's been in a long-term lesbian relationship with another PC, and they recently had a child, conceived by sorcerous means.  The other player is a lesbian woman, for what it's worth.  <br/><br/>Gender is definitely an issue in the games I play in -- particularly so in Buffy where it's a strong thematic element.  Most recently, Dot has been dealing with the problem of being a Slayer and having a baby by her partner Max casting a duplication spell where she can split into different selves: her super-strong fighty self, and her sensitive mommy-self.  Thus she can go and fight evil without neglecting her child.  <br/><br/>I think there are a few times when it's uncomfortable, and we're aware of it -- but mostly we enjoy the game of pretend.  I'm thinking particularly of recently when we had a body-switching episode plot.  In that plot, Madeline was the player of Carlos the PC, and I was GM, playing his NPC ex-girlfriend Laney -- but they ended up switching bodies.  So now we have Madeline playing a man in a woman's body (Carlos-in-Laney), and me playing Laney-in-Carlos.  And they had sex and got back together again while switched, but then didn't switch back to their original bodies even after the spell dropped.                        </div>

<p>Hm. At this point we're kinda wafting out into theory-land, into which place I don't go. Can you couch these in the language of specific examples?</p>
<p>My guess is that I have some threshold at which issue-discussion and pretend-game and story-game and <em>game</em> separate, and I only like three of those in my roleplayin'. If I can't sustain the bits I do like, then I'm not gonna stick around.</p>

                            Bit of a late answer here, Brand ...<br/>
<br/>
<i>Anders, rock on. Do you think it would have changed if sex had been involved? Do you ever have sex in your games, or is it more or less limited to romance?</i><br/>
<br/>
The last  two games I ran had some strong romantic content.<br/>
<br/>
I began gaming again only very recently, after a long break. My games prior to the break never had any sex or romance in them.<br/>
<br/>
I think that if the TSOY game had come to include any sexual content it would've been off-screen. But I think it would have stayed within everybody's comfort zone, and agreed upon before narrated.<br/>
<br/>
When we set up that game, there was some squirming (on the players part) because of TSOY's stated focus on romance and rules invoving sex and friendship. When came time for pool refreshments, buying new Keys and calling for conflicts though, those were the very themes adressed.                        </div>

                            Someone asked me about the GM who prohibited cross-gender play.<br>
<br>
His justification wasn't that he had a hangup about gender (perish the thought) but that he believed that people were better at RPing their own gender than the opposite.<br>
<br>
I responded by playing a gay working-class gearhead punk-rock anarchist.<br>
<br>
The only thing I had in common with the PC was that he's male.  The GM didn't have any problem with any of that.<br>

Funny that.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>To belatedly answer Ben's first post:</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Do you play members of the opposite gender?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Of course. Later even more than usual. I think that if I were to sum up every character I ever played the female/male ratio would be around 50-50, with the scales probably tipping to the opposite side. Contrary to this, I have never played any character who was openly homosexual. A priest adept with high sensibilities and impeccable taste in clothing, yes. A Verbana virgin(!) witch whose company was sought by many women, yes. But it never had the chance to come out in-game.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>How does your group react to it?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I have no group these days. However the 2 longer-lived groups I was in didn't think of it as such a big deal. The first group I ever was in used to joke about how another player was always playing half-elven female cleric/mages. Didn't faze him, as it was all in good humor. Gender roles didn't play more than a mechanical part, even when PCs got in sexual/relationship stuff. Said stuff was quite variable, actually: infatuation, wooing, rape (by a doppelganger), pregnancy, marriage, childbirth, even a mid-sex "black widow" scenario... also, most of these things weren't very much acted out, they just "happened" in game through some author-director stance combo. Maybe our 19-year-old selves weren't feeling comfortable acting it out? Maybe it was just a "that's how stuff happens, but it's not what we came to play for, so we give it lip service" mentality? I don't quite know why we engaged these things on this level, or <em>at all</em>. I now realize I went way off-topic, but I'll leave it here as an anecdote.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>What about if it lead to you having an IC sexual involvement with a PC played by a person whose OOC gender is not your normal preference? How would you deal with it? How do you think your normal groups would?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I normally need to feel very comfortable with the person I'm playing with for this to happen. And have an understanding that it's ok to create such a situation. <em>Only</em> then, it might happen. I believe that RPGs are, among other things, a way to express yourself and experiment imaginatively in a "safe" environment. But the game environment is not "safe" enough, in itself. Not for me. Everything my character does is in essence some kind of fantasy (using the tamer meaning of the word here) born of me, and if I'm passionate enough about it, then it might seem like it is really "me", or at least some inner self "leaking out". I feel that this (as well as other things which aren't the issue here) would make some people uncomfortable. Kindof removing The Veil or pushing The Line.</p>
<p>Which is weird, because if I had any homosexual fantasies, I so wouldn't act them out in a game. For me sexual fantasies are private affairs, either to be openly shared with a like-minded person, and/or acted out, and/or be kept to myself and confined to daydreaming. I believe acting those out under the guise of a game, without any prior understanding between the parties involved, breaks trust between people.</p>
<p>But here I am, thinking the worse of people. The last two paragraphs assume that others will see my roleplaying as an attempt to play out my sexual fantasies. Well, I kindof believe people are mostly playing out some of their fantasies in roleplaying games anyway. Why some fantasies are a cause for concern more than others? Maybe maturity issues. Maybe the importance of those issues to us and our society. Maybe something else which I cannot put into words yet.</p>

I, too, find this thread wicked fascinating.  To answer a later question first, I think that it's harder to play cross-gender than to play a space elf because there's nothing to compare your space elf portrayal to, and it's hard for people to tell you it's inauthentic or unacceptable.  Also, you rarely have to play a space elf whilst sitting across the table from an actual space elf who's going to look at you funny if you don't do it right.  I think for the same reason it's harder to play a character from a different (actually existing) race.<br/>
<br/>
And then, to go up a ways, yes, I have been in the position of having to play a male character.  Not long term, although I have turned down invitations to games because the context (historical military, Jesuit spies) pretty much preferred, if not necessitated, a male character.  <br/>
<br/>
In the short term, I've been handed male NPCs to play out for short scenes, flashbacks, whatever, and I usually shut down and just don't contribute to those scenes.  It seems to me that I'm pretty open about my preferences, and when somebody ignores them by only offering male characters to choose from, or specifically assigning me a male character, I get pissed.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as I'm thinking about it, I've never been in the reverse situation, where somebody makes all female characters to choose from, or where some condition (a haarem, Carmelite nun spies) preferred or necessitated female characters.                        </div>

                            Rafial, <br/><br/>Thanks! That's fascinating stuff, and not just for the gender issue. The change from pawn stance to character identification, and the reaction of the players changing due to a gendered character being the focus of identification are all some rich material. <br/><br/>John, <br/><br/>Oh yea, BuffyÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ but you're getting ahead of me again! I will have more questions for you later. <br/><br/>Anders, <br/><br/>Excellent information, thanks! It sounds like your group, after an initial weirdness, was pretty happy with TSOY for letting you tackle romance and sexual themes without actually having to have sex onscreen or having romance dominate the game. Is that a fair assessment? <br/><br/>Also, as you're sounding very interesting Mr Gone and Back Again, how does the "switch" in your gaming before and after your long break feel to you? Are you happier with the romance and (veiled, off-screen) sex in the game? Does it give you anything in game you didn't have before? Is there anything with gender relations in game you've wanted to do, but haven't been able to yet? <br/><br/>Fred, <br/><br/>Yea, that's funny. But not funny ha-ha. Thanks for the response!<br/><br/>Jason, <br/><br/>That is indeed a good anecdote. You also made me realize that in all my many years as a GM I have never RPed a woman in labor. The only labor I've ever run on screen was for a female PC run by a female player, and she ended up narrating about 85% of what happened. Of course, I don't have kids of my own or that might have changed. <br/><br/>But yea, that's a telling point about me isn't it? For all the sex and children and family in my games, the process of labor Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which is most certainly big fodder for just about every agenda Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is something I do off screen. Huh. <br/><br/>MarK, <br/><br/>Brand, not Ben. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> <br/><br/>As for the sexual fantasies issue, I'd posit that there are different kids of sexual fantasies. There are those that we normally hear when we think of the term, about the kinds of sex we'd like to have to get us off, and then there are the kind that are more complicated. In a very real way movies like Desperado or Dangerous Liaisons are "sexual fantasies" writ large, in which the point isn't the sexual excitement but the engagement through sexual focus. <br/><br/>The second kind is what I normally run: games with lots of sex and blood and family and all the rest of that stuff. When you put it in that context the sex in the game isn't erotica (though it can come close), it is an intensifier. It may well be connected to people's real sexual issues (probably should be, come to think of it) but it isn't just erotic. <br/><br/>Though it's probably worth noting that I have run games in which erotic interest was a definite element. Mostly online or in one-on-one games, but I've had one group in which we did it in a group context without problems. I agree with you though that such takes a HUGE level of safety Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and much of the time just a game with your friends isn't safe enough for that. <br/><br/>So, tell me, is there any situation in which you can see yourself being safe and comfortable enough with the person/people you're playing with to actually use sex and gender in an erotic way? Or is that just right out? <br/><br/>Jess, <br/><br/>I was just thinking the same: I've seen lots of games that used historical situation to force all male games, but damn few all female games. I've some friends playing City of the Moon who are, by constraint of the game, all female Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but that's the only such game I can ever remember anyone actually playing. Interesting, no? <br/><br/>As for the "real woman vs. fake space elf" issue Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I very much think your answer is part of it. Thus the questions about playing other cultures, and playing other cultures if there isn't a member of that culture around to correct you. I got this one myself, with my India fixation I've occasionally had chances to play in games set in India with Indian players Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and I can tell you that my level of self-consciousness did shoot WAY up. OTOH, when there weren't Indian players in the game I didn't give it a second thought. (I also later found out that they were intimidated by me, because I knew so much about Indian history that they didn't know themselves. Silly, isn't it? So silly it made me feel like a running imperialist dog.) <br/><br/>However, I think that sword has another edge. I know people who hesitate to play ancient Egyptians, not because there aren't any around anymore to tell you that you're doing it wrong, but precisely because there aren't enough around to let you know you're doing it right. For S based thinkers having data is important, and its hard to think of something most of us have more data about than sex, sexuality, and gender. You'd think it would be something we're all experts on, given how much time we spend interacting with it. But yet, it doesn't work that way at all, does it? <br/><br/>I mean if some of us are playing to deal with situation, and theme, and issues of emotionality, humanity, and all that crazy Nar stuff that folks like Josh and Ben and Vincent talk about (or that John brings up about his Buffy game above)Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ then isn't playing the thing that you really can judge and be judged by a thing to consider? Isn't there some degree to which we could use it as a learning opportunity? Lean across the table to the girl and say, "Do you think I'm being honest about that? Did that seem like something women you know would do?" I know I've seen people do things like that to Indian players in my India gamesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ so why can't we do it with members of other genders and different sexes?<br/><br/>Edit PS: That whole last section may sound preachy. It honestly isn't meant to be -- its a big giant question in my head that I was trying to poke with a stick to see what would come out. I mean the quetions I ask honestly.                        </div>

                            Shreyas, <br/><br/>Okay, specific examples time: We are playing a HeroQuest game in Lunar land. You're playing a Lunar guy who is all about "the goddess accepts everything and everyone". Mo is playing a Dara Harappan virago woman who is trying to join a cult that only accepts men as members -- defying 10,000 years of tradition. She comes to you for help, saying that if men and women are equal in the goddesses eyes, then this cult is wrong and she'd like you to try and help her get them to change their ways. Furthermore she argues that she isn't really a woman anyway, as she has given her life to battle and sworn not to have children -- which are how the Dara Harappan's define womanhood. She did this because she believed in the words of the Lunar missionaries. You know that this is a powerful military cult, and confronting them could blow shit up... but not confronting them allows them to spite the will of the goddess. <br/><br/>It's all about gender and politics and religion -- would you shut down and withdraw, or could it be fun for you?                        </div>

<blockquote>When is the fact that she's a woman important? When is it not? How do make my portrayals realistic without being patronizing or stereotyped?</blockquote>
I run an online role-playing game (a MUSH) with a history, but not a policy, of prohibiting the playing of a character of a different sex (when we even know). With players we know and trust, it's not much of an issue. The thing is, we can often tell when someone is cross-playing. They do a crappy job of portraying their character's sex: the character becomes a parody. Often the player doesn't even intend this. Sometimes they do, though, or don't care.<br/><br/>When someone cross-plays badly, it can be offensive. The typical thing we'll see is a male player fetishizing the body of his female character. He'll focus his role-play way too much on describing her breasts or legs or lips. Women don't role-play female characters this way. (I've never seen the opposite: a woman fetishizing male genitals in role-play, hence we are way more comfortable with women playing male characters on our game.)<br/><br/>I think offensive cross-playing is more than a problem of sex and gender.  It would be just as offensive for a white player to play a black character and emphasize all the wrong things as a parody. <br/><br/>I doubt this kind of behavior is as much of a problem around the table tops of homes of adults. I suspect it's mostly a problem online (where social barriers fall down in the face of apparent anonymity) and in adolescent games (where "Heh heh I have boobies" is still amusing).                        </div>

                            Adam, <br/><br/>I've known men who pass as women, and women who pass as men online fairly often. I've also known women who do fetishize their characters bodies (though there is often a difference in the -way- they fetishize it) for various reasons. I also think your comments about age and socalization are pretty much spot on. Which leads me to a question -- if you were playing with a female character you thought was female for some period of time, and then found out the player was male would you be upset? Because they had lied to you? For any other reason? <br/><br/>Paul, <br/><br/>Very good points! To be honest, except when I'm playing games specifically themed towards "what is a man" or "what makes masculenity" I don't pay attention to what is and is not male in my characters either. I just assume, because I am male. That's some good insightful shit right there, my friend. <br/><br/>So, if you were playing with a group of women, and they told you they wanted you to play a woman in the group, how comfortable would you be? If they did so because they told you they thought you would do a good job (and they meant it)? <br/><br/>Shreyas, <br/><br/>Oh, I see now. We just aren't speaking the same language. In a world where exclusion, boys clubs, job discrimination and issues of having children vs. chosing to "work like a man" are all things that many women face on a daily basis, things that inform the very nature of who they are and how they interact with reality, I don't see a woman playing with those issues in another setting to be like a potatoe at all. <br/><br/>Of course, minus that I'm not entirely sure what you think gender issues in play are. Could you give me some specific examples? Things that have happened in game that made you diconnect?                        </div>

I had an important realization just after I posted the last thing that think applies. The games I've been playing recently have had very strong social frameworks, and characters tend to be products of their environments. What I realized is that this makes the issue of gender roles important to fully realized characters, because characters of different genders have necessarily different backgrounds. For example, in my fifth-century Britain game, gender roles are strongly segregated. Because of this, female NPCs have a very different experiences than male NPCs. Once I can figure out what those experiences are like intellectually, I can construct a concept of identity that I can use to realize the character. It becomes less of an issue of "she's going to react this way because she's a woman" and more of a matter of "she's going to react this way because she's had these experiences because she's a woman." Does that make sense?<br/>

<blockquote>Which leads me to a question -- if you were playing with a female character you thought was female for some period of time, and then found out the player was male would you be upset? Because they had lied to you? For any other reason? </blockquote>
I would not be upset to find someone I'd played with a while wasn't the same sex as the character he or she played. If they're a sufficient role-player to play the character convincingly, it's all good. It's just a character.<br/><br/>However: My relationships with players online tends to transcend character stuff. I get to know the players in OOC discussion,  If they'd lied to me about their RL gender in conversations in which it was relevant, I'd be upset because they lied. It wouldn't necessarily be friendship-breaking though. I'd want to understand the reason for the deception. In fact, I'm pretty sure one of my online friends (whom I have never met in person) is lying about their sex, even after many years. It's become one of those "whatever" things to me and people who suspect.<br/><br/>But this RL stuff has nothing to do with cross-playing, in my opinion. Just RL trust. Cross-playing doesn't breach trust, though it may require a certain amount of trust for it to feel safe for its participants.                        </div>

                            I think I probably could, now that I think about it. Of course, it's easier for me to do in historical settings, since all we have there a vague rules about what gender roles were like anyway. In the modern world, it's much harder to get a handle on.<br/>
<br/>
Now this is taking me back to where we started. Why does the fact that I'm a man make it harder for other players to believe I'm playing a woman more than the the fact that I'm a short white guy makes it hard to believe I'm playing a tall dark elf? I'm pretty convinced that more people I've played with could see me as an elf than as a woman.<br/>

                            I think the greatest value of cross-playing is not exploration but critique. A female player might play a <i>machista</i> character to make a statement about sexism. A male player might play a lesbian to make a statement about sexual preference. <br/><br/>The other players at the table might be offended by those statements. That's the risk we take when we role-play.                        </div>

                            Adam,<br/><br/>"Cross-playing doesn't breach trust, though it may require a certain amount of trust for it to feel safe for its participants."<br/><br/>Yes. Well said.<br/><br/>As for critique rather than exploration... I think it can do both. I think critique is where it would probably start out. However, with a good GM and a good group, especially a group made up of the members of the gender/sex you're trying to explore, I think it could be done. Not easily, mind you, but with some trust and guidance and a painful lot of honesty from all. <br/><br/>Make any sense? <br/><br/>Paul, <br/><br/>Fucked if I know. My guess would be that it has to do with the "real women are real, elves aren't" issue and the flagging of physicality in gender identity. We all have these flags that we aren't even aware of, and they do a hell of a lot to tell people what gender (or at least what sex) we are. <br/><br/>Some of us (yes me) have had that horrible experience at one point in our lives where someone has mistaken us for a member of the opposite sex. For me it was in middle school, before I'd hit full puberty and had a chubby face. I had several people ask me, point blank, if I was a boy or a girl. It was pretty uncomfortable for me then (now days I'd probably have less of a problem with it), but the thing that I found out later is that it was equally discomforting for them. Mistaking someone's sex is a sign that you don't know the rules, and causes many people vast unease. As years went on I got my masculine traits and learned to "walk like a man" and the mistakes stopped. <br/><br/>Now days I'm pretty hard to confuse with a girl, due to physicality. However, you'd be amazed how little it takes for men and women with a moderately androgynous body type to pass. Without the obvious external physical characteristics, once they learn the rules they can just slide in like a member of the opposite sex and most people will never even look twice. The thing is that not all of us can learn those rules, even when they're explained to us, because gender and sexual identity have been so deeply wired into us. Its part of who we are, and something that we very much have been trained to project in order to avoid that whole uncomfortable middle-school moment. <br/><br/>So I'd guess that for a lot of us, trying to overcome the sex-gap only makes us subconsciously more flaggy. Something in us screams, "Sure I'm talking like a girl, but I'm a man! A man! A man!" And something in those looking at us starts going, "Mustache, deep voice, adam's apple... he's a man! A man! A man!" <br/><br/>To get past that, I think you have to have some acting ability yourself Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but more than that you have to have some suspension of disbelief ability among the others in your group. I think you could get that a lot of ways Ã¢â‚¬â€œ playing with people who are already gender fuckers, playing pawn stance, playing by description rather than acting, and so on. <br/><br/>So, umÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ questions. Is any of this making sense? Fit strongly with anyone else's experiences? Go strongly against anyone else's experiences?                        </div>

Baby I'm always nasty. And yes, I think masculinity in the real world has ground to a halt, while femininity has left it in the dust.

                            Larps don't generally do cross-gender casting. Usually. Except when they do.<br/>
I loved playing the guy dressing as a woman because a) this was a broad, scenery chewing round-the-bend character, which was what I had asked for and b) I got to reveal my true identity! Josh, playing my son, had a great line:<br/>
<br/>
Josh: No, Dad, you're a great dad. Really. I just have one request. When we're in public, and I'm giving a press conference -- lose the dress?<br/>
<br/>
We did some cross casting for Roman Baths. As I recall, we had a woman or two who specifically asked to be cross cast, and I think our questionnaire asked how the players felt about that.<br/>
<br/>
Josh once told me about a larp where every character had gender neutral names, and no one had wives or husbands. They had Life Partners. (This made sense in context.) So, for Jamais Vue, our amnesia larp, I did likewise. It's easy coming up with 20 gender neutral names. It's hard writing detailed character sheets (to be handed back in sadistically portioned chunks) without using the third person singular.<br/>
<br/>
Todd Furler uses Faces to create pictures of characters for the badges. He said that this had two interesting effects in larps where he cast guys as women.<br/>
<br/>
1. The guys had a picture of their PC, so they did not try to talk in a silly falsetto that just drew attention to how not a woman they were.<br/>
<br/>
2. The picture went into a badge holder that fell to chest hight. This meant that someone talking to a guy who was playing a woman, and looking at the badge to "see" who he was interacting with wound up staring at the person's chest, an oddly realistic touch, I am told.<br/>
<br/>
Hm. The Angel game he ran at GenCon had pictures of the PCs in plastic stands, so cross gender play didn't cause confusion. Of course, the only one playing cross gender was me. (I chose last, as I was the one genericking my way in, and I had a choice of Connor or Lorne. Both cool, both male.) And, the fact that it was Angel, where we all knew the characters, would have helped even if we'd never role played before.<br/>
<br/>
For Dark of the Moon, the larp we've been working on for over a decade, we want badges not just for gender stuff. If you're a 40-something playing an 8 year old, or a 20-something playing a 70 year old, it's nice to know. Plus, we've got a lot of animal roles. It's really helpful if I know I'm looking at a bat or a leopard.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, Josh's comment about the D&amp;D group just not tracking who's playing cross-gender is apt. I'm not sure how many are aware that I'm, as usual, playing a guy. Maybe now that we've sent out a list of who's who, they've figured it out. But there, the dynamic is skewed by the fact that it's a huge group, and we focus on tactics, so gender's not hugely important. Race? Sure! That determines what you've got pluses in and what language you speak and stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
The running joke is that Josh plays the woman and I play the man. It's not universally true, but it happens a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Josh and I are domestic partners, and we've been living together for over 7 years. When we do in-game romance, our default is NOT to do it with each other. That's what we do when we're not gaming, and we want to come as we aren't when we're gaming. It's not a hard rule, especially if one of us is gming. Odds favor PC-NPC romance over PC-PC, I think.<br/>
<br/>
The thing about most larps is that the players don't generally get to make up their PCs. They're usually cast in advance by the gms, although "in advance" may mean "Is everyone here? Okay, I'll hand out roles at random." For table top, players create their own PCs most of the time. Except at conventions, most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Some convention runs mandate playing the opposite gender. Both Kult games I played in had only male PCs. No biggie.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen a lot of points discussed here raised elsewhere. I've never been in the kind of gaming group where I felt uncomfortable because of my gender, and I never want to be.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago at Arisia, an sf convention, I went to a panel on women in gaming. One of my players, Avram, asked if that wasn't old hat already. I said that when I stopped hearing about how some idiot male gm thought it'd be a great idea to have one of his NPCs molest a female player's female PC, then, maybe, it'd be old hat. I look forward to that day.<br/>

                            I've played maybe half women PCs. The reason I did this is because it's a really easy way to make really punchy characters. See, roleplaying games really thrive on cliche. I will wave at the usual roleplaying-as-jazz analogy that's been floating around since at least the early nineties, and note that it's a really good thing to have a common basis to improvise off of. You bring a hard-boiled, hard-drinking PI to the table, and the GM knows that he has to add a dangerously seductive femme fatale, and you know that your PI has to take stupid risks on her behalf, and so on and so on -- the game just plain flows when you do that.<br/>
<br/>
However, what flows out of this process is very often derivative mush. You've got a narrative that knows the notes but not the tune, because it's not it's own thing -- everybody is just supplying the moves that are embedded into our cultural consciousness. Plot points happen because they're the plot points that are supposed to happen, and not because they are the authentic responses of those particular characters.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is that if you take these archetypal (stereotypical!) roles, you can often get a whole new character just by flipping the gender or sexual roles. Take that PI, and make him a her. Now, she's still hard-boiled and hard-drinking and world-weary, but she's a woman. When the moderator brings in the femme fatale, odds are it's NOT just going to be a replay of the last five thousand noir flicks we've all memorized. We still have the common base to riff off of -- but we don't know exactly what's going to happen anymore.<br/>
<br/>
I'm overselling just a bit, of course. Some gender-flipped stereotypes have been done often enough to turn into their own cliches. For example, you can't make a generic action hero interesting by turning him into a generic action heroine anymore (cf., Catwoman, Elektra, Underworld, Aeon Flux). <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, you can also get the same effect by switching sexuality.                        </div>

<br/>
Another late reply. I wrote this before going to bed, but when I tried to post it the forum went down.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Excellent information, thanks! It sounds like your group, after an initial weirdness, was pretty happy with TSOY for letting you tackle romance and sexual themes without actually having to have sex onscreen or having romance dominate the game. Is that a fair assessment?</i><br/>
<br/>
Excellent thread. Glad I could contribute.<br/>
<br/>
That would be a fair assessment, yes. I asked both players this question too, and they agree.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Also, as you're sounding very interesting Mr Gone and Back Again, how does the "switch" in your gaming before and after your long break feel to you?</i><br/>
<br/>
Actually, my gaming the last couple of months has so little in common with the way I gamed when I was younger that I consider them almost completely seperable.<br/>
<br/>
If it weren't for the baggage I brought with me when I started again about a year and a half ago, I wouldn't connect the two at all.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Are you happier with the romance and (veiled, off-screen) sex in the game?</i><br/>
<br/>
In the games it has come up, yeah. I like it. I'd like to explore it some more.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Does it give you anything in game you didn't have before?</i><br/>
<br/>
A sense of purpose as well as something that speaks to me as the person I am today.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Is there anything with gender relations in game you've wanted to do, but haven't been able to yet?</i><br/>
<br/>
I know I'd like something that says something about what it means (for me) to be a man.<br/>
<br/>
I am a father. I'm on my second year (14 months) of parental leave. I think it would be cool to explore the thing about being a parent without having the need to be either mother or father, woman or man. And how it would affect the children to grow up in such an environment.<br/>
<br/>
Shock: migth be the game for that. I'm looking forward to that one a lot.                        </div>

                            I'm very new here, so I'm a little hesitant to jump in at this point in the discussion, but this is something I feel pretty strongly about.<br>
<br>
Like peaseblossom, I do not play male characters as PCs, except in the rare case when the players and characters are both more than 50% female.  I want to have women represented in the game, but equally important, I want to make interesting stories for my girls.  I want to show the other players that you can be an authentic woman and an authentic role-player at the same time, and give women really interesting stories.<br>
<br>
As a GM, things are interestingly different.  I play plenty of male NPCs, but I always try to make sure that there's a 50-50 gender split among the NPCs I create.  It's easy to relegate Random Anonymous NPC to always being male, or to introduce female characters only as love interests or badass villainesses.  <br>
<br>
I also don't think I've ever run a game without gender-bending players.  I have never explicitly asked them to do it, but my players know that I feel strongly about feminist issues in gaming, and I think it makes them more open to experimentation.<br>
<br>
I'm also a straight GM running 1. a gay romance for gay characters and straight players, 2. a gay romance for gay characters and gay players, and 3. a het romance for straight characters and straight players.  We also have a het romance involving a gay player, but his girlfriend is incorporeal so I'm not sure it counts.  (Long story.)<br>
<br>
I admit that I'm known as the romance GM of my group, in that I always make sure that players do not neglect the sexual and emotional sides of their characters, so long as it is in-genre and appropriate.  However, I'm also known as the Evil Bitch Hardcore GM Who Will Give You Lots Of Problems, so I think it balances out.  :)  (Both other GMs in my group are known to be big softies!  Me, I like tragedy, conflict and drama.  They taste like chicken, chocolate and asparagus, respectively.)<br>
<br>
I'm definitely exploring gender issues of my own in my games, though.  One major issue I've got has to do with children (I'm very hesitant about having them), and I've found that children/being a father/being a mother has turned into a major theme of the game I'm running now.<br>
<br>
Dealing with the heavy religious themes of my Roman-period game (such as the rise of Christianity) has been much harder for our group, though, than the gender issues.  We range from a guy who's in theological seminary to a committed atheist, so those scenes are often . . . interesting.  Perhaps it's because my group has a couple of women and lots of people with alternate sexual lifestyles (gay, bi, poly) and one really strong feminist (me) that the gender thing has worked pretty smoothly.<br>
<br>
Often it's simply a matter of calling players on their assumptions, or running exercises like having players create a character first, then flip a coin for gender.  For whatever reason, though, my experiences have been so far, so good.                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<p>Fascinating thread!</p>
<p>I haven't played a female character as a primary character for a long time (basically, after I grew out of playing out my adolescent sexual fantasies in RPGs.)  But, as a GM, I've of course played a lot of female characters, and I some of my most compelling, recurring NPCs have been female.</p>
<p>In pursuit of acting, I've actually spent a long time studying womens' body-language, and I bring this in whenever I play, either in terms of acting or description.  (For reference, I'm very male looking -- I have broad shoulders, a beard, and lots of body hair.)  At this point, the only part that I'm totally comfortable with is hand gestures (which are almost entirely from an ex-girlfriend), but man... it makes a huge difference to role-playing.  People have no trouble knowing when I'm playing a female character or not as soon as I bring in some of those cues.</p>
<p>So body-language might be a good tool to try in terms of getting people to remember what gender you're playing.  Not in terms of "I look / act like a man/woman" but just as a way of giving a cue "I am playing a female character now / I am playing a male character now."</p>
<p>I have no trouble <em>writing</em> female characters.  Now I'm feeling like I want to start playing some again.</p>
<p>yrs--<br>
--Ben</br></p>
<p>P.S.  Now that I think of it, there was one female PC, which was Princess Flora in Blue Line City this GenCon.  Who was a fascinating character, but definitely me choosing to play a woman so I could explore one, gender-related, issue -- in this case the whole Madonna/Whore complex.  (Flora did both, well, and was very miserable for it.)</p>

<p>Okay, Brand, here's that thing.</p>
<p>I don't feel like gender issues deserve a <em>more</em> special place than, say, race, culture, or religion issues. I see these issues of job discrimination in my own life, and have to grapple with other things too, like the convenience-store/medical-professional stereotype, and the odd looks I get from some people when I eat beef, because of the color of my skin and the customs of a country I am not a part of.</p>
<p>So there's an issue I have there of balanced screentime between issues.</p>
<p>And that's where I disengage - as in a Polaris game in the recent past where I was trying to have some dialogue about loyalty and friendship with Etzlitotec, when she suddenly bursts out bawling about childbirth and male oppression. Wtf?, I say? By the time I have collected my faculties (I was too baffled by the left-field nature of this to react with conflict statements at the time), the scene is pretty much over and we are back to my Mistaken's Knight, who happens to be a midwife and having a personal conflict with some old politician about whether the Knights should continue to permit female membership, based on some nebulous argument that never did get aired in play.</p>
<p>So it's like there's this issue here, and as that character's Mistaken I am already invested in it and doing my best to make it satisfying for the other player, and then it crawls over and <em>invades</em> the space where I'm telling another story. But it's not a big enough issue to me for that to be okay.</p>

                            Add one more late reply here:<br><br><code>So, a question: if we can play psionic elves made of energy from the 31st and 1/2 century without a blink, why does playing a member of the opposite sex cause us such trauma? And I don't even mean in terms of the difficulty of portayal -- Josh and Nancy already did an admirable job dealing with that. I mean why does it lead us to questions like this? Why the tension? Why the concern?</code><br><br>You know, this is a question that has come up for me before.  For the -longest- time I was the only gamer in my group that was a female.  I got asked on many occasions "How do I play a girl?"<br><br>I can tell you, I still don't know the answer to that and I've been a girl all my life.<br><br>See, I think so many people are stuck on 'playing it right'.  Or 'playing it correctly'.  Does that make sense?<br><br/>As for the tension... I'm not sure.  Maybe becasue for some, it is a challenge.  In my experiience, I've found that challenges cause stress and tension for some people.  Maybe it's the 'something so different' feeling...  So many people put such a stress on the fact that men and women are different.  Men and women are different.  Etc, etc.  So if you have that pounded into your head long enough, you begin to believe it and then you begin to live it. <br/><br/>I myself play primarily female roles when I play.  But that doesn't mean I can't and haven't played male characters before.  I just happen to like playing female characters.  If anything, the hard thing for me to play is a passive character be they male or female.  See, now that's a challenge!<br/><br/>Lisa P                        </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></div>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Matt</span>, <br/><br/>Your comments make me want to say all sorts of things that aren't really germane to this thread. Perhaps I will start a new thread. Perhaps not. Even on this lovely forum I don't know how it'd go over. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lisa</span>, <br/><br/>That is some fascinating stuff! I don't have a lot of experience of LARP (I've done it may 3 times), and you're totally opening my eyes to things I hadn't thought about. <br/><br/>As for the playing romance not with each other, that's an interesting point. Mo and I usually do play romance together Ã¢â‚¬â€œ but I'm usually the GM so that's skewed. A lot of our friends do it the way you do, and I hadn't even really consciously recognized it. Many couples that RP in our group (and we do sex and romance like crazy) don't hook up with each other IC Ã¢â‚¬â€œ unless (big unless) they've switched sexes/genders for their characters. Then they often do hook up IC. <br/><br/>Must think on that. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Neelk</span>, <br/><br/>Interesting observation. I have to admit I never would have read the Kate Martinelli novels if it wasn't for the fact that it was "hard boiled lesbian detective" fiction Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as the whole hardboiled genre from modern writers isn't something I'm often interested in. <br/><br/>My question for you is how do you avoid superficiality? I mean, the Kate Martinelli novels are interesting because they are written targeting lesbians as an audience rather than boys with lesbian fantasies, but when you're a guy playing a girl in a guy's role (or girl playing a guy in a girl's role Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which, interestingly, we see much less often!) how do you keep her from just being a boy with breasts (or a girl with a schlong)? Or is that the point? <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Anders</span>, <br/><br/>Damn that's good stuff! <br/><br/>And yea, Shock looks like it might work for that. Hell, it'd be a game of Shock I'd very much like to play with you. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jessica</span>, <br/><br/>Welcome! Don't hesitate to jump in, I'm nice and don't bite. Much.<br/><br/>I'd just like to say about this bit:<code>admit that I'm known as the romance GM of my group, in that I always make sure that players do not neglect the sexual and emotional sides of their characters, so long as it is in-genre and appropriate. However, I'm also known as the Evil Bitch Hardcore GM Who Will Give You Lots Of Problems, so I think it balances out. </code>That is my experience of such GMs (I'm much like the boy version of you, from the sounds of it) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and girl GMs even more. Romance and sex in games, IME ONLY, make them tougher and more emotional rather than the reverse. But as we've seen many others on this thread would probably disagree. <br/><br/>Now, for questions: How do you go about addressing the whole child-bearing thing in game as a theme? I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts on this matter as I've already revealed in this thread that its something I'm stupid about.<br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ben</span>, <br/><br/>Good stuff. Now if only we could SEE you so that we could be instructed in these cues of yours. <br/><br/>How'd the whole Madonna/whore thing go? That's a particularly tricksome issue to tackle, and I'd love more details. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Fred</span>, <br/><br/>Is Thomas around on this board? I'd love to hear from him about that. <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Lisa P</span>, <br/><br/>I think that whole 'pounded into your head' is, indeed, a big part of it. <br/><br/>And, because I was already talking about it Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if you were to make and play a passive male character, how would you approach it? <br/><br/><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Shreyas</span>,<br/><br/>Ah, okay. See to me that sounds less like it's about gender issues in play, and more about gender issues being used as a trump to hog/control the game at a social level. I'd probably have a problem with that too. (Though, I can't say for sure without talking to the player on the other side of the story.) Honestly, I hate it when anyone uses "my issue trumps your issue" at any time Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and gender issues in game are no exception to that. <br/><br/>As for the whole "race/religion/other issues also being important" I hear you. Did I ever tell you about the time that someone asked me to play in a Deadlands game in Salt Lake, and when I sat down the first thing they told me is that I couldn't be a Mormon faithful because in the game Mormon's weren't a real religion and Brigham Young wasn't a prophet? <br/><br/>That was some fun.                        </div>

I'm not really sure of how I would do that actually.  The few times that I did try something close, I either ended up playing the PC like a sniveling fool, or it ended up that the other players drove play toward my PC giving up being passive.  Not their fault or anything like that.  It's just how the story ended up going.  <br/><br/>I think I have the issue of being passive as one to truly grasp.  It's more foreign to me than playing a male, an older person, a cripple, a psycho, etc, etc.  Playing someone that won't speak up, won't fight for what they believe, won't make a move... very hard for me.  Maybe it's because I am so proactive sometimes.  (To a fault at times...)<br/><br/>Just the last few times I've played, I have not had the opportunity to really try it again.  Maybe that's what I do next.  Maybe next time I play DiTV or The Roach.  *ponders*  Hell, I think I may have just had a PC spring into my head.  <br/><br/>Lisa P                        </div>

                            I'll note the amusement of having a "Lisa P." (urbanpagan) and "Lisa" (ie, Lisa Padol).  Might want to use different nicknames.<br/>
<br/>
Re relationship stuff: I think part of the reason we don't tend to do romance with one another (as PCs) is because it doesn't seem fair.  If a pair -do- do romance with one another, it opens up the "they're in an IC romance because they're in an OC romance" can of worms, and tends to close off other IC romances.  Kinda like how you don't want to dance too often with your partner if you want to have a hope of dancing with other people (and in ages past, it was just rude, rude, rude).<br/>
<br/>
We don't usually even hook up when gender switched (which is, of course, a natural followup to "we usually play gender-switched" and "we don't usually hook up", but I figured I might as well say it out loud), though I'd like to be cast in a romantic relationship with Lisa in a LARP, just as an interesting twist (we do sometimes ask to be cast together, but to my memory have never had that answered romantically -- I've been her father, she's been my father, and there are probably other casts we've had that I don't remember...but not that one).                        </div>

                            Oh, one exception -- in Mistatonic University+20  we were husband and wife.  But I don't think we even asked to be cast together then (OTOH, Mike Young, who ran/write the game, knew we were involved).  In Mike's Circus LARP, Colonel T. Rawhide's Circus of the Spectacular, Lisa was secretly the princess I needed to kidnap/protect, whereas Beth (a friend, and also a player in our Sorceror game and Cthulhupunk+20) played the character I had a romantic involvement with.                        </div>

                            Oh -- a question: how does people's discomfort or comfort with gender switching relate, or not, to playing children or childlike characters?  I know there are groups that have real problems with people who play children, or even characters that more or less act like children (kender, malkavians, pookah).<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, how does this relate to playing gender-switched children?  Is it different for a guy to play a little girl (or a woman to play a boy) than a woman?<br/>
<br/>
And, for that matter, how does this relate to going the other question -- playing characters much older than the players?  Isn't this even less believable (except when done very well) than gender play?                        </div>

                            I don't have problems with those who play children, so long as they do it with some kind of positive agenda or thought. I'm an elementary school teacher though, so those who just "act childish" without a plan often end up irking me. Not reaonsable, I know, but it happens anyway. <br/><br/>Childlike adults and "magical retards" really, really, really, really piss me off. I've worked with special needs children and adults on and off for years, and the ways that other supposedly mature human beings portray them -- even when they think they are being positive and uplifting -- drives me towards rage faster than someone using the word "literally" wrong. <br/><br/>I think its worth noting that both of those are due to specific things I've done/political issues that I've dealt with IRL. Back before I taught I used to play in groups with childlike PCs all the time, and the only time it annoyed me was when it was used as an excuse to Prima Donna, Mary Sue, and otherwise steal spotlight time. That was always irksome, but is (I think) something people do with it rather than something inherent to the form. <br/><br/>Oh, and when people play kids I probably pay less attention to gender than with adults. Though I suppose it depends on the specific age of the kid. Those under 8-9 and those 10 to teen have different psychologies, and teens are their own whole thing....                        </div>

                            Hi Brand, the board just ate a long response, so here's a short one.<br/>
<br/>
All the story cliches of genre fiction have intrinsic sexual dynamics to them. It's blatantly obvious in the case of the detective and the _femme fatale_, but even kill-the-dragon-save-the-princess has them. When you flip the sex of a character, those standardized dynamics don't necessarily apply anymore. If my hard-boiled PC is a straight woman, then when the FF vamps it up my PC just isn't going to react the same way as a straight man would. <br/>
<br/>
Odds are, how she SHOULD react isn't going to be part of the standard genre code, either. This means that I need to come up with her response on my own, and I'm probably going to draw on who this particular detective is, and on her particular circumstances. A response like that is going to be one that's authentic to the character, and that's how I can avoid superficiality. As an incidental side-benefit, I'm not playing the character as a guy with breasts, but that's a consequence of being true to the character and not a direct goal.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you can do the same thing by putting a man into a standard role usually filled by women characters. This is less common simply because genre fiction is overweighted towards significant male roles, but it works just as well when it applies.                        </div>

<b>Brand:</b><br/><br/><code>Though at this point I'm thinking I spot potential for a spin off about playing across age lines -- in addition to playing kids, how many of us regularly play senior citizens or even just folks a full generation older than us?</code><br/><br/>This is another discussion that I think is fascinating. Aside from all of the immortal or extended life kinds of folks (immortals, vampires, altered humans) who most often even to *appear* young, the vast majority of PC's I've ever (been or) interacted with were teens or twenty-somethings. I've often wondered if it has to do with self projection, wish fulfillment, concepts of virility or capability or beauty or all of the above. <br/><br/>I played an elderly man who was a grump Nocker in a Changeling LARP who was intentionally as old as he was because he was created for me to explore a "Rage! Rage! Against the dying of the light!" theme. I've played very few of these kinds of characters, and never, I think, have I chosen one just incidentally. Nor have I chosen to play someone middle aged. Funny that.<br/><br/>By default, most of my characters end up in their middle 20's. When I was in my middle 20's, I thought that's just cause I was defaulting to my own status quo - the age didn't matter so it might as well be my own age. Now that I'm in my middle 30's, while a number of my characters are middle 30's, the majority still turn out to be in their middle 20's. <br/><br/>Why? Maybe because I had my most vibrant energy at that age and my characters often have a kind of vibrant energy. Maybe because standards of beauty trend that way and many of my characters play with concepts of beauty. Maybe it's because I underwent some of my greatest emotional evolution in my middle 20's and emotional evolution of character is fascinating and "F" fulfilling to me. Maybe I'm just copping out.<br/><br/>Yet, I find it funny that in <i>1000 Stories</i> when we started playtesting chargen almost all of the test characters that I created were elegiac 30, 40 and 50 year olds. So maybe it's not entirely the players, maybe it's the games. How many of them encourage us to move beyond the decade of our adult youth? How many reward or encourage not being strong, or fast or traditionally lovely? How many reward caution and wisdom over courage and impulsiveness? How much do we tell ourselves that our best, most epic, most worth-telling stories are the stories of our youth?<br/><br/>God, I sound old don't I... and is that a bad thing?<br/><br/><br/>(edited for typos)                        </div>

                            Brand -- about Flora.  Flora was interesting, because she wasn't really a woman.  She was a cartoon, drawn by a man, at some level to be his sexual fantasy (indeed, her edge was "paternalistic sexual fantasy").  The game was about "cartoons off work."  Flora was an angry, violent, vicious alchoholic.  Presumably, on camera, she was a sweet, spunky Disney-esque princess, although we never really got to see her on camera, only complain about her parts.<br/>
<br/>
I can really only begin to touch on the depths of stuff going on in that game, though.  Suffice it to say that she worked out great, for me, and I would jump at the chance to play her again.  If any of other participants in that game (Emily, Joshua, Alan, Eric, and also Star and Meg sorta) want to talk about it, that would be cool.<br/>
<br/>
As for the hand gestures, it's actually three very simple things.<br/>
<br/>
1) Women tend to gesture with the wrists bent outward, men tend to gesture with the wrists bent inward.  (Notably, religious men gesture with wrists bent outward.)<br/>
<br/>
2) Women tend to reach out, and pull towards them.  Men tend to move from their bodies outward.<br/>
<br/>
3) Women are much more comfortable moving their hands into other people's personal space.  Men, when they want something, tend to move their whole bodies forward a little bit.  Women often reach toward and lightly touch other people.<br/>
<br/>
When I play women I try to consciously not gesture with my whole body, but more with my hands, turn my wrists out, and touch people more.  I also pitch my voice soft (not high, soft.)  This tends to work out pretty well.<br/>

                            Ben, <br/><br/>God I am so jealous about not being in that game. Sounds kick ass. <br/><br/>Your rules are also awesome. Another one that I use is the position of the legs realtive to the body when sitting. Men will more often sprawl and leave their legs open, especially when displaying confidence, where women tend to keep their legs closer together and more under the body. <br/><br/>And I gesture with my wrists bent outward, which must mean I'm either a woman or religious. Maybe both. <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/> </div>

                            Well, Brand, aren't mormons all priests, anyway?  :-)  By "religious," I mean "the standard set of blessing gestures that priests tend to use."<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure about the wrist thing.  Like I said, my patterning is based on a specific ex-girlfriend, and so when I say "men" I actually mean "me" and when I say "women" I actually mean "Sheryl."<br/>

Yes, I found that very interesting (By "interesting" we mean "sex" right?) as I was typing it.  I've never consciously thought about these things before, at least, not in this way (my thoughts were "what would Sheryl do?" not "what am I doing?" if that makes any sense.)<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I couldn't think of anything useful to say about it.  One for the "huh" file.<br/>

I was underscoring the connections between socialization of men and women and the Push/Pull dynamic ( I have a post up on my blog about it). Not as proof, but as an interesting associative observation.                        </div>

(I mean, obviously I know why....)

                            When I'm playing a man, I square my shoulders as opposed to leaving them fluid and relaxed.  That's my <a href="/forums/search?Search=%231&amp;Mode=like">#1</a>, unbeatable, the-players-can-always-tell cue that I'm playing a guy.  Admittedly, it doesn't work so well for certain personality types of men, but even then, squaring my shoulders briefly before adopting the character's posture seems to help a lot.<br/><br/>And, hi Brand.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><i>That is my experience of such GMs (I'm much like the boy version of you, from the sounds of it) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and girl GMs even more. Romance and sex in games, IME ONLY, make them tougher and more emotional rather than the reverse. But as we've seen many others on this thread would probably disagree.</i><br/><br/>Well, it's not just sex and romance - it's all kinds of interpersonal ties.  And I'm pretty excited to be the girl version of you, as you seem very cool.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><i>Now, for questions: How do you go about addressing the whole child-bearing thing in game as a theme? I'd be very interested to hear your thoughts on this matter as I've already revealed in this thread that its something I'm stupid about.</i><br/><br/>Well, honestly, I'm mostly giving the players opportunities to address it, so I'm not sure I can tell you how it's going to work out.  In practice, this meant taking each of the four characters and giving them a relationship with having/keeping/caring for children that is different from the others, but in some way presents a personal challenge or conflict.  One character was married many years ago, but his wife left him while pregnant with his child, and he has just rediscovered his son after many years, forcing him to figure out what it means to him to be a father.  (His son is also one of the major antagonists, so he doesn't really have a choice about dealing with him one way or the other!)  Another character is a warrior woman, very proud of her valor, who made the mistake of sleeping with a fertility god.  Now she's trying to cope with the changes in her body, and what it's going to mean for her to try to raise a child, and whether she wants her child to follow in her violent footsteps.  A third character was just involved in an arranged marriage, and his new wife is about to have a baby - she's thrilled, he's not.  And finally, the fourth character has always wanted the perfect child, but is infertile, and is now trying to deal with the fact that her lover is going to have a baby while she can never bear a child.<br/><br/>I didn't entirely plan it, but once character <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> got his wife pregnant, everyone wanted to get on the bandwagon.  I'm trying to set up a variety of situations where the emotional context of parenthood strains against the rest of the game world in interesting ways, to force the players and the characters to think through how they really feel about these issues.<br/><br/>This week, for example, character <a href="/forums/search?Search=%233&amp;Mode=like">#3</a> had to save his newly-pregnant wife from plummeting off a building - something that wouldn't have hurt her, but probably would have lost her the child that he's not sure he wants anyways.  It created a lot of emotional conflict and ambiguity for him, and now that he's saved her he's feeling guilty for even having considered letting her fall.  It's great stuff.<br/><br/>For me, the key has been avoiding the "OMG PARENTING IS SO WONDERFUL AND NATURAL" cliches and trying to emphasize conflict, difficulty and turmoil.  So far, it's worked pretty well - though I have to thank some wonderful players for that more than anything else.  I don't want to preach about what it means to be a parent, a caregiver or a child, and they're providing all the richness of response to the situations I set up for them.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

<p>So, tell me, is there any situation in which you can see yourself being safe and comfortable enough with the person/people you're playing with to actually use sex and gender in an erotic way? Or is that just right out?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>My gut response was "right out".</p>
<p>But then, damn you, I started imagining myself in such a situation, with some people I know. And I think it can be done. I am not sure I will do it well, I am not sure <em>they</em> will. By "well" I mean not chickening out or over-acting to the point of ridicule (which creates distance and by this, safety). I am not sure they will feel comfortable about it, even if I do. I'm not sure about lots of things here. Veils shall be drawn in any case, I guess.</p>
<p>I think I did something like this with the latent-bisexual witch I was playing. I wanted to experiment there, to explore. To create a story of power-in-purity (she was a virgin) vs power-in-creation (her sister giving birth), love and trust vs simply lust, rebellion and cold detachment from worldly affairs vs commiting herself to her fellow (wo)men, and all these of course tied to blood and sacrifice (in the Verbana Mage tradition). Sex and gender were not as much issues in themselves as ways to express certain types of confilct.</p>
<p>But I was kindof passive in that game, for lots of reasons. By the time I tried to push towards some sort of friendly relationship with a female NPC (who was VERY bitchy and sexually manipulative - I remember people cracking jokes about the two of us doing the naughty bit), the group stopped gaming together.</p>
<p>A late thought about the question I was answering above: I think that what I need is distance from RL. My greatest problem might be that people will misconstrue the PC action with a player's (mine) hidden desires or somesuch. I think that that distance may best be achieved for me if I play a female PC whose romantic interest is a male PC played by a female player. It seems to me that the other 7 combinations can be more easily projected on some hidden RL desire, in an essentially sexually-insecure and stereotypic way. I leave those as an excercise to the reader :-)</p>

                            MarK, <br/><br/>Damn fine stuff to chew on there. For the record, I can appreciate your situations quite a lot. <br/><br/>Warning, some nasty language is a coming up...<br/><br/>I have a group that I've been playing with for like 4 or 5 years now, on and off (I used to play with them when I was in Toronto on vacation, and then not see them for 6 months, so the time lapse is a little odd) whom I trust very much. One of them is my wife. Another was the best man at my wedding, and I the best man at his. The final is his wife, who was my wife's maid of honor at our wedding, and my wife hers. So you can see about how tightly we're bound together. <br/><br/>So, about 2 and a half years ago when we start doing this namby-pamby Nar play that I'd been pushing at them we end up in an Exalted game with a lot of sexual dynamics going on. At one point the other guy was forcefully seduced (pretty much raped) by a deathknight. It was a powerful, disturbing scene -- no sex was played out, but the implied parts were bad enough. It happened very fast, and when Mo realized what was going to happen she started and said, "You're going to fuck death cunt!" She said it not as a joke, but as a spontaneous reaction to the sheer visceral impact that the action of the game had. <br/><br/>Problem was that everyone at the table had been tense, as it was both a tense scene and the first time we had deliberatly and with concious knowledge approached the subject so head on. So as soon as she says it I and the other woman laugh our asses off, because it sounded really damn funny. So my friend is sitting there with us laughing at this horrible fucking situation that he'd just started feeling proud of himself for authoring. As a result the rest of the scene went flat, and we wrapped it up faster than we should have and moved on. <br/><br/>Luckily, after game, the player brought up his reaction to us and let us know how fucked up it was. Mo clarified that she hadn't meant it mockingly, and we talked about the situation and agreed to set up some social perameters for when situations like that came up in the future. And in that game, sex issues did come up over and over again, and ironically we never had to use the new language we'd set up. It's like once we'd been through the fire and looked each other in the eye and talked about it afterwards things cleared up and we knew we could do it again. <br/><br/>So hell, I know what you feel. It isn't easy to do, and it does require a lot of trust in the group.<br/><br/>Now, as for the issue of male player playing female PC with interest in male PC played by female player -- my wife and I have actually done that once or twice. And when we didn't do it with our closest groups we got some weird looks anyway. Really, I think once you get into the waters of gender and sex in game there isn't any completly safe combination.                        </div>

                            I'm coming in well into this discussion, I know.<br/>
<br/>
When I started roleplaying, it never really occurred to me not to play cross gender.  My first character was an 800 year old man who was a devoted father.  During the set up of that game, I came across a discussion of roleplaying cross gender in which various people were saying 'oh it's an abomination' or 'I only allow it for people who I know are experienced roleplayers and can be trusted not to do it wrong'.  I was a little freaked, but went on anyway, and while there were problems with the game, I don't think any of them had anything to do with playing cross gender.<br/>
<br/>
I think visualisation is another factor involved.  I regularly play in a small group of three people.  One person is ok at visualising characters.  One is really not, and says up front that it doesn't matter how one describes a character, she's only ever going to see the person in front of her, because she just can't go from words to an image in her head.  I, on the other hand, am really good at it.  When I play table top, I have no trouble visualising the characters as looking different from the people portraying them.  To the point that sometimes I may be playing with you, and I don't see you at all.  I'm fine with playing cross gender.  The non-visualising person doesn't much like it.  And the ok visualiser is fine with people playing cross gender, but most comfortable playing his own gender.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, despite these limitations, my current game with this group is GMed by the non-visualiser-doesn't-like-cross-gender-play, and involves two young men on the cusp of adulthood, and the first half a dozen sessions involved an awful lot of teenage boy joking around, competing over chicks, and trying to shag women.  One of these young men is played by me, a woman.  And yet, nobody has had a problem, and my characterisation has been complimented.<br/>
<br/>
I think the visualisation angle ties into the different tenor that playing cross gender online can have.  Online the players physical appearance is not a constant presence, highlighting the disjunct between player and character.  When we are highly aware of that difference, we are more likely to scruitinise the portrayal of the character in light of this difference.  So we fall into the pattern of saying 'that's right' or 'that's wrong' when, if we were less aware of the difference, we'd be accepting these things without thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I guess my feeling is that I find playing across gender lines a non-issue, and I have to remind myself to be sensitive to those people for whom it is an issue.  I don't think that attitudes towards playing across gender lines is simply a matter of attitudes towards gender,  but also a function of how we imagain and how that process of imagining may differently highlight differences between reality and what is imagained.<br/>

                            Claire, <br/><br/>It's something I've often wondered about -- where the ideas come from. I started playing out of a D&amp;D box in the late 70s at the age of 5. I was a very advanced reader and precocious in all sorts of ways, and so I got my friends together and we played. Later on we had an adult, someone's uncle, run a game for us to show us how to "do it right." And all that time we were all boys and we played all boys. <br/><br/>I don't think any of us ever played a girl in any game though, not just RPGs, which shouldn't be suprising considering this was South East Texas in the late 70s/early 80s. Boys going about pretending to be girls just wasn't something that was done. <br/><br/>Then California and the 90s rolls around and I'm in groups with girls playing girls and boys playing boys, and then someone is a girl playing a boy -- and no one notices. I didn't even notice the first time, or care all that much. Until the next campaign with that group, when one of the guys wanted to play a girl and half the group told him he was fucked up. <br/><br/>Now I'm noticing something in this thread: a lot of girls here either play boys freely or deliberatly chose not to play boys because they want to play girls, while a lot of guys are uncomfortable playing girls for various reasons. <br/><br/>I look at that, and have to think back to Texas in the 70s and how boys just didn't play as girls and Cali in the 90s and how it was okay for a girl to play as a boy, but not the opposite, and wonder how much of this is enculturated. <br/><br/>What'yall think?                        </div>

                            The short answer?<br/><br/>Yes, I think it's very much enculturated, but not just in the obvious ways.<br/><br/>There's the men-have-higher-status factor, where for a man to put aside that power, even in a game, opens him to the danger of losing it.  (Microcosm?  Men's names can become women's names, but never vice versa . . . I think someone brought this up in another thread.)<br/><br/>There's the male-characters-are-the-default factor, where choosing to play a woman is an active choice, but a woman playing a man is much more normal because maleness is the assumed norm.  For anyone, particularly a man, to play a woman is a Statement where playing a man is not.<br/><br/>But there's also the fact that men may not feel comfortable saying, "I prefer to play male characters" in the way that women can say "I prefer to play female characters."  I had one player repeatedly express his discomfort with playing female characters, but when he tried it, he did a great job.  Only after some discussion did it come out that he just didn't like it, and was afraid that he'd be seen as sexist if he came out and said so.<br/><br/>And on top of that is the fact that most role-playing games reward traditionally 'masculine' activities like fighting, so to play a woman by using cultural cues of what women are and do (rather than personal experience) becomes extremely complicated, as most of them just don't fit.<br/><br/>When it comes to gender, culture screws us in <i>layers</i>, <i><b>layers</b></i> I tell you!  Oy.                        </div>

                            Um, what Jess said. I would add a watered-down observation that for a man to play a female character is emasculating (= presumably bad). But for a woman to play a male character is empowering (= presumably good). We still have a long way to go, I guess.  <br/>
<br/>
Also - I believe (although I might be wrong) many men have gamed since they were boys/teenagers. It's that stage where enculturation takes place, and it's very much ingrained. I know some for whom this goes quite deep; by that I also mean they only play xD&amp;D because all other games are not "real roleplaying", and accordingly they're very touchy about their "turf". I think that gaming for some is something which is rooted quite a lot in adolescent masculinity, with all the violence, sexual insecurity and alpha-male struggle. Its roots are there, and its fruits are there as well. As your experience shows, gaming is certainly a mirror of culture. But different games, and different people certainly can change that (like V:tM, and newer Indie games). <br/>

                            I don't know who recalls, but way back earlier in this thread Fred said:
<blockquote>I've taken a female PC in Matt's Skype Nine Worlds game...<br/>Who's the (formerly NPC) wife of another PC.<br/><br/>I think I may have freaked Thomas out a bit when I spoke ICly as this character, because he quickly broke into OOC mode (which we've been in, a lot, in this game) and dropped his character's voice.<br/><br/>It'll be interesting to see how this plays out.</blockquote>
And then Brand asked:
<blockquote>Is Thomas around on this board? I'd love to hear from him about that.</blockquote>
Now, I realize this was like 50+ posts back, but it's not my fault you guys are in such a hurry.  Anyway, I'm assuming that folks are still interested in my take...<br/><br/>Interestingly this situation that came up in our <i>Nine Worlds</i> game isn't, in my mind, really about gender at all.  There likely was some discomfort on my end, but that arises from my general discomfort with visceral romantic interaction.  That is, I don't do in-character romantic interaction with <i>anyone</i> very well.  There's a long, relatively drawn-out personal explanation for this, but it's not really related to the topic at hand.  Curious people are free to hit me up by email or something.<br/><br/>Now, at the risk of running this off topic, I will point out that the <i>primary</i> source of (for lack of a better word) disorientation I experienced with this episode was the radical realignment of my expectations and assumed structure for the narrative at hand.  I had begun with one sense of who my character was, and later fictional events began pushing me in another direction.  The best way I could see to reconcile the two positions was, interestingly, for the wife to have died of-camera.<br/><br/>Needless to say, Fred's taking over of the character obviated that and has forced a re-evaluation of where I want things to go from here.  Further, while the character was just an NPC (and moreover, an NPC with no real ties to any character but my own) I had a lot more leeway with ascribing motivations and actions to her.  Now that she's a PC I feel that I have a lot less freedom to decide what she does and why.<br/><br/>Basically I was planning to side-step a number of complex issues I just didn't feel like dealing with in this game, and it's looking like that won't be an option.  Ah well.<br/><br/>Back to the topic at hand.  About 18 months ago I started a thread on the Forge with a similar purpose of discussion: <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forum/index.php?topic=12903.0" rel="nofollow">Reasons for cross-gender play</a>.  The conclusion I reached at the time doesn't really feel all that valid anymore, but it was an interesting one nonetheless.  I proposed at the time that I chose to play female characters as a way of signaling a specific disinterest in romantic items in my part of the story.  That is, male characters were a signal from me that romance was okay, and female characters that it wasn't.<br/><br/>While, as I said, this doesn't feel entirely valid to me anymore, I must note that male characters of mine still tend to be involved in romantic stuff while female characters (the vast majority at least) are not.<br/><br/>I assume that this dichotemy arises from my personal ideas on gender roles such that I'm much more comfortable playing out romances from the "male" role, while I'm rather uncomfortable playing them out from the "female" role.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            I would like to say that I don't feel that I railroaded Thomas into allowing me to take Meg as a PC, but that's up to him to confirm; also, it's early enough in this PC's history that if it's going to cause a problem I can make a different PC.<br/>
<br/>
If you listen to the recordings of this game, you'll see that my play of Fell usually avoided any interaction with the other PC's.  That was a big mistake, and I picked up Meg in order to try to repair that mistake.<br/>
<br/>
As for playing out romances from the female role... I wouldn't have taken Meg as a PC if I didn't think I could do a passable job of it, and if I didn't find the prospect interesting.  Given the events that Aristo and Hecate have already been through, not to mention Fell and Princess Pia, I could not expect that Meg's inclusion as a PC was NOT going to involve romance.                        </div>

                            So, I typed this up once, but it got eaten, and I'm somewhat surprised I managed to get the courage up to do it again (you'll see why, I hope).  Anyway...<blockquote>What about a lesbian relationship? If the other player was a woman? If the other player was a man?

There are two questions here: 1) How do I react to the gender of the player, and 2) How would I react to sexuality of the character (and the ensuing assumption of traditional gender roles)?<br/><br/>I'll take them in order:<br/><br/>Interestingly, at least as far as I can tell, (1) doesn't really impact my play, at least not in obvious ways.  Whether the player is male or female isn't nearly as important as my relationship with that player.  Though I will note, since I find it interesting, that there isn't a direct (if there is at all) correlation between intimacy in the relationship and intimacy I'm comfortable with in-game.  Some of my closest friends I would be way more uncomfortable doing intimate character interaction with than you, Brand.  And, as cool as you seem, I don't really know you.  Interesting, huh?<br/><br/>There's actually an interestinghidden second part of (1) I should address: is there a difference in my comfort level when engaging a PC vs an NPC.  I'd have to say there is, and I think I may know at least part of why.  In traditional play, you can "throw away" an NPC.  If you decide that things just aren't going as you wish, it's possible to drop the character from play simply by not bringing them up anymore.  This isn't true with PCs.  You're stuck with them.  Thus, it feels "safer" (whether it really is or not) to engage with NPCs because you can always eject.<br/><br/>I hesitate to address (2) because it tends to generate pretty negative reactions in people who don't know me and thus can't put this in context, but it's relevant so...  Gay/lesbian relationships aren't something that I've dealt with to date, and not something I ever really plan/want to deal with.  The reason for this is that I have a personal (read: moral and religious) problem with homosexuality, and that I'm uncomfortable enough with it that I don't want to really explore it personally.<br/><br/>(Quick aside: if you are offended by this stance please, please, <i>please</i> contact me via email or something.  I'd like to have a chance to explain myself before I destroy any relationships, or even potential relationships, but I feel that it's not really on topic here.)<br/><br/>I should note, also in the interest of completeness, that I'm not really bothered by other people exploring such things in games I'm involved in.  It's just that I don't, personally, engage in them very well.  It's an interesting reaction since there are a number of things I have personal/moral/religious objections to that I'm perfectly willing to explore in play...<br/><br/>Ben: re <i>Bliss Stage</i>, I seriously have that fluttery scared/excited feeling going on whenever I think about playing it with a specific set of people, and you're  a member of that set.<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

<code> Some of my closest friends I would be way more uncomfortable doing intimate character interaction with than you, Brand. And, as cool as you seem, I don't really know you. Interesting, huh?</code><br/>Fascinating! <br/><br/>I think for me it depends on the friend. I rarely have problems playing romantic or sexual relationships with female players in my play group Ã¢â‚¬â€œ even when their husbands are in the game. But the guys? The guys are hit and miss. Oddly, I think my comfort level often has to do with their comfort level Ã¢â‚¬â€œ if they seem on edge, I may get nervous. If they seem okay, I'll probably stay okay. <br/><br/>Playing big gender-sex stuff with strangers, otoh, is interesting. I often spend the first interval of time in such a game figuring out how comfortable the other person is, how far I can push before putting them on edge, and then seeing if I can push a little farther. I don't try to make them uncomfortable, really, but I do try to see if they're really uncomfortable with it or if they just think they <i>would be/should be</i> uncomfortable with it. <br/><code> Thus, it feels "safer" (whether it really is or not) to engage with NPCs because you can always eject. </code>Interesting again. Though I'm thinking this is something that should be brought up elsewhere, as it isn't direct to gender and sex, but gets into a lot of other issues to. Still, it's a good observation! <br/><br/>As for the moral issues, that is both a powerful and a worthwhile answer! I also find it very interesting that you make the choice for yourself, but do not enforce your own choice on other people in your game. Is that because you don't feel you have a right to dictate their part of the game, or because that is the way you live your life in general? I mean, is it really about personal choice or is it about feeling socially obligated to not speak up about it? <br/><br/>And thanks for your replies, that did indeed take some guts!                        </div>

                            Another interesting factoid:<br/>
<br/>
I find I'm much more comfortable playing actively sexual characters when they are female.  I find the ideal of active male sexuality in roleplaying to be somewhat creepy.  This is definitely a socialization thing.  Female sexuality is mysterious and exciting.  Male sexuality is dangerous and suspect.<br/>
<br/>
Take a character I wrote for in an online freeform game with Shreyas, Thomas, and Josh K: Ruhi Nankachema, who came from a matriarchical culture (modeled on the Mosuo in ChinaÃ¯Â¼â€° where women have many lovers throughout their lifetime and are firmly in charge of the whole sex thing. Sex for her was normal and expected, which freaked out some of the other characters.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I don't think I would be comfortable playing or writing for a male version of that character, because I would feel like a creepy asshole.  I would worry that people would conflate my character with me and think that I was really a creepy asshole on the inside, and that's what was coming through.  But when I'm playing female characters, I don't worry about that.<br/>

                            That's too bad, Jonathan.  It can be cool to play a philandering man, and you shouldn't feel like a creepy asshole for it.  Both my James Bond 007 campaign from last year, and my "Brawny Thews" Conan one-shot were aimed at bringing out more male sexuality.  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think it's fairly common for my PCs to be interested in sex either way, but usually the circumstances of the campaign are such that they don't get any.  I was going to say that my female characters get some more than my male characters do -- but I don't think that's true as a generalization.  It just happens that I currently have a female PC who's in a relationship, but it's not typical.  Past female PCs have often been interested in sex but simply don't get any.                        </div>

That is to say, is it set up by you or the others at the table conciously or un so that the character can have an interest in sex, but won't cross any lines due to the fact that they just don't get any? <br/><br/>Maybe a specific example or two?

<em>...we talked about the situation and agreed to set up some social perameters for when situations like that came up in the future. And in that game, sex issues did come up over and over again, and ironically we never had to use the new language we'd set up. It's like once we'd been through the fire and looked each other in the eye and talked about it afterwards things cleared up and we knew we could do it again.</em><br/><br/>This is my experience with FLFS First Session discussions every single time.  You discuss discuss discuss, and then never actually reference the discussion again.  And yet the game doesn't actually tread over the stuff that you talked about, either.  This applies to sex as much as  heroism, epic-ness, gritty feel, wide-angle scope, close-up issues, dramatics, or whatever other thing you talk about in setting up the game.  It feels like it's a needless gesture when you're doing it, but everything <em>just works</em> afterwards.  It's weird.<br/><br/>Also, Jonathan, you should give the active-male-sexuality character a try specifically in a setting/genre where that's appropriate and kind of part of the cheesy appeal.  Playing a flamboyant pirate who woos all the ladies, for instance, can kind of get you over that 'hump' (pardon the term) and let you play another male character with the libido dial turned down a little, but not all the way down to zero.                        </div>

                            Josh, <br/><br/>Funny how going in ready keeps the problems down in the long run, isn't it? <br/><br/>Also, everyone: <br/><br/>Can we try to refrain from "fixing" people here? If we have questions, ask them, and observations about why things work and don't work are all cool -- but if someone says something about their thing and doesn't flag it as a problem, let us not assume that it is a problem. <br/><br/>Jonathan, <br/><br/>Mulling.

                            Like Brand and Thomas, the amount to which I'm comfortable with overt sexual content in a game depends on who I'm playing with.  But interestingly enough, it's only a little bit about the person who's playing my partner - it's much more about the tone and tenor of the people who are watching the scene, how comfortable I feel being sexual in front of them, and whether I think they're likely to interrupt the suspension of disbelief that makes IC sex scenes, well, IC as opposed to me getting all sexy with someone who isn't actually my lover.<br/><br/>I'm perfectly capable of playing a sex scene with any of the players in my group, or with strangers (given a brief where-are-your-limits discussion), as long as they're willing to stay in character or else mutually agree that we're going to do a very distant OOC description.  But ask me to be sexual IC, and then break my concentration on the scene?  All of a sudden the whole thing falls apart.  Sex is a really, really touchy subject, and it's hard for me to expose myself as a sexual person in front of a group.  As long as I can stay entirely in character, it's fine: my characters have done everything from kiss-and-fade-to-black to fairly explicit nookie action, depending on what the character, the group and the game demanded.  But make me feel like it's <i>me</i>, and all of a sudden the sense of story is gone, and I just feel like I'm doing some insincere dirty talking and being laughed at for my pains.<br/><br/>I do try to encourage my male players to experiment with the male libido, though - I can see where the "woo, male sexuality comes off as creepy and aggressive" thing comes from, but a good GM/group can provide opportunities to be more complex than that.  I try to provide opportunities for my PCs (male and female) to be aggressively sexual, but that aren't necessarily about gender, violence and power.  Of course, it helps that I'm running a game set in ancient Rome, where male sexuality was a much more fluid thing . . . and the PCs spent most of the first story arc naked, since they all met up in the baths.<br/><br/>I know that I've created compelling story reasons to get into the down-and-dirty of sex and gender when I've got four straight and gay male players actively debating about whose character is going to penetrate whose, and in front of whom, and what this means for their relationship and long-term political status, and whether the one female character of the four can actually use sex for status in the same way or whether she can only get herself in trouble by getting involved.  Fun fun.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

Now, for me the partner matters to -- because if they're sitting there squirming and wanting to go away its no fun. But if the partner is even moderatly okay, it is the audience that makes or breaks it. <br/><br/>As for the Rome game, that gets back to something that I was poking Matt Wilson about earlier: it sounds like your players use your setting in order to play with gender roles in interesting ways. They step out of their normal shoes and into those of another culture with some success, yes? <br/><br/>How common to others find this? When you play a game in ancient Greece, for example, do your players try to think of gender in ancient Greek terms? Do they not try at all? Do they try and fail? <br/><br/>Also, have you ever deliberatly played a setting/not played a setting because of the way it would deal with gender/sex? Such as playing in Tekumel so you could do the dancing demon sex, or not playing in James Bond in order to not have to be all Mr. Penis?<br/><br/>Edit: Oh Jess, more questions! <br/><br/>With regards to the "talking dirty to someone who isn't my partner" issue -- what if the other player is your partner? Make it better or worse to be talking dirty in front of an audience? What if there is no audience?

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>Questions! <br/><br/>Would you be interested in playing a sexualized male character if the point of the character was exploring (say, Sorcerer style) the problematics of male sexuality? Or would that still feel creepy to you? <br/><br/>What about a virago woman who was a male in all but sexual body characteristics in a swords and sorcery game? That is to say, a boy with breasts who acts and fights and fucks like Conan -- but just happens to be biologically female? Or what about a lesbian who is agressively sexual?  <br/><br/>Also, can you give me some more detail about what you mean by female sexuality being mysterious and exciting? Are you talking in mythic terms? Physical terms? Social norm terms? All/none of the above?                        </div>

<i>As for the Rome game, that gets back to something that I was poking Matt Wilson about earlier: it sounds like your players use your setting in order to play with gender roles in interesting ways. They step out of their normal shoes and into those of another culture with some success, yes?</i><br/><br/>Yes, that's definitely true - but it took a little situational pushing.  It wasn't just the setting, it was that we (the GMs) made a point of incorporating the whole picture of the culture into people from the very beginning of character creation, and that a couple of players went out of their way to research what their characters' sexuality might have been like, just as they went out of their way to research appropriate biographical and historical events.  (What this means in practice is that I've got books on bisexuality in ancient Rome and sexual practices in 'magic' and cult rites right alongside my histories of the early Church.  Fun.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>)<br/><br/>Once we had characters who had authentic and interesting sexual identities, we had to give them situations where it would come up.  It took a while for all our players to get actively involved, but like I said, they're a great group and pretty much up for anything, as long as it makes a good story.<br/><br/>Not that we're doing perfectly, mind you.  For one thing, we're still working with pretty modern definitions of sexual identity.  ("I'm straight, he's gay, she's bisexual.")  It's hard to remember to portray that in Rome, you can have sex with men and not be gay, and for that not to be hypocritical - just for example.  But we're always trying to learn about the things we don't yet understand.<br/><br/>God, it sounds like our game is full of sex, doesn't it?  Really, we've only had the odd orgy here and there . . . .<br/><br/><i>Also, have you ever deliberatly played a setting/not played a setting because of the way it would deal with gender/sex? Such as playing in Tekumel so you could do the dancing demon sex, or not playing in James Bond in order to not have to be all Mr. Penis?</i><br/><br/>I've never avoided a setting because of how it dealt with sex, though I've totally played <i>7th Sea</i> for the swashbuckling romance strewn with a liberal helping of seduction.  I've definitely avoided settings because of how they deal with gender, though.  I don't run games in which it isn't plausible to have at least 50% female NPCs, and I will only play in them if I can have a rich, interesting female character who isn't the "weird crazy exception-woman."  And of course I can't come up with an example off the top of my head, but I know that I've ditched games for this reason at least twice.<br/><br/><i>With regards to the "talking dirty to someone who isn't my partner" issue -- what if the other player is your partner? Make it better or worse to be talking dirty in front of an audience? </i><br/><br/>I don't role-play romantic relationships with my partner in games that aren't one-on-one, but not for reasons that have anything to do with sex.  We tried this once and we ended up hogging the spotlight and upsetting the other players.  It's not that we're not comfortable being in romantic relationships IC - it's that we're not good at doing it without getting into GM's-girlfriend/GM's-boyfriend syndrome, which we can avoid at other times.<br/><br/>Before you ask, we've never been players in the same game.  Either he runs games for our group or I do, or we run together.  I suspect we'd be okay playing out a sexual/romantic relationship in a game where we were both players, since there wouldn't be GM-attention/spotlight issues, but we haven't yet had a chance.  Want to come out to New York and run a highly experimental sex-gender oriented game for us?  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><i>What if there is no audience? That is to say, what if you're in a one-on-one game with just your partner?</i><br/><br/>My partner and I actually always have a long-term one-on-one game going, of one sort or another.  In these, we've explored all kinds of romantic and sexual relationships, from ones that are pretty close to our own to some stuff that we would never actually consider doing ourselves.  Our characters have had self-sacrificing relationships, abusive relationships, loving relationships, gender-swapping relationships, hot gay sex, hot straight sex, hot monkey sex, you name it.  I really don't have any inhibitions role-playing sex when it's one-on-one with him.  I mean, it's not like he hasn't seen it all already in real life.  <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/><br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Jess,<br/><br/>I think you just gave me one of like three really solid reasons I've heard for deep background research into a game that I've been able to fully accept since I went all hippy-Nar-indie. Awesome. Do you think you'd be able to do that with a constructed background? (Like, um, Tekumel or Forgotten Realms.) Or with a background you constructed fully with the other players before the game started? <br/><br/>For examples of games where it's hard to be the female PC without being the odd exception, what about, say, Pendragon -- a game I love dearly, but that can be odd around gender depending on the group. Do you have any experience with it? Any thoughts about the relationship of knightly quests in the Dark Ages and gender identity? <br/><br/>As for the rest of it, both always being opposite your partner in the GM/Player divide and always having long term one-on-one games going, I find that you are again, much like me. No shock at this point. I had some questions I could have asked about that, but I think it would be moving out of the realms of gender in RPGs and into the realm of relationship counciling -- so I'm going to leave it for now. <br/><br/>Though I sort of want to make a new thread about playing one-on-one sex games. Maybe when I get back from Chicago -- wouldn't be right to drop that puppy and then leave for a week.<br/><br/>As for GMing for you... hell, it's not inconceivable. Toronto isn't that far from New York, and Mo and I do travel a lot. Maybe someday.                        </div>

<i>Do you think you'd be able to do that with a constructed background? (Like, um, Tekumel or Forgotten Realms.) Or with a background you constructed fully with the other players before the game started?</i><br/><br/>That's a solid, er, maybe.  I think I'd probably draw on real-world research in the <i>Tekumel</i> case by looking at some of the cultures that the game draws on, and in the constructed-background case by figuring out what cultures I wanted to draw from.  Somehow, making things up from scratch when it comes to sex and gender always leads me down the same roads I'm already comfortable with, as opposed to pushing me in new directions.  The reason I like to set games in specific (if highly narratively hacked) cultures is to help me tell stories that I wouldn't think to tell otherwise.  Just making up my own sex/gender issues wouldn't necessarily push me - I need some outside force for that, whether that's a player or GM with a strong agenda, or historical/cultural research.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if I were playing in a fantasy or constructed background, I'd use the research much more as inspiration than anything else, and I'd feel comfortable hacking it much further than I currently do.<br/><br/><i>For examples of games where it's hard to be the female PC without being the odd exception, what about, say, Pendragon -- a game I love dearly, but that can be odd around gender depending on the group. Do you have any experience with it? Any thoughts about the relationship of knightly quests in the Dark Ages and gender identity?</i><br/><br/>I've never played Pendragon (mostly due to lack of interest in my group) but yeah, that's definitely a game that I'd think twice about.  I'd probably try it and see how it actually worked, since it seems like a really cool game, or hack the setting to make it fit my requirements for a game.<br/><br/>As for your question about knightly quests and gender identity . . . um, that's a whole dissertation right there. and I'm not sure I can say anything that's both intelligent and brief.  I <i>can</i> say that I've played out the knightly quest story as a female knight in an only-somewhat-modified Dark Ages setting, and it was a huge deal for the character.  She ended up becoming a somewhat unenthusiastic lesbian, as she felt that her identity as a knight was more important to her than her identity as a woman.  After all, being a woman was devalued and being a knight was a great thing!  So of course, she had to find a ladylove and rescue maidens and all that, but she was really, really conflicted about it.  She ended up sleeping with her squire because she could count on him keeping his mouth shut about her liking men.  But I'm not sure if I have anything to say about the general case, because it's the specifics of an individual story that I find interesting . . . and that's the one story I've got.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/><i>Though I sort of want to make a new thread about playing one-on-one sex games.</i><br/><br/>I'll wait for you to get back, so if I don't see one in a week or so, I'll get one started.

Sleep is also good.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Mo: <br/><br/>This is the part where I lose all my indie cred by admitting that I've only gotten my group to actually <i>play</i> Dogs once.  Time is the reason, not lack of interest, though!  I don't have a problem playing games in which women take on (or resist) traditional gender roles.  I don't need all my female characters to be space pilots or barbarian warriors or wizards or genius hackers.  I just need the game to support stories in which women, and women's lives, and women's stories are valued.  I'm perfectly happy playing within and against the constraints that Dogs provides, because those narrative constraints are true to the setting, but don't exclude women from being a part of the story in genuine, authentic and interesting ways.  Does that make sense?<br/><br/>For me, the gender stuff in Dogs actually has a lot of personal resonance, too.  I grew up in a religious community with very strong gender roles.  While my own family encouraged me to be eccentric and independent, I watched the girls around me get married and start having babies and stay at home and take care of the house and their men, not because they wanted to but because That's What You Do.  My cousin was considered an old maid when she was unmarried at 23, and now that she's married has had four babies in five years.  An unmarried woman is not considered an adult in my birth community, not in the way an unmarried man is.  So Dogs really makes me want to play for very personal reasons, to explore some of what I grew up with and to see what other ways of dealing with that might have been.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            On the subject of DitV and the gender politics within, I've found it interesting that as I'm running it some of the conflicts that I've enjoyed most are centered around the restricted role of women in that setting.  Which is not to say that they were about the role of women, but they inhabited that sphere of 'women's business'.  For example, we had a kick arse conflict that had the whole group into the back and forth between the one female PC who is described as big into all the traditional woman's stuff in the setting, and a female NPC.  It didn't even get to speaking for the first couple of raises, as they duked it out by means of who had the best method of storing pickles, and whether there was dust on the shelves of the kitchen dresser.  Not saying anything, but each just noticing, and noticing that the other was noticing.  I was really jazzed about it, because it was the sort of stuff that most people gloss over in order to get to the killing things, and yet we made it matter big time.<br/>

<p>GRR COOKIE EXPIRED POST GONE GRR</p>
<p>Brand,</p>
<p>In case you haven't noticed, I'm liking this thread. Makes me wanna go out and <em>play</em> dammit.</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>How common to others find this? When you play a game in ancient Greece, for example, do your players try to think of gender in ancient Greek terms? Do they not try at all? Do they try and fail?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><em>If</em> they try, they usually fail. Historical verisimilitude, or whatever the heck it's called, was in my experience problematic exactly because of the gender connotations. So we glossed over that part and were playing in a "classic" fantasy world, which is to say a world with the equivalent of our beloved western late-20th-century moral system, gender codes, and sometimes even sociopoliticoeconomical structure. It's the setting = color equation, which is espoused IMHO by mainstream roleplaying (certainly WOTC, to a lesser extent WW).</p>
<blockquote class="UserQuote"><div class="QuoteText">
<p>Also, have you ever deliberatly played a setting/not played a setting because of the way it would deal with gender/sex? Such as playing in Tekumel so you could do the dancing demon sex, or not playing in James Bond in order to not have to be all Mr. Penis?</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Maybe, and maybe. Don't know if this counts as setting, but I am itching to play <em>Nicotine Girls</em>. I almost ran Victor Gijsbers <em>Vampires</em> in a local convention once, but decided against it, as I felt it would be unfair to the players. I probably won't play in Ron Edwards' Azk'Arn setting because sex combined with Geiger/Cronenberg imagery is too much for me to stomach. And as if it even needs to be said, I so won't play the game that must not be named.</p>

                            Claire: that sort of thing is precisely what I mean.  Yes, the role of women in the setting is restricted - but it's possible and plausible to tell stores in which the world of traditional women <i>matters</i>.  I'm perfectly willing to play in a setting where women aren't equal <b>in the game world</b> to men, but I'm not willing to play in a setting where women can't be interesting <b>to the players</b> without undermining the setting entirely.  The fact is, none of the conflicts that DitV suggests exclude women at all.  Women can have issues with stewardship, gender roles, love/marriage, polygamy or money, just like men can.  Their issues will play out somewhat differently, of course . . . and may involve pickles.  But there's enough flex in the game to have a range of female experiences, and to include all of them in meaningful conflicts that matter to both players and characters.<br/><br/>Mark: what is the game that must not be named?<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Claire, <br/><br/>That's very cool! It reminds me of Tony's descriptions about how he once had Dog's players freaking out because they went into a very together, busy-body, woman's house and found that it hadn't been dusted in at least a week. <br/><br/>Wait... was this the same group? If not, that's a very cool coincidence!<br/><br/>Jeff, <br/><br/>I too am a dirty male, and I too endorse that story. <br/><br/>Back to Everyone, <br/><br/>This brings up another question: how many games that you have played in give a proper focus to "women's conflicts" rather than "men's conflicts" in the game? By which I mean, how often does the all about killing things trump the connection to the community things? Or the issues of procreation over domination? Or any of the issues that John Kim brought up in <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/theory/gender/gametext.html" rel="nofollow">this here essay</a>? (Don't worry, it's not long.) <br/><br/>And, now that I've brought them up with quotesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ What are women's conflicts, and what are men's conflicts, and how do the gender roles of the people playing the characters figure into that?

<code>What are women's conflicts, and what are men's conflicts, and how do the gender roles of the people playing the characters figure into that? If at all?</code><br/><br/>I think that's going to vary hugely based on setting.  In a modern game that's going to be very different from a fantasy game which is going to be different from Dogs which is going to be different from ancient Rome which is going to be different from Nobilis.<br/><br/>One of my mantras in my Rome game is that violence is never an end to your problems, but only a start to them.  (My players have learned to be very scared of getting into a fight - not because they might lose their characters, but because their characters will end up dealing with the consequences for weeks!)  While this decision had nothing to do with gender, it's helped encourage my players to look for other solutions to problems, and to see problems that can't be solved with violence as interesting ones.<br/><br/>But really, the only definition that I'm willing to stick to for what 'women's conflicts' and 'men's conflicts' are is this: they are the things that female and male characters can reasonbly care about within the setting without being the weird exception to their gender.  Depending on the culture and setting of the game, this could vary wildly.  In my ancient Rome game, for example, the upper-class women are very concerned with family honor, taxes (yes!), education, and quiet means of influencing politics through things like political poetry.  Lower-class women could work as anything from a lawyer to a doctor to a baker to a farmer or laborer.  Because I refuse to run a game where women can't be important, we've had storylines dealing with these things (one major arc dealt with essentially a political cartoonist sponsored by a powerful woman), just as we've had a couple of stories dealing with the army or the Senate, where women couldn't do all that much.<br/><br/>'Women's issues' does not have to mean gender issues.  I'll always have characters who are in some way resisting their gender role, both men and women alike!  But as long as the 'normal' women in the setting can have interesting conflicts suggested by the game, I'm a happy gal.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Just to make it clear, I was playing in Claire's game at the time. Loved the conflict; also an earlier one with the same player concerning her character's relationship with her father. <br/><br/>I'm not so knowledgable about RPG development history, but I know it's only since HQ (2000) that I've had the tools to tackle anything like that. You know, generally RPGs have been a combat system with some extra rules wrapped around them. They've drawn from archetypal male stories like the Arthurian cycle. Being as how I'm a pervert who likes rolling dice for stuff, it's much easier to make such conflicts interesting when violence is systemically just like anything else.                        </div>

Not now. <br/><br/>So, how do you think that whole setting=color issue plays into things like what Jess and Claire are talking about? Do you think it hampers or helps the ability to make interesting female characters? Characters of other genders?                        </div>

                            As a different perspective, the one time I played Dogs I felt incredibly restricted and didn't enjoy it because of the role/view of women in that society.  It meant that my dog *could not do* things the male dogs could do simply because she was a woman.  It meant that male (and some female) NPC's were less likely to give her the authority she deserved because she was a woman.  It cut down my character options because there are things that were just unacceptable for a woman, but were fine for a man.  That double-standard drove me up the wall.  I think, maybe, this would be the only game I would flat-out refuse to play a female character in, if I ever play again.<br/>

                            Hey Nancy: Your experience kinda runs contrary to my own. I dunno if this was addressed in the book and it just was "played out wrong" by the GM, or if it was a misunderstanding, or if the book really does say to play that way. However, in all the Dogs games that I played:<br/><br/>Men (not dogs) had rather restrictive codes of conduct.<br/>Women (not dogs) had more restrictive codes of conduct.<br/>However, a DOG, Male or Female, basically had a "get out of social rules/roles free" card. Female Dogs had no requirement to engage in the same behavior as non-dog women, as they were Dogs, which was almost a seperation between Man and Angel.  Whatever the Dog did while they had that coat on, they were infalliable, and effectively a hand of god that were totally above the normal social rules of man and woman.<br/><br/>But again, that's how it was always explained to me (and women dogs in our games always were as empowered as male dogs)... I don't recall seeing it stated out either way in the book, though.<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>

Andy, that was basically how it was explained to me, as well.  Dogs, I mean.<br/>

Nancy, I'm sorry you had to play the game like that.  It sounds like it sucked.<br/>

                            Nancy, <br/><br/>That sucks! <br/><br/>For the record, when I run Dogs the women usually end up taking over the story -- not being marginalized. Heck, in a recent game two female Dogs stood down a mob of a dozen armed men who were going to lynch an old woman who had them all scared to death! <br/><br/>So, to the questions! Do you think that your experience was because of how the game is set up at a fundemental level, because of how your GM ran it, or some combination of the two? Can you give maybe a specific example or two of things that deprotagonized your character, and maybe some comments about how they could have been handled better?                        </div>

Or would that still feel creepy to you?</i><br/><br/>I don't know that I'm especially creeped out by that concept, but I'm not especially interested in it either.  Like, my problem is that I think male sexuality is creepy, so then exploring how male sexuality is creepy seems like not much of a good time.  Revelling in the creepiness!  And it's just reinforcing my feelings about creepy sexualized men.  Granted, I'm writing <i>Vesperteen</i> to be about teenage sin, which includes a lot of sexuality, and I'm doing this partially to work through my own issues, I think.  But playing the kind of game you describe doesn't sound like a fun time.<br/><br/><i>What about a virago woman who was a male in all but sexual body characteristics in a swords and sorcery game? That is to say, a boy with breasts who acts and fights and fucks like Conan -- but just happens to be biologically female? Or what about a lesbian who is agressively sexual?</i><br/><br/>I could probably do that.  It's not a personality thing in my head.  I have no trouble roleplaying aggressive female sexuality (or agressive male sexuality in a female body).  It really is a gender thing.  The only creepiness I'd feel would be if people started giving me weird judgemental looks, but that kills any roleplaying, really.<br/><br/><i>Also, can you give me some more detail about what you mean by female sexuality being mysterious and exciting? Are you talking in mythic terms? Physical terms? Social norm terms? All/none of the above?</i><br/><br/>Hmm, not physical terms so much (though, of course, when you're a kid, that's certainly the case).  I guess I was just thinking about what female and male sexuality tend to signify in most stories (granted, most classic literature is by white men, so...).  Male sexuality tends to be destructive.  Men can't control their lust.  It makes them aggressive and jealous.  They do bad shit.  They end up killing or raping people.  Or unwanted male sexuality just makes women feel icky.  That kind of thing.  Female sexuality tends to be empowering, when women take control of it themselves.  They go have sex with the people they want to, instead of who society chooses.  They sometimes use it as a tool to get what they want.  And it gives them power over men.  It's a symbol of their freedom and making choices for themselves.  Etc.  I don't know if that's "mysterious and enticing" exactly, but that's what my brain's spitting out right now.<br/><br/>I'm talking to Ben right now about Feminism in general and what I'm planning to post over on his blog is this: I guess I feel that Feminism gave (and continues to give) women a way of rewriting society's rules and expectations of them.  A lot of things have changed for women in the last 50-100 years and they are continuing to change, and women are talking about it and trying to figure out what new developments mean for the women's movement, etc.  But, what's missing is a movement where men start rethinking traditional conceptions of masculinity and try to figure out what it means to be a man in modern times.  Instead, I think, men have just been defensively responding to Feminism, struggling to hold onto traditional male values that we think are actually positive, and trying to convince ourselves that male characteristics and sexuality are not bad.  And that's not a very productive tactic and obviously I've not been able to convince myself that an active male sexuality can be non-creepy, but hopefully I'll get there eventually.  So yeah.                        </div>

                            Jonathan, <br/><br/>Funny enough, my personal experience is that many men have, as a result of both Feminism and other movements, been doing a lot of work to re-examine what it is to be a man. But, rather than make this a debate, let me go find something Mr. Willson posted earlier....<br/><code>And yes, I think masculinity in the real world has ground to a halt, while femininity has left it in the dust. Menfolk can only express themselves via anger and drinking and that Willis/Eastwood squinty thing. Anything else leads to wussy contamination.</code><br/>And over on anyway, he said:<code>Identifying and exploring what's masculine and 'being a man' and all that in gaming is a big chunk of part 2 of my manifesto.</code><br/>So, if'n we want to really explore what it is to be a man, and to have masculine genders, and all that jazz, how do we go about it? <br/><br/>Jonathan, Matt -- what are some issues of masculenity that you really want to be able to nail in a game that you have been able to? That you haven't been able to? Is it easier to do it in a game with or without women? Or with only women? <br/><br/>For everyone else --  we've had women saying that they chose to play women in games because they want to say things about women and women's places in society and gaming culture. So, how do you feel about men doing the same thing? Can they both be done at one time? Do they both have to be done at the same time? (ie, can you only play a man in relation to someone else playing a woman, or a gay man in relation to another gay man?) Would you feel better about it if it was exploring sex (man|woman), gender (um, lots), or the concept of being an adult vs. non-adult? <br/><br/>And, to be nasty, what do you think that says about you?                        </div>

                            I'm strongly in favor of men doing the same thing, as long as they do it with the same respect to women that I show to male players and characters.  I try to encourage the men in my game to at least consider these issues when they make characters, and to provide situations in-game which make those issues come up in complicated ways.  But if they don't want to - well, it's not my problem.  Not everyone has to care about every issue that there is, and I wouldn't judge anyone for this being an issue that they don't think much about.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Flora, above.  Not a woman, but a cartoon drawn as a fantasy by a man.  She embodies the two strongest male fantasies about women -- Madonna and Whore -- depending on whether she's on or off camera.  And, through that, she's struggling to find an identity, a real self.  She's the most realistically drawn character in the show and yet she's basically hollow, and knows it.<br/>

I think that the tie to "how should we as hetero men think about women, how should we fantasize about women, and how do we relate our fantasy women to real women?"<br/>

<br/>
When you play a female character, do you play the woman you want to be or the woman you want to be with or the woman you want have a torrid, one night fling with?  Why?<br/>

                            Ben,<br/><br/>This is the thread where I ask you questions, damnit! What made you think it was fair to ask me to reveal myself the way I'm asking you to reveal yourself? <br/><br/>::grumble::<br/><br/>Fine. I'll answer. <br/><br/>It depends on the game and what I'm doing. (Gee, Brand answers "It's contextual." Can we all die of the shock now?) When I'm PCing and NPCing the two answers are going to be very different. When I GM the answer is almost always going to be "whichever combination of those will make the character compelling for the situation and the PC in question." So when I'm setting up a rake to seduce Mo's character, he/she isn't going to have much to do with the man/woman I want to be -- or even the man/woman Mo wants to be with. It may, however, be much to do with the man/woman with whom Mo wants to have a fantasy affair (a different beast than a real affair). <br/><br/>But that's the cheap and easy answer, ain't it? What about when I PC a girl? To be honest, I've done all of the above. I've also been the woman I fear, and the woman I would fear being. Playing characters that scare me, that speak to my own faults and inadequacies is always a popular set of instruments for me. So playing characters that represent the things that I fear in the "other" and forcing myself to confront the issue is something I've done more than once. <br/><br/>When I was younger, so much younger than today, I used to play girls that were some version of my sexual fantasy woman. Of course, given who I was even as a teen, that usually meant Amazonian ass-kicker who was smart and tough as well as built like a brick house. The characters (usually) were the sort that didn't cause offense to the female players at the table, but I think it was painfully obvious that I fetishized them -- and the degree of sick on a pedestalness of the play may have been offputting to some of the girls. I recall, dimly, one girl saying something about how my character was like Cindy Crawford with a PhD*. At the time I took it as a compliment, but in retrospect I'm fairly sure it was a dig about how I was setting up a woman so fantastical she was as divorced from reality as the woman on the cover of Savant and Sorcerer.<br/><br/>Now days I still play sexualized women from time to time, but I try to do it without either fetishizing or debasing their sexuality or simplifying their issues. I probably have less experience with this than others, as I've been doing way more GMing than playing for the last 5 years, and so my total number of PCs is low Ã¢â‚¬â€œ meaning I haven't had a huge chance to play this type of character. I did one who was a seductress type, a femme fatal, who was a mixture of Madonna and whore herself, who ended up (against my expectations) having a history of sexual abuse that caused a lot of her trauma. She started out as a character I may have wanted to have a torrid fantasy affair with, and ended up as a character whom I wanted to hold while she cried. That was alsoÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ umÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ like a year ago. <br/><br/>My other "female" PC at this point is actually a gender-switcher that is tied to another character. Due to a magical geas the character has to assume the sex opposite that of hir master, so she's a girl when the master is a boy and a boy when the master is a girl. In both forms the character is highly sexualized and built to be both the boy and girl that you would want to fuck but wouldn't because you knew it was bad trouble. So the girl is certainly that tempting bit again, but the boy is tooÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and the whole thing is complicated by the fact that the character is basically the bound mount and companion of another character. <br/><br/>The other recent time that I played a girl, sex wasn't part of the make up at all. I didn't, oddly enough, sexualize the character much at all other than to say that she was moderately attractive, but not so pretty as to scare guys with low self confidence. This, however, was also in a game played with a largely gamist agenda by guys who aren't into deep characterization or story, and so I was much more interested in the characters ability to waste shit with her crossbow.<br/><br/>As for how I play male PCs towards female NPCs... that too depends a lot on the game and the situation. When Mo and I are playing a solo game in which there is sex and seduction going on fast and heavy, there is obviously going to be a heavily sexual relation and sexualization element towards some of the female NPCs. OTOH, in the Blue Rose oneshot that I played a few months back there was almost painfully little sexual attaction between my noble judge and his shy lady love, played moderatly uncomfortably by one of my friends as GM. <br/><br/>If I had to make a generalization... I'd say there is probably more overt and active sexual draw and sexuality towards female characters in game than towards the women in my actual life. Not a huge amount, neccisarily, but it certainly is there. Due to the fun of the libidinal nature of play, the fantasy element of story (how many WW games did I play where everyone was a voluptous satyr running about free and horny?), and the fact that most of the women I play with like sex in their games in order to intensify story (or just play about with sexuality) there is a more sexual focus on the characters. <br/><br/>But then, I also don't have any problem being sexually attracted to someone and still being a friend and seeing them as a subject rather than object, so I'm not fully sure what to say about that.<br/><br/>*Edit addition: I was dating the girl who made the comment.                        </div>

                            Sexual abuse . . . okay, there's a whole topic of questions by itself.<br/><br/>Brand, how did you realize that your seductress character had been sexually abused?  How did you deal with it, as her player, when you realized it?  Do you feel like that decision had anything to do with her assumption of sexual power and seduction?<br/><br/>Everyone: how do you find that creating characters with dysfunctional sexual natures or histories of sexual abuse relates to the sex/gender of the characters you create?  How does it come up in play?  Do you only see abused characters in play, or do people ever play sexual abusers?  And how do you deal with the out-of-game issues that it might raise for players with histories of sexual abuse of their own?                        </div>

The indication that women were property (Female Dogs have the right to refuse a man marriage means the other women don't), that abuse was normal (if the husband of a former Dog treats them badly they can expect that people will take their complaints seriously, which implies that it's not true for other women), plus some issues I have about the control and ownership issues that are raised by hierarchical polygyny. <br/><br/>Haven't I played in settings before in which women were abused, in which they were second class citizens, in which there was an oppressive level of patriarchic control and commodification of the female body and soul? Well, yeah, of course I have. Have I enjoyed playing in them? Yes. Have I fucked around with the gender issues that arose in them? Yeah, and (as Brand can attest to) in a pretty hardcore way.<br/><br/>So what's the difference?<br/><br/>Well, I'll tell you. In those other games, I generally would play around with stories in which I played female characters who pushed outside the structures, or who overcame their enculturation, or who became downright misanthropic and homicidal.  In Dogs though, even though I can become a Dog and step outside the traditional expectations of women in the Dogs' society, I am not a rebel. I do not transcend the expectations: I am expected through my office to enforce them. In the game Pride, the source of all evil, comes into gender roles when someone wants more than what their place in the society dictates. My job as a Dog is to eliminate Pride.<br/><br/>Could this tell a good story? Sure it could. Was it a story I wanted to pursue. No. At least, not yet. Did I want it to necessarily be the first story that I played in the Dogs world? No. Could I play a female character and not approach that story? No. At least not my first time around. So there it was: I told that story or a I played a male Dog. My first time out I didn't want to play a gender story, I wanted to play a Dog story. So I played a male Dog. The second time out, I didn't want to play a gender story, I wanted to play a different kind of Dog story, so I played a male Dog too.<br/><br/>With a lot of Dogs experience maybe one could play a female Dog that wasn't a gender issues story, but I'm still hard pressed on how to do it. That means there are a lot of things I can't do (as a player) because I'm playing a female Dog, even if, in the story, female Dogs are exempted.                        </div>

                            Before I answer Jess's questions (damnit, when did I become the respondee?) I have one other thing to add about Ben's question: <br/><br/>It occurs to me that when I play a character, PC or NPC, while I may find the character very sexy I don't actually want to fuck my own character. I have occasionally wanted to, which is sometimes odd I suppose, but then I'm not a big character immersionist. <br/><br/>From the talks I've had with my bisexual friends, this issue comes up for them as well. The divide between what you want to be and what you want to do can be a narrow one, and if you're sexually attracted to bodies of many kinds, it can get even narrower. <br/><br/>Anyone else have any thoughts on that? What it means to sexualize a character without being sexually attracted to them? What it means to sexualize them when you are sexually attracted to them? And how that relates to the spread between your gender and that of the character?                        </div>

                            Jess, <br/><br/>The dynamic of that character was quite interesting, but not fully under my control. I didn't create the character, I just played her. And I didn't instigate the child abuse, someone else suggested it. We were playing the Pool, they did an idea roll about something like her having a "funny uncle" and I ran with it. <br/><br/>The thing about it was that despite that there was, no doubt, a tie between this characters specific sexuality and the abuse that built up quite quickly in my mind due to relationships I've had with abused children and women who were abused as children. She had an agressive, predatory sexuality that early on spoke to me of someone who could have esteme in herself only when she was being lusted after by someone else. At first this was sort of just playing to type, but as the game went on it got deeper and deeper. <br/><br/>It was a bit of a difficult issue for me -- but it was worse for one of the other players. He was a guy who would pick up at clubs, and apaprently he saw a lot of his former one-night stands in my character. To be confronted with the idea that some of the women he was with may have been doing what they did because they were subconciously repeating an abusive pattern that started when they were a child was horrifying to him. For that matter, it was horrifying to me. The male fantasy of the sexual woman who wants you and comes after you so that all you have to do is sit there and let her seduce you was suddenly turned into the realization that everyone has reasons for what they do -- and for some those reasons are not healthy. Some of our fantasy women are abuse victims. And what does that make us? <br/><br/>OTOH, one of the girls in the game afterwards told me she was really weirded by the whole thing. She saw what I was doing and approved, but was odded out by the fact that it was a man doing it. She said it felt too much like me judging female sexuality and finding it sick at the core. We didn't get to talk about it much, but one thing she did volunteer (I didn't ask) was that if the character were played exactly the same way by a female player, she didn't think she would have the same reaction. <br/><br/>For the next question: I've never played a PC sexual abuser -- that one is way too much a hot button for me. I have played PCs that were abused both in backstory and in the course of the game, both male and female PCs. <br/><br/>As for dealing with players who have been abused: that's why I usually set up some expectations about the game before play -- including some kind of safeword for those who need something to stop right there so we can talk about it.                        </div>

I think your description of your difficulty is really clear and really insightful, though, and it's definitely made me think more critically about what I find interesting about the game, and how I can separate my concerns as a player from my character concerns.                        </div>

                            Jess,<br/><br/>I suspect that once I've had the chance to play out a Dog for a bit and just have fun in the experience of being a Dog and have gotten my feet wet and myself comfortable in the system and the setting, that I may very well want to play a female Dog to find that story and see how hard I can hit it, and get hit by it. I get why you'd want to.<br/><br/>There's also this picture I found that simply must be the vis rep for one of my characters and she's got God's Watchdog written all over her. So that might tempt me over sooner if I had the opportunity.                        </div>

                            Hey, I want to jump into the Dogs conversation.  If it makes things easier (since there's already a Jess) you can just call me peaseblossom, or pease, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we already know that I tend to jump into gender issues feet first.  When I played Dogs I played an alcoholic lesbian.  She had been secretly in love with her best friend, the woman who made her coat, but when she went off to be a Dog her friend got married and was beaten to death by her husband.<br/>
<br/>
My character was straddling the cutting edge between "I have to do what's right because I'm a Dog" and "What I do is right because I'm a Dog".  Unfortunately, we only played a one-shot, and while the gm did do a great job of confronting me with an attractive young, rebellious girl who definitely had what it took to become a Dog herself, other plot points intervened and we didn't push the issue as hard as we could have.                        </div>

                            Mo, that's it exactly!  Also, as a dog, I'm *expected to uphold those same tenets that my character presumably became a dog to escape*.  Really, why would a woman become a dog (for religious reasons, to show devoutness) if a woman's proper role in society is to get married, have kids, and keep a household?  So she is deliberately choosing to step outside the bounds of normal society, only to enforce those bounds.  It seems hypocritical or something.<br/>
<br/>
The game I played was also a one-shot, so the character had no chance to develop, but I didn't like playing her at all.  She seemed flat, hypocritical, and weak because she got out of something only to enforce it.  There is no great story in that, there's no revenge, there's no struggle.  I personally had a struggle playing a character enforcing such conservative values.  I may try again just to see if I *can* play something so contrary to my own nature, but the first time wasn't so fun.<br/>

<p>Brand,</p>
<p>Setting = color means that the setting "issues" are non-issues. Women are second-class citizens, but the women PCs are automatically exempt from that fate - usually without any in-game reason or process. This is done for the sake of appeasing pc-ness, to create some kind of gaming "fairness", or just because we believe our 2000AD standards to be universal. At best the games might feature the PCs as outsiders (as most games of D&amp;D do) and the native community as, well, natives with their peculiar mysogynic customs. The native social structure is only used as backdrop, and the PCs are usually untouched by it. It falls for me in the same category as "weapons prohibited to wizards" list. (Similarly there are slaves, but nobody is a slave-owner, or the treatment of slaves is never discussed, or if someone is sold into slavery they never seem to experience anything worse than a night in custody before their buddies barge in to save them.)</p>
<p>Such a setting either ignores those issues on the thematic level as above, or altogether. Fantasyland can be virtually the liberal utopia of our time. And nobody seems to care, because they didn't come to tackle the setting on this level at all. They came to have ADVENTURES!</p>
<p>As for your question - oh yes. The setting is not engaging on its own, and it hampers the ability to create a believable character in that setting, which sucks. If you want to just immerse in the experience of living in an extremely non-egalitarian setting (not for the sake of changing its ways) I won't stop you. But who would, and for what purpose? And if you create a character who is rebelling against the setting, isn't this kind of a non-choice? And so, the female PC is already conveniently cast <em>a priori</em> as a "successful rebel". Because the game is implicitly not about letting the PCs muck around with gender roles and the ways of ye olde society. (Fantasyland is even worse in this regard, since it's just our world, dressed up for no good reason.) Only if setting =/= color can gender become a valid issue. Like in Claire's <em>Dogs</em> scene, it can matter and it can be engaging. It can be an engine to create tension, not a brush to paint some scenery with.</p>
<p>Actually, I did a bit of misrepresentation in the last paragraph. In a way, I myself willingly roleplayed a woman in such a setting, just so I could experience what it is like to be treated by men in a certain way. It was very very illuminating, but I don't see a woman doing this for fun, not when they can see those things up close and personal every day.</p>

                            On the sexual abuse level, I once played a character who used to be a prostitute because she had no other way to earn money and then turned to thievery.  I played her with no emotions that attached her to other people: no love, no hate, no remorse, no friendship.  She shut everyone out.  She would work with you, save your life, even, but she didn't care about anyone else, not even family.  She was even sleeping with one of the other characters because there was no reason not to and it helped to have someone to watch her back, even if she didn't trust him.  She was really really awesome to play and one of my all-time favourite characters.<br/>

                            Oh, here's an interesting data point, and shock of shocks it happens to be right on topic...<br/><br/>Brand's mention of his abused character made me think of this, and I figure it might be useful to share...<br/><br/>One of the reasons I choose female characters is that it lets me deal more directly with an issue that really gets under my skin: rape.  I have played at least one rape victim and I actually have been evaluating play groups for years now looking for one I would feel comfortable doing it with again.  I think my hesitance to do this with just anyone stems, at least in part, from my perception that I'll be negatively judged for wanting to explore this issue so directly because, let's face it, I'm a guy, what business do I have exploring the victimization of rape victims?<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

In other words, to move from someone who is totally bought-in, to someone who is conflicted and confused, and to see where that might take the character.<br/><br/>If only there were a way to play Dogs online with you and Mo . . . .                        </div>

                            Woah, Jess, big topic....<br/><br/><code>Everyone: how do you find that creating characters with dysfunctional sexual natures or histories of sexual abuse relates to the sex/gender of the characters you create? How does it come up in play? Do you only see abused characters in play, or do people ever play sexual abusers? And how do you deal with the out-of-game issues that it might raise for players with histories of sexual abuse of their own?</code><br/><br/>I've played characters who were abused in their history, and in the present fiction of their lives. I've played women who were abused but were not disempowered. I've played women in relationships that were mutually abusive, so I guess that I have played abusers as well. In the game that Brand is referring to about here:<br/><br/><code>My other "female" PC at this point is actually a gender-switcher that is tied to another character. Due to a magical geas the character has to assume the sex opposite that of hir master, so she's a girl when the master is a boy and a boy when the master is a girl. In both forms the character is highly sexualized and built to be both the boy and girl that you would want to fuck but wouldn't because you knew it was bad trouble. So the girl is certainly that tempting bit again, but the boy is tooÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ and the whole thing is complicated by the fact that the character is basically the bound mount and companion of another character.</code><br/><br/>the other character is mine. We haven't started playing the game yet. The character he describes is his secondary character (each of the three PC's will be pursuing mostly separate stories, but each of the players has a PC in the other's story) and was built to be this way mostly at my request. The character is a departure for me in a number of big ways, and the fact that s/he is both the abuser and the owner of power is one of them. The other ways are: the character is deeply problematic, is a protagonist without being a hero and my approach consists of a very deply defined direction for the kind of story I want to tell. I'm heavily authoring concept and theme, but not outcome. I am aggressively frontloading the framing of the story, while still allowing the story to tell itself.<br/><br/>The character is essentially a failed bodhisattva, a posthuman being that has recognized and long since accepted the meaninglessness and non-existance of the world but who is immortal and as such is incapable of escaping the flesh to finalize the transition to nirvana... sort of. The relationship between hir and Brand's character is a critical component in illustrating the deeply problemic nature of hir soul, and will likely be part of the escalation. So I've essentially created a character that is an abuser, but whose abuse is intentionally installed as a story element. I think I would have more trouble playing a PC abuser without   a point and a plan.<br/><br/>I've played lots of sexual dysfunction, too, many of which contain dynamics of power and control. This happens for a number of reasons. When I called myself the Mistress of the Tragic Flaw in the Epicaric Virago post, I meant it. The psychology of a character is intrinsic to my personal "T" enjoyment and reflection out of game, and the emotional evolution of a character is intrinsic to my very  "F" player character socket, so when the two are combined, the evolution of character psychology and emotional wellbeing through trauma and hard dramatic stakes are common playgrounds of my characters, even the lighter ones. Plus, even when I'm not engaging in power play sexuality in games for the sake of trauma and emotional evolution it still comes up because I find the dynamic... interesting. <br/><br/>In games, I only ever engage in play that I think my fellow players can emotionally handle, allow Nobody Gets Hurt lines when there are identified issues, and hold a IWNAY policy where stuff comes out in play that trigger emotional response. I'm not afraid of emotionality even terrible, hard emotionality (though am sheepish of my own outside of a game context, isn't that funny?) and I've proven to most of the people I play with that if it gets emotionally turbulent in a bad way, that their boundries and their emotional reaction will be respected and they will be supported with every ounce of my energy.                        </div>

I definitely want men taking the issue seriously and working it through, because men also have to live with the consequences of rape, even if they're not the direct victim.  Plus something like 10% of rape victims are men in any case.                        </div>

                            Now I understand why people spend so much time on forums. When you can find fun and actual engagement in them, they're like crack. I post, and whoops! There's a half a dozen more insightful, interesting stuff to respond to!<br/><br/><b>Pease Jess,</b><br/><br/>Rock on! Sounds exactly like the kind of dynamic that I might have come up with myself, in another game at another time.<br/><br/><b> Not-Pease Jess</b>,<br/><br/>Rock on! sounds very much like the kind of character that I was considering making at one point. I don't own the illo, so if you want to see it, whisper me your email addy and I'll mail it along. Don't want to post against copyright.<br/><br/><b>Nancy,</b><br/><br/>Neato!, I have to say that it's very cool to have so many other girls with hard dramatic interests to compare notes with. I joined a Girls with Dice community in LJ and found it terrible and stifling.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the boys aren't great in this thread too, it's just that I'm used to having a lot boy voices around, so it's been nice to have more of a mix.<br/><br/>Speaking of which....<br/><br/><b> Thomas</b>,<br/><br/>Very brave, and very interesting. What business do you have exploring the victimization of rape victims? Lots of business if you're doing it sensitively and with learning exploration in mind (besides which, I firmly believe that rape is not something that only happens to women).<br/><br/>It calls for the question though: What have you learned/ taken away from the experience?<br/><br/><b>Brand,</b><br/><br/>I've wanted to be and wanted to do my own character, independantly, alternately and simultaneously. I suppose that this is unsurprising considering all the revelations I've made in this thread. I should probably shut up soon before I start to get a dirty RPG rep.<br/><br/>I will also note that I think I only ever once made a character (<a href="http://spaceanddeath.com/geekgrrl/Ravi.pdf" rel="nofollow"> See Ravi</a>) that I *got a crush* on. I'm using that terminology specifically, in the kind of swoony, bubbly, romantic teenage girl kind of way.                        </div>

I guess this is still on topic since it's about whether or not I'm getting positive milage out of playing cross-gender, but I'm sure Brand will come down like a ton of bricks if it's not...<br/><br/>Anyway, to actually answer your question...  What have I learned?  That's a tough one...<br/><br/>I guess if I'm completely honest I have to say I don't feel I've learned much, but it's hard to say really.  One of the reasons I want to explore the issue is that I already have an incredibly strong stance and set of thoughts regarding it.<br/><br/>Since I haven't played with it much, it's difficult for me to identify where my established ideas end and the lessons learned in play pick up.  That's one of the big reasons I'd be interested in doing it again sometime: experience tells me that I would learn more by exploring more.  Well, I'm young, there's time...<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            You know, I'm starting to get the feeling I'm not needed here anymore.... <br/><br/>Oh, and I've run Dogs online before -- with Joshua BishopRoby and others (I don't think any of the others post here). If you wanted to something could probably be arranged.<br/><br/>Other than that: <br/><br/>Nancy, that's an interesting dynamic. How do you balance the "I will fight and work with you" with the "I don't care about you?" I mean, was it that she said she didn't care but her actions showed otherwise, or did you use methods to show that she really didn't care and was just there for her own reasons or what? Or short form: more detail please! <br/><br/>Thomas: Girls beat me to it. For me in my thing with the abused girl cum femme fatal, it made me realize how often my fantasies of sexy womenz were... well, objective and voiceless. There was a whole part of my life in which I never, in my dirty back brain, stopped to wonder why the sexy video girl was hitting on me so hard... so realizing that the pattern of behavior I was fantasizing about was consistant with abuse victims was like getting punched in the nuts. <br/><br/>As a note, no, I don't think all women who are active, agressive, or whatever in their sexuality are unhealthy or abused. I'm saying that the issue was that before that revelation I -hadn't cared enough what they were other than sexy-. Now I still like the sexy womenz, but I want to know them, not just see them. <br/><br/>(Of course, that's also due to things like growing up and getting married, not just due to the game. But the game did a good job of shoving it up my nose until I had to realize that I had changed and accept that in myself.) <br/><br/>MarK, <br/><br/>What about the female who rebels against the world and loses? Or loses part way? Or wins only after a lot of pain and sacrifice? Can that get around the "you will win a priori" issue?                        </div>

                            So I dig that some people have issues with Dogs, but I guess I view the role of the PCs a little differently.  For example, in the first game of Dogs I ran on IRC with Ben and Claire and some other cool kids, the PCs ended up declaring one of the Mountain People to be in charge of the town.  That's INSANE if you see the Dogs' duty to be upholding the social order outlined in the book.  But I don't think Vincent intends that to be what Dogs do at all.  The Dogs just try to fix things as best they can, in the manner in which they see fit.  Which regularly means ruling against the social order that empowers them.<br/>
<br/>
I definitely grok Mo's point that playing female Dogs, because of the setting, means that gender is always going to be a major issue.  It's just like how, when women are regular participants on a roleplaying forum, gender will eventually become a major topic for discussion (and I'm SO glad this is working out here), because of the massive gender imbalance.<br/>
<br/>
Rolling back up to Brand's questions.  I think exploring male sexuality in roleplaying is something I'd like to do more of, but I'd need a good group of kids to do it with and I'm not sure I can find a crowd nearby who'd be both 1) interested, and 2) supportive.  I might be able to do it in Mike Holmes' HeroQuest IRC game, but I'm playing a pregnant ice troll, so that's not really possible there :)<br/>
<br/>
To answer your questions specifically...<br/>
<br/>
I think I'd like to address male sexuality and what-it-means-to-be-a-man both 1) with female players involved and 2) just with other guys.  I think starting with a flirty rapscallion swashbuckler-type character would be a good first step, to just do fun male sexuality that is cute and ridiculous, and so not especially threatening.  And, from there, I might model characters after friends and acquaintances who tend to be more sexually overbearing than myself, to see how those interactions play out.  I don't know what to say about "issues I really want to nail."  I guess I'd like to play a male character who was sexually aggressive without being morally repugnant.  I have several other glimmers of ideas, but nothing that I can really articulate.<br/>
<br/>
I've played in a few games in which I was the only male involved, but I was always GMing there and didn't talk with the other players to see if they wanted to take advantage of that rare opportunity to do something interesting and valuable.  Instead, it was one of those, "empower women by not making a big deal about them being women" things.  Like the Powerpuff Girls.  And doing something else may not have worked for that group.  If the opportunity came up again, I'd love to do it, but I'd rather be a fellow player and not the GM.                        </div>

It's a sad, hard issue in marginalized culture, and all too common that within deeply oppressed groups, single members of the group will fall out and give over to the oppressor in an effort to curry favour or save themselves. There's lots of story in that, terrible struggle, some revenge. The problem is that it's not something all people can play, most often we like to like the characters we play, not just understand why they came to be.<br/><br/>It makes me want to try some day though.                        </div>

It's a good question -- but I would generalize it more.  i.e. How do you relate sexually to the characters you play?  How does it vary with whether they are your gender or the opposite?  <br/><br/>Several of my female characters have been sexy in a super-femmy way: Idelle, Morgause, and Gudrid.  I'm not sure if this is the woman I want to be or the woman I want to have a fling with, but I suspect more the former.  They're all mothery, femmy types.  Idelle was the extreme of passive aggressive, while Gudrid was a more positive sort, while Morgause was the manipulative type.  I tend not to play butch women, I think following logic that for butch characters I might as well play a man which is easier -- which I can logically see is a fallacy but I think it's what I have done.  Dot isn't very far towards either butch or femmy, but she's also very sexy in an unrepressed geek girl way -- at least, sexier to me than the femmy characters I mentioned.  <br/><br/>My male characters are just as sexually active, but usually not as attractive to me since I'm mostly straight.  I think Baraud was the most borderline case between man I want to be and man I'd want to be with -- the strong bad boy with S&amp;M tendencies.  At least, I had a strong picture of him and his preferences, and little of the woman whom he was flirting with.  Most of my characters tend to be over-the-top fantasized in some direction, though.  Golden Boy was the archetype of square-jawed superhero, in a sexy way.                        </div>

                            Brand asks:<blockquote>That's an interesting observation. It's one I've thought about too. Much as I'm now talking about some cross gender play that has changed me, I have to say there are equal (greater?) amounts that haven't.<br/><br/>What do you think the difference is? Is it a timing issue? A matter of the things you face in game? How strong of a pre-judgement you go into the game with?</blockquote>
That's a tough one, and it goes way beyond cross-gender play.  I mean, some of my play with male characters has really changed me, and some has not, and if I'm not mistaken it's been in roughly the same proportion.  I'd guess that X% of all my play changes me significantly, and I'm not sure that there's a weight to cross-gender or not.<br/><br/>As to actually answering your question about what the difference is...  The short answer is to exclaim, "Uh... look, a distraction!" while pointing emphatically over your shoulder.  The long answer is "Uh...  I don't actually know off the top of my head, maybe that should be a new thread?"<br/><br/>Thomas                        </div>

                            Thomas, <br/><br/>Probably. What should we call it? "How does RP change you?" Or "When does RP change you and when not?" See, I suck at titles! <br/><br/>John, <br/><br/>Now that you mention it I do have a current male character who gets pretty close to being the cross-over between "be" and "be with." He's a yogic martial artist and dancer, the good and strong man who speaks softly and has a sort of couched masculenity that shows resilience without domination. The fact that he's Indian makes me wonder if I'm not guilty of Orientiaism, and makes me wonder how much Imperialist running dog I have in me. I don't think it's "have sex" sexual but there is a sexuality to it in a deep and manly bonded friendship way. And how much of that is body based and sexual is always a murky issue.<br/><br/>Edit note: In the interests of full disclosure, I edited that last paragraph like 15 times to try to make it "right" before I stopped myself and just left it there. I still don't know if I'm expressing what I'm feeling correctly, but fuck... it's whats there.                        </div>

                            Oh, and regarding male sexuality: <br/><br/>I'm running my Conan RPG event, <a href="http://www.darkshire.net/~jhkim/rpg/brawnythews/" rel="nofollow"><b>"Brawny Thews"</b></a> at the Indie Games Explosion at GenCon this year.  Here's the Forge <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=10829" rel="nofollow"><b>pre-game thread</b></a>.  There's also a <a href="http://www.indie-rpgs.com/viewtopic.php?t=11633" rel="nofollow"><b>post-game thread</b></a>, but beware spoilers in the latter if you care about such things.  I found it to be a blast when I ran it last time, and hopefully it will be better with what I've learned.  <br/><br/>As a side note, in my first run the two women players were much more comfortable with the male sexuality than the men were.  This is perhaps unsurprising in retrospect, but it wasn't obvious to me at the time.  I had sort of expected the players to be all male.                        </div>

                            Hey Brand:
<blockquote>Jonathan, Matt -- what are some issues of masculenity that you really want to be able to nail in a game that you have been able to? That you haven't been able to? Is it easier to do it in a game with or without women? Or with only women?</blockquote>
First, sorry for the late response, Brand. I can't surf at work, which is like being in a sensory deprivation chamber for four hours.<br/><br/>So exploring masculinity. I think the real issue is being able to be vulnerable and then being able to express that vulnerability.  Really that makes for a whole lotta options. I want a character that's a man who can be afraid without it being a character flaw, or who can be sad without having to express it with a stiff upper lip. Then again, I want to be that guy in real life, too.<br/><br/>I think definitely it'd be easier to do that stuff in a mixed group, which is itself a symptom of the problem. First, women get men better than men get men or women, for some of the reasons I talk about in <a href="http://rpgtalk.net/msw/weblog/148.html" rel="nofollow">part 1 of my manifesto</a>. Second, I think that men, at least hetero men (gay men have totally different issues, I think), will express vulnerability in private to women that they're in intimate relationships with, but not so much with other guys. We gotta figure out how to just do it and be okay with it.                        </div>

                            Brand, I totally want to go to Toronto this summer.  I was hoping to visit UofT and see if it's worthwhile paying Canadian tuition to be able to study in some place that isn't as batshit as the US.  I think the answer is "probably not" but it'd give me an excuse to hang with you and Mo.  I'll cook you dinner!<br/><br/>Yes, I'm totally into playing a game involving male sexuality at GenCon.  I'll hopefully have a version of <i>Vesperteen</i> done then, and that would be a good game to do it with, since VT's gonna be like "Truth or Dare" meets <i>Buffy</i> on HBO.  But it might be better to do it with a system we all sorta know and sorta ignore, if we want to focus on content and not system.<br/><br/>Let me think about the "playing with guys vs. playing with girls" question, since that's not especially on topic.  I'll get back to you when I have something substantial to say.                        </div>

<blockquote>Anyway, since you've said you'd like a mixed group: How mixed? Would you want a male or female GM? No GM? Any specific techniques, methods, etc -- or should we wait for part 2 of the manifesto?</blockquote>
I'm not sure that's where the answer is, really. I mean, it should totally be okay for there to be groups that are all guys, and games that are more appealing to men, and so on. We just have to identify them as such, rather than as what's 'normal.' <br/><br/>In fact, I think it'd be a little creepy to be like, "dude, we need some women in this group," as opposed to "dude, I totally will do what's necessary to make women feel welcome."  Cultural training will result in women and men being more attuned to certain kinds of things, but it should be a matter of 'not my thing' rather than 'I feel excluded.'                        </div>

                            Matt, <br/><br/>What an excellent answer. The question I'd ask is how you make sure that it is an issue of "not for me" rather than "what's normal." I mean, how do you convey that to anyone other than your private group? Fuck, how do you convey that to your private group? <br/><br/>However, I think I must have asked the wrong question. Let me try to start over. Let us say that you and I and Jonathan are going to do a game in which we explore issues of masculenity and being a man in a way that gets at issues of men being distanced from their emotions. We want a fourth to join the game, and to GM for us. Does the gender of the GM mater to you at that point? Not because of "what is normal" or "what we should do as enlightened men who want to welcome women into our hobby" but because of "what will make you most able to get the issues you want."<br/><br/>See, for myself, I'm not sure. If it was Mo, I'd probably want her in the game. But there are other women in the group I game with whom I would not want in the game. Not because they are women, but because of the nature of our relationships. OTOH, I wouldn't want the VAST majority of guys I know in the game either. <br/><br/>So I wouldn't want some women, but I wouldn't want LOTS of men. Which means that there is, somewhere in my lizard brain, something that is saying, "I'd rather do it with a female GM than with a male GM who has a different/opposed idea of what being a man means, but I'd probably most want to do it with a man whom is on the same vibe I am." <br/><br/>Not because it's normal, or because its essential, but because... well, for some of the same reasons that the womenz are wanting to do Bitchez in the Vineyard. <br/><br/>Ladies, any thoughts about hearing me say that? Any insight for me into things I may be missing?                        </div>

                            Huh.<br/><br/>I wouldn't want to GM that game, because I don't feel that I know enough about you, personally, to help you explore those issues - and I can't draw on my general knowledge of issues regarding masculinity, because it's not a problem I've spent as much time thinking about as I have on issues of femininity.  I would, however, really like to be a fly on the wall.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>So I totally understand why you would want a sympathetic male GM over a female GM, although I'm sure that there are plenty of GMs of both sexes who could do a good job.<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            Brand,<br/><br/>I'm the easy answer. When it comes to you I am 100% confident that you will run any issue better than any GM I'll ever have. Regardless of the gender issue of the game. <br/><br/>It occurs to me though: I've never ever ever had a female GM, so what's normal for me isn't a concept of what is normal. HEY! Maybe you would completely SUCK compared to a female GM!                        </div>

                            Ooh, funny story moment!  I was running Sorcerer and one of the female NPC's was just getting into a relationship with one of the PC's and they were both early-20's in age.  He left her at a big Beltane celebration (it was set in Edinburgh) to go off with the party and beat up the Bad Guy.  This was after saying "I'm just going to talk with the guys for a moment."  She later called and was, like, "Where are you?" and he said "I'll be back in just a bit."  And he didn't go back.  So I pulled out the big guns.  The next time they met, she did the whole "cold shoulder" routine where he had to make it up to her, but she wasn't going to tell him a) what he did that pissed her off, specifically or b) how to make up for it.  So there was this very awkward scene involving the two of them where she was giving monosyllabic answers and he was frantically trying to figure it all out and find the best way to make it up (he eventually took her out to dinner on an official date).<br/>
<br/>
The interesting part of this story is that all three players were male and so I watched all of them go "oh shit!  panic!" and watched the player of the PC involved go "oh fuck, now what the hell do I do?!" and the other two go "oh my god, I'm so glad that's not me!"  It was really really really funny from my perspective, watching the expressions on all their faces.  :)<br/>
<br/>
I think this makes a deeper point, but I'm having trouble articulating it.  :P                        </div>

I trust that Brand would make my character suffer and succeed in interesting and unusual ways, and that's all I really need from my GM - I'm happy to do the rest.<br/><br/>Also, Brand is boy-me and I know that I would do a good job at this sort of thing.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>--Jess<br/><br/>PS Which brings me to the logical conclusion that I probably <i>could</i> run a "The Masculine Mystique" game for Brand et. al. at GenCon . . . but I'd still rather be a fly on the wall.                        </div>

                            An interesting thought has come up while thinking about BitV because I'm really psyched about it.  I'm psyched because it'll be a group of women, no men.  I think that was part of what bothered me about the game, how the male Dogs just automatically have more authority, more power than the female ones, again because they're male in a society where men carry the authority.  Now, as a Dog, my female PC does have more authority, but will always have to take back burner to the male Dog in any situation involving the two of them and someone in the society.  Unless she wants to turn it into a conflict, which may be worthwhile, but which really frustrates me.  It frustrates me for a number of reasons:<br/>
<br/>
1)  I'm a modern woman, moving in crowds where I don't have to fight tooth and nail against discrimination.<br/>
2)  I didn't build in the handicap.  If I wanted to explore this issue, I would make a character that would address it, but I have no choice in this case.<br/>
<br/>
I think these are the two big ones.  So I'm anticipating BitV because there will be a power balance when NPC's deal with us, rather than the inherent imbalance in a mixed-sex group of dogs when dealing with NPC's.  I'm looking specifically at how townspeople will react to the PC's, not how the dogs interact with each other.<br/>

                            Brand,<br/><br/>The most amusing overtone to Nancy's little story (from my point of view) is that the player in question was me, her boyfriend of nearly 1.5 years, and our relationship has been basically devoid of those sorts of little games (thank God...). My character was a bit more clueless than I like to think I am, even aside from being preoccupied at the time with his demonic guitar and the recent murder of his parents. I can't authoritatively speak for the other players, but a decent amount of my visceral "Oh shit, what do I do now?" feeling was directly tied in with my relief that Nancy doesn't put me through that sort of thing in real life.                        </div>

<p>Sure, but this presupposes that the one can engage in such issues in the setting. You see, a woman can rebel and <em>lose</em> a priori just "because that's how things are in this world" and this sucks big time for me. Any other reason for any result of her rebellion is cool, and can make a great story if the group is into it and is willing to shake the setting up.</p>

<blockquote>Let us say that you and I and Jonathan are going to do a game in which we explore issues of masculenity and being a man in a way that gets at issues of men being distanced from their emotions. We want a fourth to join the game, and to GM for us. Does the gender of the GM mater to you at that point? Not because of "what is normal" or "what we should do as enlightened men who want to welcome women into our hobby" but because of "what will make you most able to get the issues you want."</blockquote>
Hrm. Well, so in terms of what I was saying before, I think that a) I'd be way more comfortable if the GM were a woman because despite my desire to fight it, I still have the baggage that says women are more into that stuff, and b) I think that the reality is that women understand men better than men do because they're often treated as outsiders. It's kind of  like a Marxist critique of capitalism.<br/><br/>Make sense?<br/><br/>Also, I love how much play this thread is getting, and so awesomely civil.

I especially love that you can make analogies to the Marxist critique of capitalism . . . and that it totally makes sense, in context.  There's actually some research (I think it's cited in Virginia Valian's book on women in science?) about how men and women relate that suggests you might be right about women understanding men, on average, better than vice versa.  If I weren't leaving town in two hours I'd look it up, but IIRC it was a study about women listening to men more closely than men listening to women, and how that's modified by the overt power relationship between the individuals involved.<br/><br/>I think that may be where Brand's sense of "the right male GM &gt; a fairly large group of female GMs &gt; everyone else" comes from.<br/><br/>Also: this place rocks, which, I suppose, is why I'm posting here when I'm supposed to be leaving town in two hours.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>

                            Quick question for Nancy and other women who'd had Dogs-related issues in the past (I totally want to read the game logs for <i>BitV</i>, btw, assuming you'll make them available):<br/><br/>I'd personally love to play, say, the only male Dog in a group of three, where the other two Dogs were female, and then clearly have my Dog NOT be the leader of the group, but play a supporting role.  How would that kind of game work for you?<br/><br/>Also, can you imagine a version of <i>BitV</i> where some of the players were male, but the characters were all female?  Would that be less comfortable?  Would you be less excited about such a game?<br/><br/>Word to the awesomeness. No offense to Story Games meant, but I don't know if it's the place rocking so much as the people involved in this particular thread, who seem to all be on the same page.  I already told Brand and Mo that I want to join them on a game design commune somewhere, and the rest of y'all should come too.  Can't wait for GenCon, when I get to play with you guys in person.<br/><br/>BTW, have you guys seen Paul Czege's Feminist Game Design Manifesto on RPGtalk?  It's pretty crazy cool interesting, but that's probably another thread...                        </div>

                            My main Dogs-related issue has been lack of opportunity to play - so, yes, I think all of your suggestions are interesting.  I would love to play with a non-dominant male character, and watch him flail to hand off authority, and see how he would handle other people's expectations of him.  I'd love to play in a game (hell, any game, not just Dogs) with all female characters but a variety of players.  In fact, I think I'm going to try precisely that in the next game that I run.  My group generally runs 20-50% female characters, with 0-50% female players depending on the game, but I've only had one game with a majority of female characters and I'd really like to work with that again.<br/><br/><i>BitV</i> isn't going to be any of those things, of course, but that's why we play these games over and over and over - to try different stuff.  <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>Can you post a link to the Feminist Game Design manifesto somewhere?<br/><br/>--Jess                        </div>

                            So many posts to keep up with....<br/><br/>Albert, <br/><br/>That makes things much clearer! I have a lot of questions for you, but I don't think they go in this thread -- they're about playing with SOs more than they are about playing with gender. So yea, I'll start a new thread when I get back from my trip, and ping you over there. <br/><br/>MarK, <br/><br/>Dogs are chosen by the Steward of the branch. That is to say, a man in a position of priesthood authority choses from among the youth of a town which are suited to being a Dog. They are then interviewed, and if they accept the call they go off to be trained. <br/><br/>Of course, you start the game as a Dog, so someone somewhere has already found you worthy. Which makes an interesting case for the a priori suitability issue. <br/><br/>Matt, <br/><br/>Makes perfect sense. But then I'm a big social constructivist, so Marxist analogies always make sense to me. And yea, Jess is right, that is where my "the right male GM &gt; a fairly large group of female GMs &gt; everyone else" issue comes from. Because the person who best knows the faults of a system isn't the observant outsider, but the rebelious insider. <br/><br/>Matt and Jonathan, <br/><br/>Story Games rocks. The folks on this thread rock. Both are true statements. We are vast, we contain multitudes. <br/><br/>Thomas, <br/><br/>I haven't seen Paul's either, but Matts rocks the house in a real way. <br/><br/>Everyone, <br/><br/>Today is my last day about this thread for at least a week -- I'm off to Chicago. So if'n you've questions specific for me, ask em while you can.                        </div>

                            Damn, I could have sworn I saw Paul's name next to that when I was reading it last night.  Must have been a strained brain nerve from teaching too much Chinese.  <b>Apologies, Matt!  You are teh awesome!</b>  I've been thinking about a big response all day, but it'll have to wait until I get off work.  I think part of why I push toward developing more diverse styles of play is to try to have games that strike different nerves with different people, and therefore (hopefully) increase the overall diversity of roleplaying and the people who feel a part of it.  But that's another thread...<br/><br/><b>Jess II:</b> Thanks for the response, that helps.  And I wasn't trying to invade your <i>BitV</i> game, obviously <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/>  I was just wondering if you ladies had a strong preference for the all-female players thing or if that's just what you were interested in doing right now.                        </div>

                            Jonathan,<br/><br/>In general, I think many female Dogs with one male Dog would be a neato game to play. In specific, I'm excited particularly about BitV because I've had trouble approach it and because it's all girls. I don't suspect that it will take long to find my empowerment after a couple of sessions of that game, so I'd like to do it, but *after* the BitV game for all the reasons I posted about my problems with Dogs earlier.<br/><br/>As for the other: the mixed gender game with an all female Dogs group I would feel different about, and that different = more cautious. Once again, *after* the BitV experiment I'd be comfortable playing it if the other players were, say, You or Brand or Matt, as I have a strong prepared confidence that it would be interesting, and that you might have something to say that was approachable and potentially valuable to me as a woman.<br/><br/>So, different, not bad, but not "Let's do it!" - just yet.                        </div>

                            Mo, I must say I agree.  The idea of playing an all-female game got me really psyched, and throwing a male into the mix really shakes things up, even a male playing a female character.<br/>
<br/>
I think in part this is because there is just a set of experiences and ways of looking at the world that are common to all women and putting a man in changes the dynamic.  For the men, imagine you and a group of other men hanging out and talking.  Now put in a woman and the whole thing changes, right?  Same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that after this game, I'll be willing to experiment with your idea, Jonathan, but I need to settle down in a "safer" environment first.<br/>

                            When I was in college, I hung out with the lesbians over in Fairfield Hall a lot.  We had a lot of interests in common, and they were the only women on campus who wouldn't flinch when I came within ten meters.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure exactly why that is, but... well, it's immaterial to what I'm getting at...<br/>
<br/>
At one point, several months after I had been hanging out with them, one of them turned to me and said, "You're great, Fred.  You're like this six-foot-eight dyke, except you've got a dick."                        </div>

I see. Yeah, at a glance this looks like the a priori case. But Dogs from what I hear is all about customizing, challenging and generally chewing large parts of the setting, so I don't think it's quite the same. <br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to a nagging question. <br/>
<br/>
Would anyone (here, or at all) design a strictly gender-exclusive game? Why? If no, why not? Would the answer be different if it's an all-female or an all-male game? <br/>

                            Well, I'm fine with single character gender games.  Other examples include <i>Macho Women With Guns</i> and <i>Trollbabe</i>.  Note that if it's character gender, there are a lot more choices than all-male or all-female.  There are a couple of robot PC games, to pick a simple example.  <br/><br/>I had been pondering about doing a "Left Hand of Darkness" game at one point.  I've also run several single-gender short campaigns and one-shots, like my Conan game where all the PCs are male Cimmerian barbarians.                        </div>

<p>I'm in conflict about that! It's possible, but I haven't seen it in play to know what it means -- the system constrains a female samurai to interact with others in a masculine role, and all. I suspect it's either a really striking difference, or a matter of using a different pronoun.</p>
<p>Old-SFK (I did this for like IGC '04 or something) was less flexible and didn't permit female samurai at all.</p>

<p>Yes, those are good examples. (I believe <em>The Mountain Witch</em> would also qualify, even though I am not sure it specifically states the PCs are male. Still, they're ronin. If I presume wrong, scrap this.)</p>
<p>But may I ask - was <em>Snow from Korea</em> intentionally all-male, or was it a by-product of its historical and social setting (PC are samurai warriors, and samurai warriors are historically male --&gt; all PC are male)?</p>

                            There's also Emily's <i>Breaking the Ice</i> (which can be played male/female, male/male, or female/female, but the characters' gender is important) and then my fixed-character games <i>KKKKK</i> and <i>Waiting/Tea</i> (which I seem to be pimping all over the place today), which both require one female and one male character (though the characters are pre-made, in a non-traditional sense).

<p>MarK,</p>
<p>I'd like to pretend that there was some causal order to it, but it really just jumped into my head fully-formed. You can get the same effect in any situation where you can guarantee that each character is a member of a couple where the other member is immobilised. The split gender role thing just accomplishes this really efficiently.</p>

<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>I guess was trying to make a connection between games designed specifically to deal with gender-related issues, and games with attention to PC gender.</p>
<p>1) T+T = Games that were designed to deal with gender-related issues, and the PC gender is a part of that design. <em>Vampires</em> comes to mind. John's Conan game I think too. (Maybe even the proposed "Left Hand of Darkness"?)</p>
<p>2) F+F = Just the opposite. The play is free-for-all, and any gender dynamic or theme or group complexion is incidental to the game. Most gaming goes here, whether indie or mainstream.</p>
<p>3)  F+T = PC gender can be important, but only aesthetically. If gender is implied, "drifting" the gender does not result in a fundamentally different play experience. <em>TMW</em> with female PCs, <em>SfK</em> perhaps? Others like <em>Trollbabe</em> might be as well, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>4) T+F = The issue of game has to do with gender, but the PC gender is not pre-set, or is irrelevant. I can't at this stage see a game that does this. Perhaps a game that is "about" gender issues, that provides a different play experience if the PC genders are different? Or will such a game flail about and crash? Does addressing gender issues in a game best done with PC gender constraints than without them?</p>
<p>I'm not trying to pigeonhole or restrict here, just to see if this helps me (or anyone else, for that matter) make sense of some stuff. Stop me if you think I'm barking up the wrong tree.</p>
<p>Jonathan,</p>
<p>How is <em>KKKKK</em> about female-male interactions? At first I tended to place it under F+T above, but in the light of what you said, I'm not sure.</p>

                            Mark, <i>KKKKK</i> might be more T+K, I'm not sure, since I don't totally understand your categories yet.  The game is basically just a "dialogue of victory" (instead of the old "monologue of victory") in which Kyoko tells how she has thoroughly bested Kublai.  So it's sort of about how a man can keep his dignity and self-esteem when he has been completely overpowered and screwed (or, in this case, stabbed) by a woman.  I really hope this didn't come out of lingering feelings from my last major relationship, but now I'm beginning to wonder...<br/><br/>Kyoko has won.  In the end, Kublai dies, no matter what the players do.  The dialogue between them, however, determines the context and, therefore, the meaning of Kublai's death.  While the characters seem pre-determined (you always play Kyoko and Kublai), the players, over the course of play, determine who these people really are by showing us 1) what they've done and 2) how they think/feel.  In the end, it may seem that Kyoko has done a noble and badass thing by destroying the tyrant Kublai and making sweet love to his many wives.  Or, depending on how play goes, both players might end up kinda sad at the end, when the Great Khan dies, and wonder whether Kyoko really is really acting in a moral fashion.<br/><br/>However the game goes, play ends with both characters acknowledging some measure of respect for each other in the final two lines.  So really, I guess, <i>KKKKK</i> is about a relationship that went bad (all the way to stabbing), but, in the end, the two ex-lovers part after ackowledging that their counterpart is a pretty amazing person.  And they move on (dying, for Kublai, is a kind of release).<br/><br/>Does that help any, Mark?  I think the mechanical differences between Chema &amp; Gai Zheng in <i>Waiting/Tea</i> is somewhat related, but I'd have to think a bit to try to figure out what distinctions are gender-based distinctions and which are personality-based distinctions.                        </div>

<p>Mo,</p>
<p>T/F is True/False, not related to MB.</p>
<p>The first is : does the game have to do with gender? <br/>
The second is : in this game, is PC gender pre-set? (whether intentionally or coincidentally)</p>
<p>Fred,</p>
<p>I don't own <em>Breaking the Ice</em>, but it sounds so, yes. Especially if I grok Jonathan's post above correctly, and PC gender can vary, then the game can be used to play out different kinds of relationships depending on the PCs involved. (I was under the impression that player gender can vary and that in <em>BtI</em> you always play woman dating man, but like I said I don't own it so I'm probably wrong.)</p>

<p>Jonathan,</p>
<p>This would make <em>KKKKK</em> a ?+T I think.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the defining feature of the game is determining through play who these people (K and K, respectively) are, how they relate to each other and why. Now, this is not directly related to their gender, unless I got you totally wrong. So to me it looks as if the game prescribes the gender of its PCs, but whether it aims to tell a gendered story on purpose, I couldn't understand. I couldn't tell from your explanation if the game is about a man-woman relationship or male/female(/irrelevant) personality.</p>
<p>(How) would playing the game be different if the killer was male? If the khan was female? Both? Would the game be about something else then? (Maybe it would still be a gender-related issue, just a different one. In this case, T+F [edited].)</p>
<p>Am I making any sense?</p>
<p>MarK.</p>

<p>I think I got the various distinctions for this little model of mine, but the more I think about it the less I see where it can be useful.</p>
<p>At first I wanted to see whether a game about gender would necessitate setting certain gender limits on its PCs (it doesn't). Then whether it would benefit from such limits (yes, depending on the game in question). Then I mused whether a game with PC gender pre-set could influence the types of stories dealing with gender even if the design doesn't specifically lean in this direction (sure it can, but presumably to deal with those stories better it should be designed with them in mind). But as I suspected those would be the answers, dissecting it the way I did didn't teach me anything new (except that now I will be more aware of PC gender choices in game designs).</p>
<p>I hope it wasn't a total waste of time for anyone. Nevertheless Mo, I would still like to hear what you think.</p>

<p>[edited] P.S. Also, next time I will open a new thread. Sorry, Brand!</p>
