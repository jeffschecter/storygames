It's a method of getting what you want. Maybe you want someone to admit to his wrongdoings, or maybe you want him to keep his mouth shut, or maybe you just want to take his sandwich because you're hungry.<br/><br/>You could do all that without resorting to violence. It's just that violence is a shortcut. It's faster and requires less work. In RPGs, violence is often applied as a blunt instrument, but it is best when used as a scalpel.<br/><br/>Moves model intent. Why not make violence incidental to moves themselves?<br/><br/>When you resort to violence to get your way, inflict harm as established. You might also suffer harm as established if your victim puts up a fight. Then make your move and add the following choices:<br/><br/>\u2022 You roll +hard instead of anything else.<br/>\u2022 You take +1 on your roll.<br/>\u2022 You inflict terrible harm (+1 harm).<br/>\u2022 You suffer little harm (-1 harm).<br/><br/>This might not graft entirely cleanly onto the system.

Theoretically, yes, though my inclination is that violence is more sensible augmenting moves than totally replacing them. In the realm of hypotheticals, you could write a move like:\n<blockquote>When you seek more information on your current situation, roll +nothing. On a hit, the MC tells you something new and interesting, and might ask you a question or two; answer them. On a 10+, the MC gives you good detail. On a 7\u20139, the MC gives you an impression. If you already know all there is to know, the MC will tell you that. On a miss, be prepared for the worst</blockquote>\nWhen you open your brain to the world's psychic maelstrom, or you do something profoundly creepy and disturbing, roll +weird instead of anything else, then make your move and add the following choice:<br/><br/>\u2022 You close yourself off from the maelstrom before it seeps through.<br/>\u2022 You don't suffer \u03a8-harm.<br/><br/>I believe that level of mechanical alteration would transform the system fundamentally in a way that peripheral violence would not. Your mileage may vary, of course, and I'm thinking how peripheral violence would impact the game.<br/><br/>When you open your brain, a character might scatter entrails from a sacrifice. When the hocus speaks truth, he might spill his own blood, or demand an orgy of violence to whip his followers into a frenzy. When the chopper imposes his will on his gang, he might shoot one or two to make a point.<br/><br/>As I said, it doesn't fit into the system exactly, but I think the consequences might be very interesting.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_469606">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/469606/#Comment_469606" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2018-02-02T23:30:59+00:00" title="February  2, 2018 11:30PM">February 2018</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agre that it's interesting, especially if the effects aren't concrete enough.

It's based on "when a player describes their character doing <i>this</i>, you ask them to roll for <i>this</i> move".<br/><br/>If you try to sweet talk someone there's really no way for that move to end in you gunning them down.

That's exactly what we're talking about, right?<br/>And go aggro basically *is* the definition of potentially-violent interactions in AW.<br/><br/>Even if that example doesn't convince, though, there's nothing about the structure of moves and outcomes that wouldn't allow you to build it into the rules of you want to.<br/><br/>Most likely it would appear in a form of "moves snowball" design, much like how, say, the Chopper's "pack alpha" move often leads to violence even though that is not the character's original intention.<br/><br/>Something like Dogs in the Vineyard can do so much more explicitly and flexibly, but there are other trade offs to that. Just depends what your game needs.<br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
