This seems to give  <br/>continuity to the community. Many people get the majority of their  <br/>role-playing at the cons; in between, they play board games, but  <br/>rarely campaigns.<br/> <br/>The GM is important. The title can be misleading; to GM a game can  <br/>simply mean facilitating it. People often choose what games to play  <br/>based on who's the GM.<br/> <br/>People write their own scenarios - but there's apparently no interest  <br/>in publishing, although GMs are happy to send you their files on  <br/>request. The drive is to run fun games for people in the community,  <br/>not to reach out. However, we met several people who'd played many US  <br/>indie games - one girl said her first gaming experience was with PTA.<br/> <br/>We played two full games: A CoC tabletop and a multiform.<br/> <br/>The tabletop was what I'd call a solid, fun, traditional freeform.  <br/>Diceless, with pre-created characters; clear setup of central  <br/>relationships - though there wasn't much focus on developing  <br/>relationship dynamics, this being a free-rolling one-shot where we  <br/>sort of assumed the characters would die anyway. The very competent GM  <br/>portrayed NPCs, had all necessary info memorized, set up the  <br/>situation, let us get ourselves into trouble (the characters were  <br/>designed to make that quite easy), and kept events moving at a regular  <br/>pace. GM fiat and basic impro skills were the (implicit) system.<br/> <br/>The multiform was a semi-larp freeform game. We gathered around a  <br/>table, got character descriptions and looked at a map of the ship. The  <br/>genre and plot expectations were communicated clearly: there would be  <br/>a murder, and the characters were mostly stereotypes of different  <br/>nationalities. (This is typical for con one-shots, where you need to  <br/>be able to get into &amp; portray your character quickly). Again, GM fiat  <br/>and play culture were the system; we rolled dice a few times, but were  <br/>never told the mechanics - I did notice that my roll of 5 was  <br/>different from another player's roll of 5, but don't know why.<br/> <br/>The game was larplike in that me moved about, and acted out stuff -  <br/>getting on my knees to drink vodka from a lady's shoe, for example.  <br/>Many players were in costume; apparently there's also a strong  <br/>steampunk community which overlaps with the freeformers. (The  <br/>combination of rules-light games and opportunity for dressing up seems  <br/>to result in more women in the community). <br/> <br/>Often we'd want to go to different "rooms" in the "airship". Either  <br/>that meant a quick talk with the GM in the corridor, or the GM would  <br/>temporarily designate a corner of the room as kitchen, laboratory or  <br/>similar.<br/> <br/>Towards the end the GM said we had fifteen minutes left, in case there  <br/>was anything we wanted to do. I tried to push the main character off  <br/>the airship, but a die roll showed that I fell to my death instead. So  <br/>I sat watching and taking pics for a little while.<br/><br/>A general note: The games, being one-shot con games, did not focus on or promote any form of heavy immersion, complex characterization, emo porn etc. I'm not sure how that translates to the rest of the Melbourne gaming culture. There are, apparently, ongoing Vampire larps that probably cover this, but I don't know anything about it.<br/><br/>Questions are welcome!<br/><br/>EDIT: John Dalton, our capable and sociable GM in the multiform is apparently an active steampunker - <a href="http://profunclefesta.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">here's</a> his web page.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253892">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs" title="Matthijs"><img alt="Matthijs" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:nn92N-SMkGOdpM:http://www.iconarchive.com/icons/iconfactory/space/32/The-Sun-icon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Matthijs">Matthijs</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253892/#Comment_253892" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T20:34:25+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  8:34PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Oh, and if  you haven't read the <a href="http://story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=10871" rel="nofollow">thread on Australian Freeform</a>, you might want to.

One of our GMs had his daughter co-GM the game; I don't know how old she was, but probably late teens (I'm getting so old now that I have trouble guessing young people's age...) It seemed to me like the crowd there knew each other fairly well, so I guess they're regular con-goers who have been playing for years. <br/><br/>Another clue is that the con (at least on the last day) wasn't really set up for newcomers; when we got there, there was no sign on the street outside the school area; people couldn't really tell us whether a game had started or not, whether it was full or not, or who was the GM... we often had to ask around a bit to find out basic info. So it's probably a place where everyone knows what's going on.<br/><br/>("Standard larp" doesn't exist. UK larp, French larp and Scandinavian larp are very different things. Danish larp and Finnish larp cultures are not at all the same. But after that obligatory pedantic comment...) From my point of view, the multiform we participated in had these traits:<br/>- Larplike: Some people dress up. We move about and portray our roles with fitting voices, accents and physical gestures.<br/>- Un-larplike: There's no attempt at a 360 degree illusion; that is, nobody tries to hide the fact that we're in a classroom (not on an airship), the diamonds we steal are hastily sketched on pieces of paper, etc. Much of our shared fiction comes from GM descriptions and other verbal cues. We roll dice for resolution.<br/><br/>The scenarios aren't really distributed, which is a shame; however, the GMs are (so I hear) happy to send you their files if you e-mail them. That assumes, of course, that you know who they are, what games are good, and can find their e-mail address...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_253896">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/droog" title="droog"><img alt="droog" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://charnelgods.pbwiki.com/f/ClockworkOrange.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/droog">droog</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253896/#Comment_253896" name="Item_9" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T21:08:53+00:00" title="January 29, 2010  9:08PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2010 9:13PM by droog.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For what it's worth, here's <a href="http://www.therpghaven.com/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=368&amp;start=0" rel="nofollow">my impression</a> of the one I attended.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_253907">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/253907/#Comment_253907" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-29T23:36:47+00:00" title="January 29, 2010 11:36PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 29, 2010 11:46PM by komradebob.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is it wrong that every time I hear about this stuff I'm terribly jealous of the Aussies?<br/><br/>Does anyone know if folks States-side are doing these style of games?

A lot of this stuff was formulated down here in the late 80's.<br/><br/>As for dice rolling, an Aussie freeform typically has none. If conflict arises between character, the designer will often have an order of priority for who would win in specific situations, these will typically be modified by who has done something strategically within the context of play to gain an upper hand. The exact nature of this strategic advantage depends on the designer's ideas about task resolution or story flow.<br/><br/>Some common resolution methods include.\n<ul>\n<li>Giving characters a range of values for comparison if they happen to be involved in a certain type of conflict (these might be as general as "combat", "smarts" and "etiquette"...or whatever is suitable to the scenario designed). In most cases a player won't know their character's actual scores, but their detailed history will indicate a general idea of their potential. Such values are rarely numeric, and might be "Poor", "Average", "Good", "Very Good", or a rating from A to F (Where A is good and F is bad...lowest letter involved in a confluct wins)...very karma based.</li>\n<li>Simply making all characters equal</li>\n</ul>\nComplications to this are usually derived through the actions of the event. \n<ul>\n<li>If a character describes something strategic to the GM, their rating in a field goes up by a point.</li>\n<li>If a character manages to accomplish one of their goals in the scenario, a related field increases.</li>\n<li>If a character manages to get an ally or two on their side for an attack against a lesser number of opponents, the larger groyup might use the highest value and increase by 1 for every additional supporter.</li>\n</ul>\nIn most cases the initiator of the conflict describes their victory condition, the victim describes theirs, and then any onlookers offer their input to the GM. The GM decides based on everyone's input, then describes what happens. Each player's input is addressed in the description of the conflict outcome.<br/><br/>It has only been a recent phenomenon for Australian freeforms to include dice or randomising mechanisms (such as Rock Paper Scissors), notably appearing after White Wolf's Minds Eye Theater appeared.<br/><br/>A multiform is where dice tend to appear...the majority of the play is LARP-like, but occasionally a need for game mechanisms rears it's ugly head and the dice come out (or cards or other system specific resolution method.\n<blockquote>Also, can anyone speak to the effect that the one shot nature of these games has on design, gamemastering, and character play? And possibly also on returning player culture?</blockquote>\nTradiationally, well written Australian freeforms have a web of complex relations spread across all the characters. If you kill someone early in the piece, there is a good chance that you will alienate someone who is necessary to one of your goals, or one of your allies goals.<br/><br/>The first third is typically working out where allegiances lie across the game, and who you can use to further your own agenda (typically, a character cannot fulfil their agenda on their own and they will need someone elses help to accomplish something significant). The second third is usually a complex game of helping allies with their agendas in exchange for gaining their help, some character impairment or elimination may occur at this stage. The final third is a climax, usually occur when one of the major background stories comes to the fore...once a plot line develops a critical mass of players behind it. There may be some kind of showdown, possibly a mystic ritual, a combat, a wedding, something dramatic that a lot of players are linked to in their back stories.<br/><br/>Most characters have a stake in each potential climax (and their may be two or three potential climaxes to a scenario). If there are multiple climaxes, they may occur simultaneously and players need to make decisions for themselves as to which they involve their characters in. At this climax point, it's make or break and players make big sacrifices in the hope to change things toward their character's cause.<br/><br/>Players tend to accept the unwritten rule that other characters shouldn't be killed in the first half of the session (after all, they paid good money to participate), but once the climax is reached, all bets are off.<br/><br/>The majority of these games are one shots. Those that occur as an ongoing sequence are like movie sequels, the surviving characters from the first installment typically appear in the next...but a new batch of characters join them.<br/><br/>I hope that helps.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_254011">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon" title="David Pidgeon"><img alt="David Pidgeon" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David%20Pidgeon">David Pidgeon</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254011/#Comment_254011" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T04:29:19+00:00" title="January 31, 2010  4:29AM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>We played a Cthulhu tabletop (systemless, we'd probably call it freeform) called "Lock, stock and two smoking trolls", and something like "Jan Snoots and the diamond murders", which was a multiform.<br/><br/>We also briefly tried out Ganakagok, but had to stop after just two and a half scenes because of time and space and stuff.</blockquote>\nIt's a shame we didn't get to play a proper game of Ganakagok, with time and space and a deck of cards and all that.

Non-standard convention games have been designed as one shots in much the same way that we see people now producing many focused indie games (a focused set of rules specifically designed for telling a single type of story, with a scenario specifically designed to exploit the full potential of those rules, characters are typically (but not always) pregenerated). Table-top play using a standard rules set is something I'm sure you're familiar with.<br/><br/>Multiform is a hybrid between these options.<br/><br/>Different GMs/Designers will select different elements for their hybrid,  which brings me to this earlier comment from Matthijs:\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite><br/>The GM is important. The title can be misleading; to GM a game can simply mean facilitating it. People often choose what games to play based on who's the GM.<br/></blockquote>\nWith different GMs choosing which elements of live play to incorporate and which elements of system to retain, different games can have a very different feel. Most GMs tend to develop a following and stick to a specific formula when presenting their games. People come to them expecting a certain play experience, and they try to deliver. We have much the same thing in Sydney. If people want to be led by the nose through an adventure where their characters WILL get screwed over, they go and play one of Frank's games (some people love this, and all the angst it brings...other people call it railroading and hate it). If people want something freewheeling and wild where they can betray one another on the way to persona glory or character agenda fulfilment, then they'll come and play one of mine. Neither of us run a very rules intensive game, but we pull the rules out that help us tell the story we want. We'll use a variety of systems that people recognise, but in most cases only pay lip service to the books, and often make up new rules on the fly to cover situations that the original game was never designed for. Pulling out a rulebook in this style of play is often considered a heinous crime.<br/><br/>Some multiforms involve a lot more movement, some use a hybrid of miniatures and live action (notably a sequential series of multiforms called Raven's Nest, which ran at least twice a year over a period of over a decade in the late 80's early 90's, using miniatures and a scale city that was over two metres wide and at least 4 metres long from what I remember). It had very simple combat and skill mechanisms and a lot of deep political intrigue, with players often starting a game with three or four agendas and picking up more along the way as they interacted with the other denizens of the city.<br/><br/>"What is Multiform?" is a very difficult question to answer because every GM has their own interpretation. What we call "Story games" or "Narrativist games" might be considered multiform to some. Other might only call it multiform if it involves props and live-action aspects.<br/><br/>I'll address another point while I'm here...\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Matthijs</cite>Another clue is that the con (at least on the last day) wasn't really set up for newcomers; when we got there, there was no sign on the street outside the school area; people couldn't really tell us whether a game had started or not, whether it was full or not, or who was the GM... we often had to ask around a bit to find out basic info. So it's probably a place where everyone knows what's going on.</blockquote>\nFrom the perspective of a Sydney convention, that wouldn't be a sign of a strong gamer culture where everyone knows what's going on...it sound more like sheer laziness on the part of the convention organisers. As someone who has helped out with a few cons, lack of decent signage is usually a capital offense (you kill your chances of ever running another convention, for at least another ten years until the current generation of gamers changes).                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_254191">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/254191/#Comment_254191" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-01-31T23:55:04+00:00" title="January 31, 2010 11:55PM">January 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2010 11:55PM by komradebob.">edited January 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: vulpinoid</cite><br/>Some multiforms involve a lot more movement, some use a hybrid of miniatures and live action (notably a sequential series of multiforms called Raven's Nest, which ran at least twice a year over a period of over a decade in the late 80's early 90's, using miniatures and a scale city that was over two metres wide and at least 4 metres long from what I remember).

This stuff sounds a whole lot like what I've been pawing my way towards, but I've never heard of anyone over here doing anything at all similar.<br/><br/>If you have any links that would be helpful,  and I'd really appreciate those as well.<br/><br/>On the broader subject of freeforms and multiforms, could you talk a little about the culture of GM/Player trust that seems to be involved? I think you mentioned it a bit earlier upthread, regarding some social expectations about things players should and shouldn't do at certain stages of game play. I'm also very interested in that, especially regarding the sort of unspoken understanding that there are periods that a player goes through when they are somewhat or mostly immune to things that might take the actual person out of the game ( character death mostly I'd imagine), followed by a period of more "gloves off" style of play.<br/><br/>{This is actually a pretty good match up with my own style of play with more traditional types of  sceario based TTRPG play, especially with D&amp;D and CoC}                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
