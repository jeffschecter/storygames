But its more than that, the grid just feels too busy for me, and when I change the settings to have a single column, it barely fills the screen. Add to that comments are tiny in the scheme of things, they feel cramped. <br/><br/>Then there's the filtering. I tried to post a custom class I made to the Monster of the week roadhouse and it had to be approved before anyone could see it, which i get is because I don't use G+ and its spam protection. But I guess I wonder what we don't see. <br/><br/>The the true core of the issue is that, I guess I just don't understand what to do with the site. I mean I don't really do play by post (or over hangouts rather), I like reading some articles/thoughts/knew shiny projects, but I just feel tired after trying to read through just a little bit of it, it feels all at once too much and too little. I have read other posts about it on here and people say that it gets better the more you use it and that makes sense.<br/><br/>So why do I care I guess? I mean I can come here for more in depth stuff cool, but G+ isn't going away and in terms of getting stuff out there, which I will need to do at times, no way around that, I will need to have some* presence there. I keep thinking where do I start?<br/><br/>Honestly social media to me has become exhausting, and I am way more productive when I am not investing time in it. More to the point I actually do make stuff when I don't look at other peoples stuff for a while, otherwise it feels like why bother? Everyone else is humming along without you. But then you have to come back, you need to connect what your making to <i>somebody</i> otherwise why are you making it?<br/><br/>/personal digression&gt;                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_464166">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/464166/#Comment_464166" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-06-18T23:15:18+00:00" title="June 18, 2017 11:15PM">June 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            (Kenny_J, for what it's worth, I'm in total agreement!)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
