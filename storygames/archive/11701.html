Is it an item? A map? The location of something? A portal key? Is she a portal key herself?<br/>- Whatever Inciril has that people want, Mordecai has to want it to. But he has to be kept from simply seizing it. Why does he work with her? And what does his Lawful Good patron god (Bahamut, maybe) want him to do?<br/>- How do I tie Hakeem into the relationship web aside from "these sisters hired me"? Or is it better to have a character on the fringe to accomodate less players?<br/>- Where do they start? <br/>- Where are they going?<br/>- Who is chasing them and why?<br/><br/>Help me, old-school Planescape fans!

Obviously, what sort of portal would Bahamut care about? A portal directly into his own celestial realm. He doesn't know exactly where it opens out, so he can't just guard it on his end, and like all gods he's forbidden direct interference on the Sigil end. Killing her to prevent it from being a threat that might be used against him would obviously be wrong, as would imprisoning her forever for something that really isn't her fault, and Lawful Good still means something, damn it. But she's a thief/assassin, so having one of his paladins keep an eye on her would be... very awkward. But fortunately, being the god of dragons means having more money than anybody in the world would know what to do with, so let's just bribe this especially greedy but fairly competent dwarf to make sure she doesn't fall into the wrong hands? If anyone tries to bribe him to get her, Bahamut's promised to just double it, so it's sort of in Mordecai's interests to have her catch the eye of particularly wealthy enemies of Bahamut, but still manage to keep her out of their clutches.<br/><br/>Hakeem's just along for the ride. Storytellers are always chasing new and interesting experiences, and he knows enough about the city that it's worth putting up with him. (My instincts say to make him a Sensate, so I see a Key for experiencing exciting new sensations,which are sure to happen plenty around a macGuffin like Inciril, and a key for giving useful advice)<br/><br/>So, demons are chasing her because, well, backdoor into one of their strongest enemies' domains, bet that'd curry them some favor with their dark infernal/abyssal/hadean masters. Wizards and other adventurers are chasing her because, well, the god of dragons has the mother of all treasure hordes. Ding! Mercykillers are chasing her because, well, she <i>IS</i> an assassin, and being Lawful Neutral still means something, damn it! Plus, she's the mother of all disturbances to the peace these days.<br/><br/>I'd open with them trying to settle down all low-key-like in some Sigil tavern (because being a D&amp;D based setting still means something, damn it!), and then some demons having drinks and playing dice in the corner somewhere recognize her as the key of prophecy that all their masters are so hot to get their claws, tentacles, and other various and sundry appendages on.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261194">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261194/#Comment_261194" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T09:53:11+00:00" title="March 10, 2010  9:53AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks, Ben!

And maybe the Mercykillers are after her because she <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">killed someone</span> put someone in the dead book.<br/><br/>Also, making Hakeem a Sensate is a good idea. I made him an Indep more out of lack of inspiration than anything else. (Edited first post to indicate factions for the characters).<br/><br/>I like the idea that Mordecai is a black-hearted bastard, and has to serve Bahamut purely out of bitter obligation, rather than for hope of gain.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_261215">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Judd" title="Judd"><img alt="Judd" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/495/nRFUZ52CJV6AO.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Judd">Judd</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261215/#Comment_261215" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T10:31:45+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 10:31AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited March 10, 2010 10:32AM by Judd.">edited March 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="http://githyankidiaspora.wordpress.com/2005/12/09/planescape-via-tsoy/" rel="nofollow">Here are some Planescape inspired keys for TSoY that might help.</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_261226">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter" title="Brian_Minter"><img alt="Brian_Minter" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/272/n5ERIYFVJDS1O.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Brian_Minter">Brian_Minter</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/261226/#Comment_261226" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-03-10T10:56:10+00:00" title="March 10, 2010 10:56AM">March 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Whoa!
