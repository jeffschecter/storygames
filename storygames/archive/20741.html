I'm a non-religious person myself so I usually approach heavily religious creations with a certain bias, but I was pleasantly surprised with this game. I think you've managed to embed the themes you want to explore into the game so that it doesn't require overt reference to its religious roots, while the 'Designing a "Mormon" RPG' section was an interesting separate infobox about its background. I can imagine myself playing this and enjoying the themes it offers.<br/><br/>I've got some questions and observations about the basic moves:<br/><br/>Discern the Situation, with a 10+, are there any limits to what you can ask? Can I ask, for example, 'what are my enemy's secret plans'? Also about the 7-9, I'd think a player wants to trigger this move when they need info about a specific thing, while the GM may answer about something entirely unrelated if they get a weak success.<br/><br/>Strike Down, how much harm does this deal to a player? 1? What's a situation where choosing 'Your intent is thwarted' doesn't ruin my weak success?<br/><br/>Rebuke with Truth, what specifically happens if their hearts are softened?<br/><br/>I'm not sure if you've intended this draft to be usable by anyone else than you as GM, but I'd need more info on starting a new campaign, building the situation and using the situation sheet (page 10).<br/><br/>I hope this helps, good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455740">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy" title="NYpurdy"><img alt="NYpurdy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/806/nOF4TMGUDI1JH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy">NYpurdy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455740/#Comment_455740" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T03:40:42+00:00" title="August 23, 2016  3:40AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Glowie!<br/><br/>My hope is to get this in a state where it can be (relatively easily) used by someone else!<br/><br/>I looked at your suggestions and glanced by editing eye over the basic moves again. What do you (and anyone else) think about these edits:<br/><br/>\u25cf Discern the Situation. When you study a situation and apply your wits or intuition, Ask a question about the situation and roll+Guile. On a 10+ you gain insight through your own perception or from a spark of Divine inspiration, receive an honest answer from either the GM or another Player. On a 7-9, the GM tells you something important and unexpected about the situation at hand.<br/><br/>\u25cf Strike Down. When you strike with the intent to disarm, harm, or kill, roll+Body. On a 10+, you achieve your aim. If you successfully Strike Down a player character deal +1 harm. On a 7-9, you may choose to abandon your attack. Otherwise your blow lands, but choose one. *They deal harm in return *You're in a vulnerable position<br/><br/>\u25cf Rebuke with Truth. When you attempt to influence another by boldly declaring truth, roll+Blood. On a 10+, they are moved by your words and their hearts are softened by their truth and they will follow through on your message, at least for the time being. On a 7-9, they hear your words, make an Oath with them or choose 1. *They are moved to act on your words *They mean you no ill or harm. If you attempt to Rebuke with Truth another PC on a 10+, both. On a 7-9, choose 1: \u25cf if they act on your words, they mark experience \u25cf if they resist, they are acting despite tribulation.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455742">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Glowie" title="Glowie"><img alt="Glowie" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Glowie">Glowie</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455742/#Comment_455742" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-23T08:00:03+00:00" title="August 23, 2016  8:00AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Discern The Situation: I'd say this works fine as a generic information gathering move. Something to consider is that these kinds of moves often use lists of questions to both limit your questions to thematically appropriate ones and guide your thinking and play toward intended goals. Playtesting should show whether this is something you want.<br/><br/>Strike Down: Does striking down deal a base harm of X to PCs and then +1 or is it just 1 harm? Otherwise I understand how to use this now. Is your intention to give the player a second chance if they roll 7-9 by changing the situation somehow ("they beg for mercy, do you still strike them down?")? I'd think they'd never abandon their attack if nothing has changed after the roll.<br/><br/>Rebuke with Truth: Seems solid!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455796">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy" title="NYpurdy"><img alt="NYpurdy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/806/nOF4TMGUDI1JH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy">NYpurdy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455796/#Comment_455796" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-26T03:46:50+00:00" title="August 26, 2016  3:46AM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've updated the PDF with more description of the Setting Sheet as well as fleshing out some more of the bulk of the rules.

Being a non-religious person raised in the church I would like to talk about how the game is framed by the Book of Mormon (BoM) and your religions experience. My personal opinion is that referring to the BoM in the title will turn off non-Mormons and that they won't give your game a chance; I think they will make assumptions about the theme or just assume it is not for them. I also think the personal, biographical statements about your faith could have the same effect. While it may feel as though mentioning the BoM in the title gives you a built-in audience, I think it will ultimately limit your audience. If the game is good it will stand on its own merits. I think the best approach to take is the approach Vincent Baker took with Dogs In the Vineyard. We all know what inspired Dogs In The Vineyard, yet Vincent never was explicit about it or hit people over the head with it, and he was still able to give people an idea of what the game was about. I think if you are trying to get as many people as possible to play your game and to give your game a chance, you should follow a similar approach. Of course, I know that these are extremely personal decisions; I just thought I would offer my perspective. I wish you well on your endeavor :-)                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455852">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy" title="NYpurdy"><img alt="NYpurdy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/806/nOF4TMGUDI1JH.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/NYpurdy">NYpurdy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455852/#Comment_455852" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-08-27T19:32:26+00:00" title="August 27, 2016  7:32PM">August 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thank you, Jeff!
