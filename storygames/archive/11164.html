One thing that's extremely difficult for the form is that centralization is virtually impossible. The form is mostly illegal in America (relying as it does on the reproduction of copyrighted and often trademarked characters) and virtually none of the practicioners are willing to pay for it, given that there's so many free sites (rpol, Yahoogroups, etc.) that will give them what they currently want for free.  So there's not much advancement in the form over the last five years - the games that collapsed five years ago collapsed for the same reasons and in the same ways and the ones that are collapsing now are collapsing.  They seem crude because institutional pressures have set them up to remain crude. What you are observing is what tabletop roleplaying would look like if printed material was banned.<br/><br/>There've been a lot of threads about it here in the past, I bet you could find some on search.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248214">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate" title="mike_the_pirate"><img alt="mike_the_pirate" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y4/r_goulet/smalliconmike.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/mike_the_pirate">mike_the_pirate</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248214/#Comment_248214" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-22T23:31:45+00:00" title="December 22, 2009 11:31PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            RPGs are hard to classify with a single brush, and this guy's post proves why!

It was called the Edda of Rhye, and was set in a mostly non-magical (only stuff like priestly miracles was allowed) Medieval town called Rhye. The core players, who founded it and drove most of what went on, were adults in their late 20s. Some others were in their early 20s, and there were a few teenagers, of which I was one.<br/><br/>I recall the introduction to it stating clearly that "this is not a numbers game, like D&amp;D" and a number of other remarks that disparaged the math-and-resource driven play of D&amp;D and its ilk.<br/><br/>I found the game very, very, very difficult to play. This was due to the lack of an overt system, beyond PM negotiation, through which to affect the fiction. (Unlike TT RPers, they didn't get all sweaty when you called it "the fiction" instead of "the gameworld," and I consider that a good thing). I constantly froze, because I had no handles to hold on to.<br/><br/>At the time, I was also playing and designing Purist-for-System Right to Dream games. Which weren't the sorts of games for these people, I could tell, and I was okay with that. I was also interested in getting into what they were doing, which had, like, y'know, plot and stuff, without being pre-scripted by one person.<br/><br/>I wish I could get in contact with those guys again, meet up in real life, and play Sorcerer or Rustbelt or something with them. I think they'd love it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_248344">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/248344/#Comment_248344" name="Item_35" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2009-12-23T15:13:36+00:00" title="December 23, 2009  3:13PM">December 2009</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 23, 2009 3:13PM by JDCorley.">edited December 2009</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I really think everyone who plays RPGs should play in a lot of different play-by-forum or -Yahoogroup freeform games, preferably based on a fan property of some kind.
