Ulysses isn't comfortable there, but does his best to peacock around and get some respect.  Bruno tries to exhert power over the D.A., but it isn't happening.  Bruno shows Ulysses the photos of Senator Greene.  Ulysses recognizes one of the boys that Bruno used for the shots, and tells him to get rid of him.  "We can't have that pointing back to us."<br/>Bruno is hurt by this, because he and Tony go way back.  "I've known him since Texas.  We both moved out here together.  He's one of my boys."  But a deal's a deal, and the D.A. insists he won't have anything to do with this unless Tony gets whacked.<br/><br/>Scene two - Ulysses Frames<br/>Ulysses comes back to the office after a "long lunch."  He and Georgie-O talk heatedly about Ulysses's wife, who was rather upset to be ditched yet again.  But Ulysses says it was just business.  Georgie-O and Ulysses talk a little too loud about Ulysses's affairs, and an unnoticed reporter takes notes before slipping out.<br/><br/>Scene three - Georgie Frames<br/>Georgie goes to the boxing club to "hook up" with Allison.  She's all on him, but she's asking him more about himself.  She wants to know where he works, why she hasn't met any of his friends.  Georgie tells her she's a nobody, that she doesn't have any friends.  That he works for the D.A. and that's all she needs to know.  Allison is so smitten that she takes it all in stride.<br/><br/>Scene four - Allison Frames<br/>Allison goes in to see Bruno about some papers.  He tells her she shouldn't be messing with Georgie in the club, that nobody wants to hear all that noise and racket.  She brushes that off and takes control of the situation, insisting she has more workers for him.  He relents, and then asks her for help getting some papers.  Bruno wants a paper trail making it look like Tony is moving to Canada.<br/><br/>Scene five - Bruno Resolves<br/>Tony shows up at the boxing club.  He's ecstatic.  That girl that Bruno introduced him to three months ago?  She's pregnant.  "We're getting married, Bruno.  I'm so happy.  I've never been so happy Bruno, and it's all thanks to you and what you done for me.  Bruno I love her so much."  Tony gushes as Bruno swallows hard.  He tells Tony that he needs his help with a few things, that he needs Tony to take this shopping list and be back at 2 am.  That he should put his woman on a plane and tell her that he'll follow soon.<br/><br/>Scene six - Ulysses Frames<br/>Ulysses bumps into Allison at the immigration office.  Neither have met before, but being the D.A. and seeing a strong woman who seems to know everyone, he can't help but introduce himself.  She says her first and last name, which gives the D.A. pause.  "Clinton is a strong last name."  When she finds out Ulysses is the D.A. she says "You must know my Georgie! The young man I'm seeing."  Ulysses makes some calculations, but doesn't say anything.<br/><br/>Scene seven - Georgie Frames<br/>Georgie goes to Bruno to figure out what's what, and to find out what's going on with Tony, who they both know.  Bruno tells Georgie to be back at 2am, and that he's gonna need his help.  Bruno opens the safe and hands Georgie a gun with the numbers filed off, and then takes it back with a cloth (keeping Georgie's prints on it.)  Everything's going to be fine, just come back at 2.<br/><br/>Scene eight - Allison<br/>Allison encounters Ulysses and lets him know that Bruno is looking to work some papers to get Tony out of the country.  Allison doesn't know that Bruno is actually trying to kill Tony.  Ulysses is confused, and thinks Bruno might be trying to double-cross him, but he's grateful for the information.  Allison is so happy to see Georgie that she lets slip that she wants to marry him.  Ulysses says "The courts tend to look down on that type of thing."  Ulysses lets the cat out of the bag, and Georgie and Allison are at each other with words.<br/></blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_389411">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin" title="Harlequin"><img alt="Harlequin" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/742/nXKNTZJYC1VYG.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Harlequin">Harlequin</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/389411/#Comment_389411" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-09-06T10:29:39+00:00" title="September  6, 2012 10:29AM">September 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>TILT!<br/>Innocence - Collateral damage<br/>Failure - You thought it was taken care of but it wasn't<br/><br/>Scene nine - <br/><br/>Scene ten - Ulysses Resolves<br/>[Tilt! * Innocence - Collateral damage]<br/>Georgie shows up with information.  Ulysses wife has been "run over" with a car fresh from Bruno's line.  Georgie is trying to convince Ulysses that Bruno is after him, that he's siding with Senator Greene.  Ulysses won't hear it, and lectures Georgie on how things "are."  No matter what it appears, Ulysses needs to count on Georgie to see through this, that Greene is behind all this.  He leaves to be with his wife and tells Georgie to look after things.<br/><br/>Scene eleven - Georgie Resolves<br/>Senator Greene makes an appearance at the D.A.'s office to "offer condolences" and to gloat a bit.  Georgie is spun up too far from Ulysses's speech earlier, and knows what he has to do.  Allison shows up, upset with Georgie for treating her like a whore, telling him it's all his fault.  Greene is eating up this controversy.  Allison tells Georgie that she's late, which is enough of a distraction that Georgie pulls out a gun and plugs Greene.  One bullet isn't enough.  Even as Allison is screaming, Georgie keeps firing.  He drops one clip and loads another, still firing.  [Tilt! * Innocence - Collateral damage]  Allison passes out, and the stress and shock cause her to miscarry.  Georgie is too busy cleaning up after Greene to notice.<br/><br/>Scene twelve - Allison Resolves<br/>Ulysses stumbles into Allison's room, partially in a daze.  He's distraught at watching his wife in her last few moments.  He sits by her bed, talking to the ceiling or the floor.  She admits that she miscarried, that Georgie was too busy to take her, so she got herself to the hospital.  Ulysses admits that he admires her, despite everything else, and that he'd like to do something for her.<br/>Georgie reveals himself, that he's snuck into Allison's room and is hiding out from the cops.  There is awkwardness and confusion, and Ulysses excuses himself to be with his wife again.  Still, he makes a promise to remember Allison in all this.<br/><br/>Scene thirteen - Bruno Resolves<br/>Tony shows at the club at 2am.  "Bruno it was wonderful, so nice, that money you gave me?  I bought her a nice dress.  It was so pretty, Bruno.  She was so pretty.  We went ahead and got married, Bruno.  Just this afternoon.  It's all thank to you Bruno. And we didn't have a honeymoon just yet, Bruno, but we will.  And she was tearin' up, and she looked so nice.  And I never did have a picture of myself taken in my whole life, but I got a photographer for her, Bruno, and in her dress and everything.  And she's not even showing yet or nothin' Bruno, but she's glowin.  And we went to the airport, Bruno, and I put her on the plane and she was still in her dress, Bruno, still in her weddin dress, and all the stewardesses were so nice to her and so happy for her and -"<br/>Georgie comes up from behind with a rope and strangles Tony.  Tony looks confused, one hand around the rope, the other reaching out to Bruno for help...<br/>Georgie and Bruno pull guns on one another, looking to take advantage of the situation...<br/>[Tilt! * Failure - You thought it was taken care of but it wasn't]<br/>Tony is just passed out, suddenly comes back to.  He's got a 22 tucked in his sock, and he plugs them both in the guts and runs off, noose still around his throat...<br/><br/>Scene fourteen - Ulysses Resolves<br/>Ulysses shows up to the boxing club late.  His wife has died.  He is shaken.  He sees Tony fleeing, rope around his neck, panicked.  Ulysses resolves himself.  Even if he's got to do it, it's getting done.  Ulysses walks into the night, knowing where Tony lives, gun in hand.<br/><br/>Scene fifteen - Georgie Resolves<br/>Georgie and Bruno have passe out, and then woken again hours later.  It's perhaps 5am.  They both abuse each other verbally, trying to muster the strength to finish the job.  Allison walks in on this scene, dumps the forged immigration papers on Bruno's blood-stained body, and finishes Georgie off.  Allison takes a modest amount of money from Bruno's safe and leaves.<br/><br/>Scene sixteen - Allison Resolves<br/>Allison is an an airport, about to head North for the vineyards.  She bumps in to her estranged uncle, Georgie's dad.  She says "you should check in on your son sometime."  The uncle find out where she's heading and parts on nice terms.  "You'll like it up there.  You got a couple of cousins up in those hills."<br/><br/>Aftermath!<br/>Bruno ends up with a zero.  He wraps himself in the plastic he had laid down for Tony's execution and wriggles his way out, but he gets busted anyhow.  The cops raid his place and find all sorts of photos he was plannin to blackmail people with, but it turns out some of the models he used were a little too young.  In trying to patch him up, the doctors screw him up bad.  He's paralyzed from the waist down, and he's doin his business with the aid of a machine.  In prison, they don't take kindly to him, believing him to be some perverted child-molester, and he is in the shit for the rest of his life... 81 more years of it.<br/><br/>Ulysses ends up no better or worse.  A new Senator is in power, but indications are the same.  The funeral is tasteful, and he is shaking hands.  The chief prosecutor admits that they have no leads in the bizarre murder of some Texas native who was found shot with a noose around his neck.<br/><br/>Georgie is dead, and our third player has rolled up a pretty bad ending.  Without a tether, he insist that a friend of Georgie's goes on a revenge shooting at Ulysses's funeral, not managing to actually kill Ulysses, but scandalizing the affair and putting Ulysses into paranoia.<br/><br/>Allison ends up living out her days alone.  She didn't have enough to retire, and she couldn't get close to anyone after what happened with Georgie.</blockquote>\nThanks for raedin all that...  it was a pretty awesome game.
