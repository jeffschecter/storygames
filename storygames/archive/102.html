                    I've placed this discussion in Praxis! because I think it's a marketing issue.<br/><br/>I've noticed that, save for one or two big mainstream systems or settings, the majority of games mentioned here (what are you playing? what do you want to play?) seem to come from folks active in public design at the Forge.<br/><br/>That's fine: well and good. Hear, hear.<br/><br/>However, I've also noticed that there's a tier of small press/self-pub/indie games that don't seem to get mentioned as much. That, of course, is the tier I seem to be in. I'm talking <i>FATE</i>, <i>Truth &amp; Justice</i>, <i>Cat</i>, <i>InSpectres</i>,  and other such games. <br/><br/>I made a joke blurb for my company's games a while ago: "Too indie for the mainstream, and too mainstream for the indie." But now I wonder if that's really, honestly true. Many of the games I mention above are fairly mainstream in the way they handle narration, player empowerment, and play-style. <br/><br/>I've been wondering why these Other Indie Games aren't getting a quarter as much attention as, say, <i>Polaris</i> or <i>The Shab-al-Hiri-Roach</i> -- and that's no disrespect for these two games, not at all. I've been shocked to hear that multiple folks on this message board hadn't ever heard of <i>T&amp;J</i>, for example.<br/><br/>Does anyone have any ideas?<br/><br/><hr/><br/>So I'm trying an experiment, here in this small community, to expose at least one Other Indie Game to folks who may not have seen it.<br/><br/>First, feel free to check out <a href="http://www.story-games.com/forums/comments.php?DiscussionID=83" rel="nofollow">this thread</a> on <i>T&amp;J</i> resources -- previews, freebies, etc.<br/><br/>If you like what you see, you can use the following coupon to get the PDF of <i>T&amp;J</i> from RPGNow at a $5 discount -- that is, $8. Additionally, if you later want to purchase the PoD version, the $8 you spend will be deducted from the $25 cost of the print copy. (Alas, RPGNow coupons don't carry through to PoDs yet.) <br/><br/>This coupon is only available to folks on this message board; I will not be posting it anywhere else. Click on this code to get the coupon price:<br/><br/><a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/?coupon=29873" rel="nofollow">http://www.rpgnow.com/?coupon=29873</a><br/><br/>Also, the coupon will expire on March 1, 2006.<br/><br/><br/>CU                </div>

                            I think, maybe, if your game resembles the mainstream games, that's a big reason why it's not getting as much attention. In fact, you mention FATE, and I look at the preview info and reference charts and character generation worksheet, and it kind of looks like FATE to me, and I already have that.<br/>
<br/>
Stuff like Polaris is different from mainstream on a molecular level. That game is made out of some kind of mineral compound scientists don't have a name for yet. There's no question that play is going to be way different.<br/>
<br/>
But for the gamers who like their regular traditional stuff just fine, there's less motivation for them to step away from Champions or M&amp;M or FUDGE or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I think Clinton's TSOY isn't selling as well as it deserves for similar reasons. People already have a ton of fantasy games that all kinda seem the same except for superficial stuff like dice pools and whatever. The stuff that makes it kick ass -- keys and secrets in particular -- needs to be yelled really loudly.<br/>
<br/>
So what's the kickass stuff in T&amp;J? <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe I'll get it and come back and tell you what I think it is. I mean, if you're gonna be handing out coupons and all...                        </div>

<i>Well, first there's the social issue. Ben's active in internet communities that I frequent. To be blunt? You're not. At least for me, that's a big factor.</i><br/><br/>I can see that. My overall internet community activity has reduced from a couple years back. While I have posted the odd message to the Forge and post about once a week to RPGnet, that's enough to fall off of many folks' radar.<br/><br/>(Hm. Now that I think about it, the majority of my internet community activity happens on LiveJournal.)<br/><br/>Here's a question related to community activity: given two similar actively folks, if one "designs in the open" and one "designs away from the forum" -- would (all other things being equal) you be more interested in talking to/about the former or the latter game?<br/><br/><i>And then ... how to say this? People may look at the two games and judge, from what they can discover, that Polaris is the better game.</i><br/><br/>Possibly. However, I think that <i>Polaris</i> and <i>T&amp;J</i> (at least) are miles apart from one another in method, genre, and play, and comparing the two is sort of like apples and oranges. (I'd lump <i>Polaris</i> as closer to MLwM or <i>The Mountain Witch</i> or even <i>Caps</i>, based on methods of play or constrained situations).<br/><br/><i>I just think when you're looking around in confusion wondering "How is it that one game can be more popular than another?" that putting the obvious possibility on your list of things to consider is a healthy mental exercise.</i><br/><br/>Agreed. However, I think an equally likely case is that some of these games are doing things in a way that is more palatable to the current audience (what I'm talking about regarding "mainstream" and "indie" styles).<br/><br/><i>Why have Ron and Vincent and Clinton never posted anything about playing Capes, but post loads about PTA? Well, I gotta consider the very real possibility that PTA is a more attractive game to them, right? Like ... they might not be playing it by accident.</i><br/><br/>Or maybe that someone ran a session for them, and they dug it. Again, not an accident. . . but it changes the issue from "attraction" to "availability."<br/><br/>All good points, Tony! Thanks!<br/><br/>CU                        </div>

<i>I think, maybe, if your game resembles the mainstream games, that's a big reason why it's not getting as much attention.</i><br/><br/>I think so. I'm interested in figuring out why. I mean, what's the common feature of this "indie" vibe or hunger among the audience. (Kneejerk response is that it really plays towards the "GM who wishes to play" personality, or the "game-playing storyteller" personality -- once who can systematize dramatic/fictional characters -- which is an "active participation" type; mainstream games might be playing to a "reactive participation" type... It's a vague, holey theory.)<br/><br/><i> In fact, you mention FATE, and I look at the preview info and reference charts and character generation worksheet, and it kind of looks like FATE to me, and I already have that.</i><br/><br/>While similar to FATE, T&amp;J is more the bastard offspring of MSH, Castle Falk, and OtE than anything else (though there is a vague resemblance to FUDGE, which was picked up by osmosis more than anything else).<br/><br/><i>Stuff like Polaris is different from mainstream on a molecular level. That game is made out of some kind of mineral compound scientists don't have a name for yet. There's no question that play is going to be way different.</i><br/><br/>Exactly. I'm wondering if the taste for that mineral compound includes an allergy for the mainstream mineral compound in a large proportion of the audience. Obviously not all: I know plenty of folks who dig both flavors, but I also know folks who dig one but not the other.<br/><br/><i>I think Clinton's TSOY isn't selling as well as it deserves for similar reasons. People already have a ton of fantasy games that all kinda seem the same except for superficial stuff like dice pools and whatever. The stuff that makes it kick ass -- keys and secrets in particular -- needs to be yelled really loudly.</i><br/><br/>Agreed. I have a hardcopy of TSOY for reading shortly; it's near the top of my to read pile, and I'm very looking forward to it.<br/><br/><i>So what's the kickass stuff in T&amp;J?</i><br/><br/>Hero Points, Story Hooks, Stunts, Genre Info, and the general aesthetic of "the alien space god and the midnight detective and the water-breathing fishman all have vastly different levels of superpowers, but all have the same level of narrative power within the scene."<br/><br/><i>Or maybe I'll get it and come back and tell you what I think it is. I mean, if you're gonna be handing out coupons and all...</i><br/><br/>Right up there in post one of this thread. <br/><br/>If you diggit or don't diggit, let me know!<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>

<i>Chad, are you talking about <b>people talking</b> or <b>people playing</b> or <b>people buying</b>? They're three rather different things.</i><br/><br/>True. I'm talking about the first, which inexorably leads to the second and third.<br/><br/>TANGENT: Sales for T&amp;J have been excellent, actually. There are a number of groups playing the game, and a small but growing amount of discussion on the mailling list (mostly game-related, but I'm interested in expanding discussions to general superhero-type discussions).<br/><br/>T&amp;J also gets mentioned on RPGnet irregularly. However, it's rarely mentioned here, and almost never mentioned in the only other fora I participate in/lurk on: the Forge and the Pyramid subscriber boards.<br/><br/>The Pyramid boards are fairly understandable: the lion's share of game system discussion revolves around GURPS; though not a house organ, Pyramid attracts hardcore GURPS folks.<br/><br/>The lack of discussion at the Forge (and to a lesser extent, here at Story Games) for T&amp;J and other games of its ilk -- small press, often indie by definition, but hewing to a more "mainstream" playstyle -- intrigues me. <br/><br/>I'm trying to understand if the majority of the participants in these two places are looking for a specific flavor (the "strange mineral compound" mentioned upthread) above all other things. And, if so, why? Also, what makes that flavor so interesting so as to require repeated discussion?<br/><br/>I have a vague thought relating this to wine conneisseurship, but it's too inchoate to relate right now.<br/><br/>So, yeah, I'm curious about the talking.<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>

                            Chad, you're talking about chasing buzz, and seriously, I'd recommend abandoning that shit.  Promote your game, sure -- put it out there to be talked about, make sure it gets exposure, et cetera.  But endlessly correcting your approach to optimize the buzz so generated isn't worth your time or effort.<br/><br/>Do you have a new project you're working on right now?  Let's hear about that.  Amusingly, I find the more you talk about the game you're working on right now, the more you end up talking about how you did things last time.  I think Vincent's said that he's sold more copies of <em>puppies</em> while talking about <em>Dogs</em> than when he was only promoting the first book, too.                        </div>

                            Hey, Chad.<br/><br/>As you pointed out T&amp;J and Polaris simply sell to different markets.  It's an interesting comparison to make, since I think we're selling at exactly the same rate.<br/><br/>What you're basically asking, it seems, is "how can I get all these pervy Forge types interested in my game?"<br/><br/>Well, for one, I think a fair number of us are.  I'm really into Dead Inside.  I haven't checked out T&amp;J simply because I feel like it doesn't fill a new niche for me -- if I want to play Supers in a traditional way, I have MSH, and if I want to do crazy pervy things with Supers I have Capes and WGP... I just don't see why I would sit down and say "hey, let's play Truth and Justice."  (I do, on the other hand, see a situation where I would say 'hey, let's play Dead Inside,' so take that for what it's worth.)<br/><br/>The difference is that Truth and Justice doesn't really do anything <i>super shiny new</i> in terms of gaming.  Or, at least, the adverts and press seem to mostly be focused on "like other supers games, but incrementally better" which, if I were interested in supers games as a thing, I would totally buy.  But I'm not interested in supers games as a thing, so I give it a miss.<br/><br/>Also, and related, your choice to use a "house system" is pretty much going to drop interest from Forgies by a factor of ten or so.  Why?  Because so much of Forge discourse is about shaping play experience via shaping system, and since you aren't producing new system material, it doesn't feel like you're adding much to that discussion.  Not that you have to.<br/><br/>It seems, pretty much, that you've settled into a very nice niche -- your games provide something different for those looking for something different without being massively alien.  It's a good niche to be in, but it means that people who are fans of the massively alien are simply not going to be as interested in your work.<br/><br/>yrs--<br/>--Ben                        </div>

                            Hiya, Ben!<br/><br/><i>As you pointed out T&amp;J and Polaris simply sell to different markets. It's an interesting comparison to make, since I think we're selling at exactly the same rate.</i><br/><br/>We're fairly close, I think -- you still have the edge most definitely in hardcopy, though (if I recall numbers a-right).<br/><br/><i>What you're basically asking, it seems, is "how can I get all these pervy Forge types interested in my game?"</i><br/><br/>Somewhat, true. Again, marketing. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/>But also, a more general question of "what makes Game X more talk-aboutable than Game Y?" <br/><br/>I mean, I'm interested to see why there's relatively little discussion of Wicked Dead Brewing games, for example.<br/><br/><i>I haven't checked out T&amp;J simply because I feel like it doesn't fill a new niche for me -- if I want to play Supers in a traditional way, I have MSH, and if I want to do crazy pervy things with Supers I have Capes and WGP... I just don't see why I would sit down and say "hey, let's play Truth and Justice." (I do, on the other hand, see a situation where I would say 'hey, let's play Dead Inside,' so take that for what it's worth.)</i><br/><br/>It's worth a lot: valuable insight. <br/><br/>Would it be fair to say that it breaks down as:<br/>* Traditional Way = Go conservative (use a game long-established in your group).<br/>* Pervy Way = Go radical (use crazy new system).<br/><br/>Since you mention DI, an interesting hypothesis might be that if you have a pervy setting, it can be connected to a trad ruleset and still pull in pervyphilic players, and a trad setting with a pervy ruleset has the potential to pull in the pervyphilic players. What about tradphilic players? I wonder if it breaks down thus:<br/><br/>Trad setting, trad ruleset = tradphilic players<br/>Trad setting, pervy ruleset = A tradphilic, B pervyphilic players<br/>Pervy setting, trad ruleset - C tradphilic, D pervyphilic players<br/>Pervy setting, pervy ruleset = pervyphilic players<br/><br/>I'm interested in the ratios of A, B, C, and D. <br/><br/><i>The difference is that Truth and Justice doesn't really do anything super shiny new in terms of gaming. Or, at least, the adverts and press seem to mostly be focused on "like other supers games, but incrementally better" which, if I were interested in supers games as a thing, I would totally buy. But I'm not interested in supers games as a thing, so I give it a miss.</i><br/><br/>Gotcha, no real disagreement.<br/><br/><i>Also, and related, your choice to use a "house system" is pretty much going to drop interest from Forgies by a factor of ten or so. Why? Because so much of Forge discourse is about shaping play experience via shaping system, and since you aren't producing new system material, it doesn't feel like you're adding much to that discussion. Not that you have to.</i><br/><br/>I've been thinking this, but was saving that for a future discussion. I dig what you're saying. While I believe that play experience is definitely shaped by system (nature), I also think that they way players interact around the table with each other and the system as written is vital (nurture).<br/><br/>PDQ, for me, hits all the buttons I've been looking for in trad gaming (GM/player divide). It works well enough vanilla for both nature and -- in my personal play gorups -- nurture, and can be flavored via tweaks and genre-specific subsystems to various genres as necessary.<br/><br/>However, I've been extremely interested in some of the rules and ideas in more pervy games -- like, say, <i>Pretender</i> and <i>Polaris</i> and <i>The Mountain Witch</i> -- for distributing narrative responsibility. The concepts are very neat.<br/><br/><i>It seems, pretty much, that you've settled into a very nice niche -- your games provide something different for those looking for something different without being massively alien. It's a good niche to be in, but it means that people who are fans of the massively alien are simply not going to be as interested in your work.</i><br/><br/>Is it that the Forge and Story Games has attracted a number of people enamored of the massively alien to the exclusion of traditional stuff? (I mean, I read and try to play just about anything, pervy or vanilla; is this exceptional?)<br/><br/>If so, that's cool. I'm just kinda hoping that Story Games turns out to be a nice Neapolitan or swirl between pervy and vanilla. . . I like both flavors, depending upon the day.<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>

As I've always held: word-of-mouth sells games. However, this can get held hostage to social cliques (not using this in a perjorative sense) that focus on one layer of the market. <br/><br/>It's as true for folks who only play AD&amp;D 1st ed. as those who only play the Flavor of the Month from the Forge.<br/><br/>I wonder if it's possible to attract the attention of folks in the different layers? <br/><br/>While possible, I doubt having published work under the same byline in different layers would draw a ton of attention... Conversion documents to other layer systems is slightly better, but still vague. <br/><br/>Hm. Maybe this is why media tie-ins have been long-seen as a Holy Grail for cutting across the layers -- the marketing of a major media license is much more robust across the entire fanbase than any company or group of companies within a single layer could muster.<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>

Do you think the fact that I have several blind playtest groups running in paralllel with my personal playtest groups may be a factor?

I ran a demo/playtest of <i>MNPR Deluxe</i> at the last Eve Con, but that was one of the last cons I've been to. (Real Life and Money Issues have interfered since ASMP was founded to prevent con-going, and since I've never really been a con-goer before, it's easy to see why not much has taken place.)<br/><br/>However, at GenConSoCal, the T&amp;J FAQmeister ran a demo that was fairly well received, and a bunch of folks from the Yahoo Group are planning on running games.

                            Interesting discussion...<br/>
<br/>
I am in the same boat.<br/>
<br/>
My first indie game is a success as far as I can tell.. Eldritch Ass Kicking was put out in a completely do-it-yourself model, then I added art in a sort of "art-enriched" version. Then, Jason Blair (key20) approached me and said, "Let's publish it." So we did... And it has sold okay...<br/>
<br/>
But is it a cutting edge indie design? No. It's sort of traditional, though it's hella fun. I've yet to have a bad experience playing it -- it's an easy game for gamers to get and have fun with.<br/>
<br/>
My follow up game was never intended to be a complete game... it just popped out that way. Barbarians Versus is a similar style game, playing on whacky fantasy tropes with reckless glee. It's a fun system, easy to get, and action-oriented. However, it also hasn't gotten much play.<br/>
<br/>
I don't have time to post a lot to forums... I don't have time to cultivate buzz. I'm a full time grad student right now, balancing a bit of game design in with my studies. So, I do what I can.<br/>
<br/>
I guess in essence, I feel you, CU. The more time I spend at the Forge, the less helpful the Forge is to me. The more time I spend on Rpg.net, the less of a life I have. I wish I could just sell games and have fun doing this without worrying about posting on the net all the time... or cultivating buzz... or marketing and what not. I just like playing and designing games.                        </div>

<p>Forgive me if I'm being too glib, but it seems to me like there isn't any problem here at all.  The boat you're in appears to be a fantastic one to be in.  I mean, you didn't say that you like playing, designing and <em>selling</em> games, right?</p>
<p>So, if you play and you design, and your designs occationally sell without any buzz or marketing, then I'd say you're doing pretty good.  Pretty damned good in fact.</p>
<p>Am I wrong?</p>

                            For what it's worth, I designed Dogs in the Vineyard totally in private. I had a hidden playtesters' forum on the Forge with about 20 people reading and posting, that's all; when I showed up at the Forge booth at GenCon with a new game, practically no one knew anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
It was people who bought it at GenCon writing about their prep and then actual play that created the game's buzz. <br/>

                            Hey Chad,<br/><br/>I'm in a similar, yet smaller boat than you. I think <i>Conspiracy of Shadows</i> is in a tough spot and it requires me to constantly try and mix up my approach to how I can get it noticed.  Reviews and shit help a lot, but they are only blips on the radar and don't create lasting impressions.  I'm trying a couple of different things to try and get people to not only buy and play, but talk about their experiences, positive or negative, online.
<ul>
<li>I made an Actual Play thread on my forum and made a big link to it from my site.</li>
<li>I'm trying to target particular audiences.  Like Andy mentioned I am going after Ravenloft folks right now with running my game and creating a Wiki resource for the game as well as AP posts.</li>
<li>I post little tidbits on RPG.net to threads about conspiracy/horror crap.  Not shilling, just posting and using my signature as the marketing tool</li>
<li>I really use my blog as a draw too.  I try to write about what I am designing next as well as game issues, which often piss folks off.</li>
<li>I do freebie crap all the time.  Like the desktops I just did.  I am even offering to do them for game groups if they want a personalized one.</li>
<li>I try to be very open about everything I do, from sales figures, to answer questions, to being honest about any mistakes I have made with shit</li>
<li>Finally I try to do as much statistical analysis for my sales as possible to try and maximize what gets people interested and what doesn't.</li></ul>

<i>My first indie game is a success as far as I can tell.. Eldritch Ass Kicking was put out in a completely do-it-yourself model, then I added art in a sort of "art-enriched" version.

That's no diss on you or your game, just that I have had limited time and money. . . luckily, the time aspect has opened up a bit.)<br/><br/><i>I guess in essence, I feel you, CU.

                            I'm a Forge fuck. I play Dogs and Polaris. <br/>
<br/>
I also play Truth and Justice. <br/>
<br/>
When I talk with Chad I mostly talk about Truth and Justice. <br/>
<br/>
When I talk with Vincent or Ben I mostly talk about Dogs or Polaris. <br/>
<br/>
Why? <br/>
<br/>
It isn't that I hide my involvement in either circle, as anyone who reads my blogs and shit will know the kinds and varieties of games I play (I alternate bog trad Exalted sim with Bliss Stage playtest and so on).<br/>
<br/>
However, historically the two have been different communities, and haven't always been really open to each other. I know folks who call certain kinds of gaming "stupid play" and others who complain about "crazy moon language." (And I, as usual, half agree and half disagree with both.) As I'm both a socially compartmentalized sort and a syncretic thinker I spend most of my time in public talking with the community I am in about the things they want to talk about, and much of my time in private working out the ways in which the tenants of the different communities interact at my own table.<br/>
<br/>
This has also, in some situations, lead to me not participating in communities because I get tired of one set of "friends" talking constant shit about the other set of "friends." <br/>
<br/>
And to kick in on the side note: I've actually played Enemy Gods and Cat. I've never, to my remembrance, talked about playing either because no one in the blogsphere talks about playing either. <br/>
<br/>
The other problem is that I'm both to busy and to lazy to post a lot of Actual Play reports. Maybe I should start doing so, as I know they are awesome good for both theory and sales. Chad and Keith have both told me that I'm a fuck for not posting about my CoS and T&amp;J games, and I think they're right to do so. Buzz is for shit, but talking about the game actually being played and how it works in real terms is a wonderful tool in many, many ways. <br/>
<br/>
Finally, I have to say that (fortunately or un) the reason that a lot of games kick harder at first and get better buzz to start with has much to do with novelty. I know many people whose heads turned towards Dogs because of the "pseudo-Mormon paladins in the old west that never was" aspect. Or grooved on Polaris because it was "just so different." Long before there was substantial actual play going on with a lot of these groups, there was a lot of buzz because of the newness of the game. <br/>
<br/>
Conspiracy of Shadows and Truth and Justice both, I think, suffered in initial surge because of that lack of novelty. Another horror game and another supers game, says the jaded public, ho humÃ¢â‚¬Â¦. <br/>
<br/>
Of course quality counts in the end. Novelty wears off, and we all know the reams of RPG.net favorites of the month that now fill the discount bins of FLGSs throughout the world. Dogs and Polaris will stick it out because they deliver beyond the initial cool factor. CoS and T&amp;J will too, as they both have quality.                        </div>

                            Thanks for the comments.<br/>
<br/>
First, to Eric, yeah -- you have a point. Sometimes, I do feel really jazzed about the whole thing. I mean, I was at Gencon, at the Key20 booth, demoing my game the whole time. It was fun (despite the fact I was dead sick). It's been a fun ride, all in all.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know -- sometimes, I get caught in the capitalistic notion that I should be selling scads of product to be successful. And that if my game isn't getting talked about everywhere, then I'm not doing well... or I think that I should be marketing it so it can get big...<br/>
<br/>
But yeah -- I have to take some time to figure out why I am doing what I am doing.<br/>
<br/>
Keith -- thanks for posting your strategy. I really need to do more Actual Play stuff. It's a better way to talk about your game without shilling.<br/>
<br/>
I have largely avoided doing sales and coupons for Barbarians Versus on RPGNow. I just don't want to turn this thing into "selling my game" as the focus. And I try to model my approach after my own habits -- I rarely buy supplements. Some supplements for game lines look great, but I just don't. So, I don't really want to release supplements.<br/>
<br/>
If folks won't buy your game for $4, then why would they buy it for $3? Is it just the price? I feel like I'm rambling here... Definitely, the selling aspect can be very frustrating for small press designers.<br/>

No worries not knowing my game my man.  Not everyone is crazy like fucking Ron who buys every damn thing out there.<br/><br/>As to why we (EAK, T&amp;J, CoS, etc.) are not on the radar, I think it has to do with several things.  Name recognition and rep helps tons.  It is the same as branding and can only get you on the radar after a time of hard work.  <br/><br/>Creating a community to support a game is also key to getting on that radar.  Just ask Luke Crane and how much work he put in going to cons and shit to get his name and game to be in people's heads.<br/><br/>Innovation or gimicky shit helps get you on the Forge crowd, who like to talk about that shit.  They like to talk and talk and talk about it endlessly.  Not to denegrate the pervy games.  I like a lot of them.  It just so happens that their core audience is a vocal bunch of fuckers, which is great for popping up on the radar.<br/><br/><i>Again, I'm not convinced that the author's the right person to do this.

No I started a thread with links to all the APs I can find on the web for <i>Conspiracy of Shadows</i> and got a big link to them from my site.

It is good for a half hour, but any longer and the fun is gone.<br/><br/>I also split my AP posting between summaries for folks interested in that and hard analysis of play over at the Forge.  Takes a bit of work, but I think it is well worth it over time.<br/><br/>Keith                        </div>

<i>I have absolute trust in my game being played at a con without me. After all, that's the way it'll be played around gaming tables across the world. If I need to be there to make sure it goes "right," well something's amiss. (Not that I'm ascribing such a thought or opinion to you.)</i><br/><br/>Yeah, that's not what I'm talking about at all. I'm talking about the energy that my friends and I bring to demoing my game, compared to the energy that my friends would bring to demoing my game without me if I weren't there. <br/><br/>At this point, if I had a new game but couldn't make it to GenCon, I'd send it to the Forge booth anyway, of course. I'm sure my friends there would demo it and it'd sell - but I'm also sure that they wouldn't demo it as much as I would and it wouldn't sell as well. That's totally fine and fair - they'd be demoing their own games, I can't expect them to be as excited about mine as I would be.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the Forge booth in action, by the way, I don't expect you have a clear picture of what I'm talking about. The principle live at the booth is the same as the principle everywhere: actual play sells. Sit down for ten minutes with someone and show them your game in action, they're a) way more likely to buy it, then b) way more likely to play it at home, than if they just pick it up off the shelf.<br/><br/>Compared to the ongoing 10-minute demos in the booth, those scheduled 4-hour con games are useless. People can run and play those if they want - I mean, I dig it that they do - and maybe over the course of GenCon those games will even sell 4-5 books for me, that's cool. But I can sell 2-3 books an hour running demos at the booth.<br/><br/>-Vincent                        </div>

                            I love short booth demos.  I actually said to people "This is my fifteen minute demo.  If it takes more than fifteen minutes then I do the Walk of Shame ... I walk around the booth and everyone says "SHAME!  SHAAAAAME!" at me, and I totally deserve it."<br/><br/>I believe that short demos sell more game <b>per demo</b> than long demos.  I'm not merely saying "In one sixty minute demo you can sell two games, but in one ten minute demo you can sell half a game, which comes to three an hour."  I am saying "In one sixty minute demo you will sell one game, but in one ten minute demo you will sell two games ... which amounts to TWELVE an hour."<br/><br/>Real numbers are, of course, sheerest fiction to illustrate the point.                        </div>

It doesn't help that it's a niche in itself. I mean, way more people are into "superhero gaming" or "horror gaming" than "time travel gaming." So I'm not dissappointed with my (low) sales. But I am working on general awareness building - posting to appropriate threads on RPG.net, getting reviews, going to Cons and selling in person, all of that stuff. All good strategies, as far as I can tell.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also working on building some awareness for my next game, Carry, throughout the design process - pretty much all of it's development has been in the open, and doing a demo of it at Dreamation seemed to get the people who played fairly interested, so I'm going to work on that. Going to Cons, doing playtest demos, keeping in touch with those people, and (probably) letting them in on preorders and such first when it's released. This is in edition to soliciting playtesters, posting to RPG.net threads, blogging about it, etc. <br/>
<br/>
My experiment here is to see if some kind of community of interest can be built even before it's released - I think Michael Miller did something similar with the Interim Edition of With Great Power...                        </div>

I would recommend it to. You can usually make enough sales to pay for your costs while there. You can also room with other Forge-guys to make the hotel room very affordable. It's definitely worth it... and fun.\<br/>
<br/>
I did not run demos at the Forge booth, though it seemed like a fun place to be (and chaotic at times). I did some pimping at the Key20 booth. Really, there's no reason I couldn't have done both. And I don't think there is a reason there either. Basically, you could probably do something like run games at the Forge booth and then direct folks who are interested in buying the game to check out the RPGNow booth. I know folks came from the Forge booth to buy Sorcerer at the Key20 booth.<br/>
<br/>
We're all in this together.<br/>

I've heard of Timestream and the wicked cool cover lingers in my head. I hope to pick it up. I am finally getting into a situation where I have some finances to buy games again. It's kind of amazing. I finally got Dogs in the Vineyard in PDF form around November or so. Good stuff.<br/>

Chad, this notion that you somehow taint actual play reports, or would be doing some "wrong" by demonstrating your own games is, well, Crazy Moon Language. I have never seen ANYTHING remotely like "You mean SNYDER'S going to run Dust Devils? Fuck that!"<br/><br/>C'mon! Play. Report about it. Luke Crane just passed Go and just passed $200 for doing this over and over and over. Meanwhile, I managed to buy Illinois Ave. doing this. And, I've got more to come. Almost no one was playing Nine Worlds, and disappointingly few were buying. That's started (VERY slowly) to reverse now that I've got actual play in audio format online. Actual play works, and I don't think anyone has any shred of evidence that the publisher himself running the game taints the interest. I call you on being overly self-conscious. It just wastes your time "waiting" for someone else to build up some demand. I speak from experience. Just do it!<br/><br/>Also, I guaran-fucking-tee you have already sold more than three times (at LEAST, perhaps as many as ten times) as many units as I have.

<i>Chad, this notion that you somehow taint actual play reports, or would be doing some "wrong" by demonstrating your own games is, well, Crazy Moon Language. I have never seen ANYTHING remotely like "You mean SNYDER'S going to run Dust Devils? Fuck that!"</i><br/><br/>For clarity, I'm only speaking Crazy Moon Language with regard to "author tainting actual play reports" -- I think "authors demoing" is absofraggingbeautiful. (I just haven't done that.)<br/><br/><i>I don't think anyone has any shred of evidence that the publisher himself running the game taints the interest.</i><br/><br/>Not running: talking about it. 'Sdifferent.<br/><br/><i>I call you on being overly self-conscious.</i><br/><br/>I say you are a weedy pigeon and you can call me Susan if it isn't so.<br/><br/><i>It just wastes your time "waiting" for someone else to build up some demand. I speak from experience. Just do it!</i><br/><br/>You're right. Again, the main problem is time. (After March, the other main problem will go away: demoing a game in a store when the store cannot sell the game isn't much done. Not around here, anyways.)<br/><br/><i>Also, I guaran-fucking-tee you have already sold more than three times (at LEAST, perhaps as many as ten times) as many units as I have. So, sure, you're interested in expanding that to Forgers some.</i><br/> <br/>I'll post numbers in my LJ once the Jan e23 sales come in.<br/><br/><i>But, I gotta say, give me some of your audience! <img alt=";)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/wink.png" title=";)"/></i><br/><br/>And I'll get right on that after I do some more NPA games and by a copy of the latest edition of 9W for Overviewing.<br/><br/><br/>CU                        </div>

                            Really Chad, you won't come across as a jerk if you write actual play reports about your games. They're just as important as demos, in my opinion. Talk about the cool stuff that happened in your games and how the mechanics supported and created interesting situations. <br/><br/>There's a huge difference between this and shilling. Actual Play is not about "selling" the game in the way a shill is. It's writing about the stuff that has actually happened in play that got <i>you</i> excited.<br/><br/>There are a number of benefits:<br/>1. It will encourage other fans to post about their own actual play. The more AP posts out there, the better.<br/><br/>2. It gives people another example of how to use your game. Certain mechanics may not have totally clicked for them, but when they see it in your AP, they'll suddenly understand <i>why</i> the rule works the way it does.<br/><br/>3. It focuses discussion on your game and the cool stuff it does, rather than degrading into comparisons of your game versus other  games, and other conversations that aren't about play.<br/><br/>4. It gets fans who've bought the game excited about playing, reminding them what they liked about it in the first place.<br/><br/>5. It lets more people know that your game exists.                        </div>

                            Hey Chad<br/>
<br/>
You sold one more!<br/>
Thanks for the coupon.<br/>
<br/>
I also find myself in a similar situation, I've currently got three indie games up for sale, but have annoyingly had no reviews or feedback yet. I'm not sure where exactly they fit in the indie rpg continuum:<br/>
<br/>
Call To Adventure - this is more like a traditional fantasy game, but with sneaky stuff like gamist incentives for immersion and character development based on narrative goals.<br/>
<br/>
Piledrivers &amp; Powerbombs - it's pro-wrasslin, with a good bit of tactical crunch, but it's much more Forgian in its outlook (single check scene resolution - players winning narration rights).<br/>
<br/>
Swansong - Falls between the two, uses a funky tarot based mechanic but still has task resolution.<br/>
<br/>
All these games still have a GM though, which is something I'm looking to move away from, 'cos i can't be bothered to prep games!<br/>
<br/>
So if my sad tale has moved you to tears why not swing by my site!<br/>
http://www.princeofdarknessgames.com<br/>
<br/>
Actual play would be nice if my gaming group didn't hate anything even vaguely indie to the extent that they're prepared to destroy a game from the social contract level before even reading about it... <br/>
