This is going to be the fourth edition, and the 2nd summer one. As far as Italian RPG play-conventions go (all of them are small! this is not a sales-oriented industry showcase like Lucca), we could say the Summer EtrusCon is <b>huge</b>: last year 50+ players attended, and we also sported Ben Lehman as a crowd-funded guest from across the Pond. <i>And we played games all the ****ing time</i> (except when too drunk)!<br/><br/><a href="http://etruscon.blogspot.it/" rel="nofollow">Official website/blog</a><br/><br/>"Official" language is Italian, but last year's experience shows a large number of people in our scene are willing to play in English and very fond of meeting and playing with new friends from far away.<br/><br/>Anybody interested in visiting us?<br/><br/>Prices for attending are (with taxes factored in) 128.80 EUR, 111.80 EUR or 98.80 EUR per person, respectively, if staying in a single room, double/twin or a 3-beds room. This includes room &amp; board (a 2-nights hotel stay and all meals from dinner on Friday to lunch on Sunday), wine and refreshments over the weekend and, naturally, access to all hotel facilities including the swimming pool (I think they also have a gym). The convention is held in a **** hotel, with very nice cuisine and an always-open bar, and the above prices are (I'm told) outrageously discounted from their usual rates. (Actually, there's been some talk of additional discounts to incentivize foreign attendees, but no official confirmation from the hotel staff yet.)<br/><br/>The location is in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montecatini_Terme" rel="nofollow">Montecatini Terme</a>, Tuscany -- a nice touristic town famous for its natural hot water springs and spas, and an elegant spot for boutique shopping (or just window-shopping) -- so there's plenty to do in town besides role-playing. For some A-grade sightseeing, Firenze and Lucca are also very close by, and Pisa's not far. The hotel, btw, is located downtown and a 5' walk (at most) from the train station; if you're coming by plane, you can comfortably get there by train from either the Florence or Pisa airports.<br/><br/>In case anybody <i>would like</i> to come, please, let me know \u2014 even if there's something keeping you now, maybe we can still work something out to make the deal sweeter!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>
