It went well.<br/><br/>I was the only one who had read the hack and my players were unprimed except for my email which said "pulpy sword and planet setting. Think: buried cities, alien artifacts, cthulhu monsters, low-tech fantasy/sci-fi cross-over." I had randomly read some stuff on Blair's blog about <a href="http://planetalgol.blogspot.ie/" rel="nofollow">Algol as an OSR setting </a>. This included a useful list of 200 Algol names that we indiscriminately used for PCs, NPCs and settlements during play.<br/><br/>As fair as I see it, WoA is designed to give you an introductory paragraph, playsheets and race descriptions and off you go as per AW inventing your version of the Irridium plain (the default setting on Planet Algol) around the characters and their stories. However I printed out the set of 10 images on the right hand side of Blair's blog, arranged as a collage on a single page to give the players a visual prompt on the setting. I then told everyone that they were a gang of thieves and hence had the race Barshi men (I didn't want to have to explain a bunch of races, besides I wouldn't have been able to keep it straight myself). I then spread out the playbooks and the players picked: (at some stage I also read out the paragraph on the irridium plateau) <br/><br/>HK-74, the Robot, (hardcore deconstructionist aesthetic)+1Cool, +3 Hard, -1 Hot, +1 Sharp, -1 Weird<br/>moves: mechanical titan (mandatory, immune to many things that kill humans, don't heal harm instead need a technician), Heavy metal(+1 hard), Unstoppable (-4 on the harm move). Specialist function: energy beams (3 harm close). Aux fns: blades(3 harm hand), hardened (2 armour). Stealthy (thief move) [I didn't want to give the others a freebie and not him]<br/><br/>[Ah, I see where this is going...]<br/><br/>Zerash, the Sorcerer, Tall and imperious with an air of unshakable confidence +1 Cool, +1 Hard, -2 Hot, 0 Sharp, +2 Weird<br/>Moves: Expanded spell book, Mesmerizing power(+weird instead of hot to seduce/manipulate), Stolen Earthman specialist armour(2-armour).<br/>Spells: magic missile, light, spirit steed, open, ghostwalk, wizard eye, wall of fire<br/><br/>Thanzun, the Bravo [fighter/merc but I morphed him into a knight by accident], All smiles and scars, grizzled -1Cool, +3Hard, +1Hot, +1Sharp, -1Weird<br/>Moves: battle-hardened, bloodcrazed, veteran(+1 hard), eye for an eye<br/>Serious weapon: Magna-coil bolt-thrower specialist weapons: ceramic grenades, shotgun backup: sword<br/><br/>[Again? ]<br/><br/>We did Hx and asked some questions and came up with this:<br/><br/>Thanzun is a wandering minor noble of the house of Vulk. He once fought the house of Vaulk's enemy, Zorak the Lava-lizard king in single combat and defeated him and thus ascended to the crown of the Red stripe tribe in the borite mountains to the north of the Irridium plain. He was a poor king and cared little for his subjects and their war with the Ice lizards. There were rumours that he was to be deposed and even within the house of Vulk there were factions that said he should never have accepted the lizard's submission and instead should have wiped them out. Thus, just in time, Thanzun ("the lizard king") fled his kingdom towards the Irridium plain. While being pursued by a lizard war-party he saw HK-74 emerging from his repair facility and bunker at the edge of the mountains. HK-74 in turn was impressed with the destruction of lizards that Thanzun dealt out. HK-74 is on a reconnaissance mission to pave the way for a buried robot army that will cleanse the surface world of fleshy lifeforms. In this he serves "the controller" who waits beneath. He likes anyone or thing that is effective at starting the killing and gladly joined forces with Thanzun to wipe out any pursuing lizard-men. <br/><br/>They made it to Jashcar, a small town/hole in the ground at the edge of the Irridium plain where they met Zerash in a bar-room brawl that erupted when lizardmen assassins attempted to eliminate Thanzun. Zerash proved his worth when he eliminated the would-be assassin. He thought that these 2 could be of some use to him, especially since he was already looking for some muscle to pad out the expenses on a simple arcane scavenging job/killing he had planned. The mark was one Bodrept who was willing to pay highly to be escorted to the ancient city walls that stood alone and city-less in the semi-desert nearby. Bodrept had unwisely revealed that he had an artifact that would transport them through the walls into the city itself. Unfortunately when they arrived at the city walls, the murder turned out to be harder to commit  than planned as Bodrept was an initiate of the church of starry wisdom and was met there by a train of cowled cultists who performed some strange ceremony and disappeared without paying. Three porters/escorts were sacrificed in the, including Vratal, the son of Rugr, Eldritch Rex of Jashcar.<br/><br/>Dumped in the semi-desert, the three PCs wandered back towards Jashcar in desperate need of supplies. While in the desert they encountered the IIyx raiders, a bandit gang, who were intent on robbing and enslaving them. Here HK-74 learnt that Zerash could also be of great use in the struggle against meat as the sorcerer infiltrated the Ilyx camp and used their altar to magnify his powers such that he could cause a huge firestorm that engulfed 90% of the tribe. The PCs escaped but there were certainly Ilyx survivors too...<br/>On their return to Jashcar, Rugr imprisoned the players for the insolence of letting his son die at the hands of the cultists. When HK-74 tried to eliminate Rugar, his shaman Orek caused HK-74 to "turn off". The time lost to HK-74 is unknown to him but eventually the three surrendered their remaining wealth and manged to bribe their way out of Jashcar, never to return on pain of death. HK-74 does not consider credible the meat-packets delusion that he was vulnerable to anything. His respect for Zerash is tinged with confusion as he sees Zerash manipulate the nanites to perform his "spells" but he does not believe in the way-out "magical" explanations Zerash continues to give. Perhaps he can educate Zerash over time?<br/><br/>Thus, on the run from Jershan, the party have made their way down the river Pox, towards the centre of the Irridium plateau. En route they met more bandits or thieves - Prangs's gang. After an uneasy truce, Thanzun stole a crystal communicator from Prang's personal hoard and the party escaped at night. They have just arrived in the more wealthy town of Vorka, which is run for and by a merchant council of the five richest citizens. They are staying at the Green Griffin  up-market Inn near the great market. Thanzun has spun a tale about his lizard kingdom and managed to secure free board. He is wooing Krisk, the naive daughter of Frung one of the 5 merchant councilors (he thinks this is a way to easy loot). Frung wants Thanzun to stay a million miles away from his daughter. Zerash is an old acquaintance of Frung having done some work for him in the past. HK-74 has got in to trouble with the town enforcers, killing one of the secret police known as the black watch last night. He wanders the streets at night having no-where to stay and no need to sleep. Thanzun and Krisk are preparing for a gala ball to be held next week. Prince Prangle of Jashcar will be the guest of honor. Frung has provided Zerash with an invitation to the ball and hinted that he once again needs his services. No-one knows what the robot will do...<br/><br/>We'll find out tomorrow night!                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_399633">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/399633/#Comment_399633" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-12-04T21:18:38+00:00" title="December  4, 2012  9:18PM">December 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 4, 2012 9:19PM by Paul_T.">edited December 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there a new/up-to-date version of World of Algol?

Unfortunately only time for short notes so here goes:<br/><br/>HK-74 spotted some of Prangs's gang obviously hunting the market area for news of the PCs, he went back to get reinforcements (why?) in the form of Thanzun. They both marched down to the market and confronted the poor bandits. This resulted in several bloodied bandits and a scene outside Frung the merchant's establishment. Frung was even more pissed of with  Thanzun. Then the local enforcers arrived - hide armour and repeating crossbows - they let the king (Thanzun) go free (to try and reason with Frung, no deal, the king don't talk, he threaten good). However the enforcers wanted HK-74 to go downtown with them. The robot didn't explode and bizarrely went with them. Downtown the sgt made it clear that they knew what happened the other night and that HK-74's abilities had been recognized and they wanted him on-side and were willing to pay.  It turned out that another of the 5 Merchants that run the town (Azor) was interested in employing HK as a special guard since he had an intuition that something was going to go down at his (wizard) tower. Information on Agog was what HK wanted, along with a potfull of gold. He was assured it would be a short mission and only a minor ritual had to be performed to enforce the contract. HK was convinced that this was mere  showmanship (but it wasn't). [He failed a manipulate and had it turned back on him.] <br/><br/>Meanwhile Frung had re-contacted Zerash and offered him a casket that would allow him to control the demon Kalumb who would fight with the strength of 100 men for a little job. There was this wizard's tower that he wanted him to break into ...<br/>Zeresh was so delighted that he got a bowl of gems too (in advance, the casket was on completion), he reckoned he had an inside man.<br/><br/>Turned out the magical binding was affecting HK-74s programming and there was no way he could do anything but guard that tower each night. Zerash and Thanzun decided they couldn't trust HK to turn the other way, so cooked up a plan to pocket the gems and break into Frung's place instead (the big party was tonight and would be a great cover). Then Zerash opened his brain and visited the spirit plane to gain guidance. Zeresh described  this as a sandy plain across which his spirit guide came to meet him and offer advice. When things were bad there were more hills or even mountains.  I told him that there were low hills tonight and all the sand was shifting in hypnotic patterns, when the spirit guide appeared he pointed to the night sky in which the stars shifted in front of Zerash's eyes and then aligned. At that point Zerash felt himself being projected through space to the location of the outer gods dancing and then the central figure dissolved into Freung's laughing head [fade to black]. Zerash declared that fing with  Frung was not on and they'd have to go back to plan A, breaking into the tower and burning the library in the basement (as Frung desired). <br/><br/>Cut to party with HK at the tower on guard. Zerash and Thanzun made their presence known, found out that Azor the wizard was going to put on a firework show and then slipped out to the tower. They bumped into some enforcers en route to the tower but bluffed their wat through. Thanzun went to distract HK-74 by talking to him [interfering] and Zerash made himself into a ghost form and slipped into the tower (realising that he had only memorised this once and thus if he became substantial in there he's have no way of getting out...). Once in the basement he easily detects movement in the floor above, a crude tripwire to an alarm bell and a trapdoor. The room was packed with shelves and boxes full of fairly humdrum arcana. <br/><br/>Outside Azor came out the main door, dropped some fireworks and Thanzun helped him over to the party gaining some clues that he was a fairly nice guy (for someone at the top of a bloody heap) and Frung's daughters weren't all genetic daughters, plus he was corrupted by something, probably eldritch, especially of late.<br/><br/>Zerash used his wizard eye spell to explore the space beyond the trapdoor. It led to a glowing cavern with a single tunnel leading down. That eventually ended up in an underground maze that the eye found a way to escape from and follow another tunnel to a large, closed high-tech blast door. Zeresh once again visited the spirit plane [open brain] to see the foothills higher, the sands still shifting hypnotically and then parting to reveal millions of HK-74 robots laid out like the terracotta army surrounding a black pyramid, which was inhabited by another aspect of Azathoth ....weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!<br/><br/>Zerash burned the library/storeroom, decided that HK-74 must never learn of this tunnel, escaped from the birning tower. HK-74 managed to save the tower from burning down but alas the cellar was beyond saving.<br/>Zerash has just made it back to the party to RV with Thanzun but the Prince of Jashcar has also just arrived and recognized Thanzun, upon which he turns to him with an extended finger "YOU!".[We cut there] <br/><br/>Nice. I predict we won't need 6 sessions! Zerash has got his first advance, I think the others are close.<br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
