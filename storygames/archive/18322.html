(I\u2019m not saying that AW is unique in this respect.) Everything you need to know about your character is contained on the sheet.<br/><br/>I just found <i>Dungeon World</i> and from there devoured AW. I\u2019ve also got other exciting bits like <i>Monsterhearts</i> and <i>Monster of the Week</i> in the queue. I expect it to be fun.<br/><br/><i>However</i>.<br/><br/>I have a long running campaign setting that involves magic and technology and weird races and all kinds of crazy bat-shit kitchen sink bullshit. (<i>Rifts</i> in Space would not be the wrong way to describe it.) My players, and more importantly, I am/are incredibly invested in the setting. Once my players get into the system (I am reasonably confident they will do so), we\u2019ll want to shift gears to my setting. And so I\u2019ve started thinking about custom playbooks, taking into account a lot of the great design advice I\u2019ve gotten from here and other threads.<br/><br/><i>However</i>.<br/><br/>My players are big fans of the word \u201cbut.\u201d I want to play a guy like this <i>but</i> I want to have that. I want to play a badass dame who can do this <i>but</i> has that. I want to be a cross between this and that <i>but</i> with undertones of this other thing.<br/><br/>Creating \u201carchetypes\u201d for them is going to be a disaster of custom moves. They\u2019ll love the <i>Starship Captain</i> class I created, but wonder why they can\u2019t also have a magic tattoo. They\u2019ll look at the <i>golemancer</i> class and say \u201cFuck yes, <i>but</i> I want cyborg eyes.\u201d<br/><br/>So, I\u2019ve started with tinkering with the idea of hybrid classes, akin to <i>Legend</i> or <i>Danger Patrol</i> (h/t Johnstone). For those not familiar, \u201cclasses\u201d are made up of modular parts. In Legend, for example, a barbarian is actually a hybrid of three classes, and if you want to be 2/3 barbarian and 1/3 monk, you just swap out any given modular part of the barbarian for any part of the monk.<br/><br/>And I\u2019m curious \u2013 how would you design a character sheet, or like a character sheet designed, that would incorporate moves from more than one source? Imagine if you could only choose moves from DW\u2019s Compendium Classes. If you have more sources for moves, the AW playbook design begins to strain. Is there any other option than the traditional blank character sheet write-in-your-own-moves option, with three pages of spells/moves stapled behind it?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_413056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/413056/#Comment_413056" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2013-04-29T10:08:53+00:00" title="April 29, 2013 10:08AM">April 2013</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            One thing I've seen discussed a bunch is using cards to write down important character features like moves.<br/><br/>If you have a "deck" of Fighter moves and a "deck" of psychic maelstrom moves, you can pick a certain combination of cards to represent your character's abilities.<br/><br/>I don't know of anyone who's actually turned this into any kind of finished product, though.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
