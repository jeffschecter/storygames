He has a pile of in-development games that he would like to draw attention to and find playtesters for, and is discouraged by the prospect of having to create yet more games in order to cultivate attention for his work.<br/><br/>Are they any RPG design contests for unpublished, unfinished but not entirely new games?<br/><br/>If not, why not? Do most game design competitions ask you to create an entirely new game just to promote fairness, or are there other reasons?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311518">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis" title="DanielSolis"><img alt="DanielSolis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2716/4357538387_5385eb52cd_o.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanielSolis">DanielSolis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311518/#Comment_311518" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T13:06:41+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  1:06PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            To your first question, <a href="http://www.thousandyeargame.com/" rel="nofollow">The Thousand-Year Game Design Challenge</a> is open to any unpublished game. It doesn't need to be made from scratch, just unpublished before submission. I'm curious how an RPG designer would approach this challenge.<br/><br/>To your second question, I decided <i>against</i> a from-scratch restriction for this challenge. As you said, I figured a lot of people already had ideas for games that would be eligible, but had no major incentive to polish them up into a final form. I didn't want to exclude those designers, so I left the challenge open to them.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311523">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311523/#Comment_311523" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T13:36:00+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  1:36PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As a sidenote, Game Chef didn't require you to start from scratch -- at least, ideas wise -- this past year; it merely required that to start writing your submission from scratch.

I think part of the problem is that finishing games is a lot harder than starting them, so it would be hard to find a critical mass of people who are serious enough about finishing to all participate in something simultaneously. Another barrier is that it's a lot easier to look at the "contest games" people produce without the kind of investment that it usually takes to look at a "real game", since they tend to be longer and can't just rely on single stark ideas. I think there's room for more types of design contests than the ones we've got, but there are some structural barriers that would have to be overcome to make them happen.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_311582">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311582/#Comment_311582" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-07T21:41:25+00:00" title="February  7, 2011  9:41PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I think the other issue is that, for a lot of people, once you're committed to the design, it doesn't matter if there's a contest: you're going to finish it.

It seems to me that the most important feature of contests for in progress games isn't about the prize, but rather has proved to be that they set a deadline for completion.

I think the vast majority of people who start games don't finish them or, at least, are waiting for the time and opportunity to get around to finishing them, which isn't necessarily just around the corner.  Even folks like Vincent haven't finished a majority of their outstanding projects (Red Sky AM, Storming the Wizard's Tower, Space Tyrant, etc.).  How many games have been submitted to contests? How many of them have ever been "finished"?  That's a lot of outstanding projects, and while none of them necessarily "deserve" to be finished (thinking about outstanding projects that way is kinda poisonous, in my experience), I'm sure a fair number of folks would love the chance to really bear down and get something to a "done" state.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_311662">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ndp" title="ndp"><img alt="ndp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/386/nYH674YV48BEA.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ndp">ndp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/311662/#Comment_311662" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-08T09:10:23+00:00" title="February  8, 2011  9:10AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Is there any reason not to do a self-directed 24 hr RPG challenge with the goal of "finish this existing game in 24 hours"?

Like, if I sat down to write Lady Blackbird, that PDF is it. Lady Blackbird is pretty much the definition of "polished PDF" to me, it's also a finished game.<br/><br/>There's two issues: when a game is finished, and when you're committed to finishing. Some stuff, I realized it's just going to be a PDF, then drive to that PDF (Old Mesilla, for ex.). Other things, I realized there's something more, and drive to that. (Disclaimer: I haven't actually hit that yet. This year.)<br/><br/>I think clearly defining both of those is important, but that's a whole 'nother discussion.<br/><br/>I totally buy the value of feedback and deadline setting. I'm just not as set on calling that a "contest." I mean, if we all hang around and help each other through a new draft of our games and share feedback, that's great! But do we really need to make it a contest? Maybe I'm reading too much into it being a contest, but to me that sounds like picking the best one and winners and categories and such. I mean, until I read Lester's post, I thought of the Lark as more like applying for a grant, not like Game Chef.<br/><br/><b>Edit:</b> And, having looked at Flawless Victory, that's pretty much what I was thinking (I might have pushed for some kind of community review, like to actually be a "winner" you have to also give feedback on someone else's project). Public deadline setting, pushing yourself, and taking accountability are all awesome!

It involves a lot of speculation, positioning by comparing it to games you HAVE played that might not actually be like the game in design at all, and some projection from the reader in terms of what they think the designer should be designing rather than the game's actual rules, fun, playability, etc. I don't want to discourage such a cool community thing, but I do want to encourage actual playing in addition to talking about the games, and if you do just talk about the game keep the designer's goals foremost in your mind rather than turning the game into the game you wish you were designing but aren't. And designers, have a vision of your design and don't be swayed. And from my own experience, it is a lack of playtesting that has killed more of my half-finished designs than anything else.<br/><br/>Right now I have two games I'm developing. One took nearly three years of development to complete. The other has gone from random idea to nearly-polished game at a speed so rapid that I'm startled - about a month. The difference? The former I had a difficult time playtesting. The second hit the ground running as far as playtests go and has external playtesters who have played the game more than I have. Discussion has helped me to get through certain thorny problems or roadblocks, but it's the playtesting that has actually moved the game closer to completion.<br/><br/>I am not trying to poo-poo this endeavor, but since I am standing right now on the edge of going from endless, perpetual development to actual publication and being able to see with hindsight and comparison to another game I have in development, I wanted to throw this out there. I realize that talking about a game is a much easier contribution to make to a game's development than a playtest, but I think doing external playtesting is the most significant single contribution one could make to the development of a game.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton" title="J_Walton"><img alt="J_Walton" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/668/nW926LVRPNCFE.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J_Walton">J_Walton</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312551/#Comment_312551" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T17:23:57+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  5:23PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Bret has a super great point.

I'm not sure about Dan.<br/><br/>I agree that playtesting is hugely important, and should definitely be encouraged. However, I do think that the kind of critiques being offered here--even without playtesting--are potentially very valuable, because they create a dialogue about a title that previously wasn't attracting much thought or attention beyond the designer and his/her group/clique. This could encourage others to join the discussion, and, yes, playtest the game. So, even if the opinion offered about the game initially don't prove particularly valuable to the designer, the fact that the discussion exists at all could be beneficial.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312560">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak" title="DanMaruschak"><img alt="DanMaruschak" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DanMaruschak">DanMaruschak</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312560/#Comment_312560" name="Item_29" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T18:02:31+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  6:02PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I agree that playtesting is important, but it's a lot easier to promise feedback than to promise playtesting since playtesting requires getting a commitment from an entire group of people rather than an individual. Lets make sure we don't make the perfect the enemy of the good. Everyone who's posted stuff on Sage's model so far has included at least the possibility of doing some playtesting. If someone asks me for feedback on a game that looks cool I'll definitely make an effort to test it, but I never promise anything I'm not confident I can deliver so I won't promise ahead of time that testing will occur.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_312576">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/sage" title="sage"><img alt="sage" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.latorra.org/images/SPIcon.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/sage">sage</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312576/#Comment_312576" name="Item_30" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-14T19:33:33+00:00" title="February 14, 2011  7:33PM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Brett, of course you're right. But I'm not trying to replace actual play, or keep people from getting actual play. If anything, I'm promoting actual play.<br/><br/>That said, there is value in reading and thinking about a text without play. It shouldn't override what you find out in play ("Oh, that totally works in play" is a valid response to a concern), but it is useful.<br/><br/>Some background: every Tuesday I get to hang out with a great group of gamers with game design leanings. That includes J-Walt, actually. The number of things that I've figured out from just talking about my games with those people is enormous. Now, I realize I'm lucky to have that, so I want to offer what I can of that experience to other people. I may not be able to literally sit down and have a beer with you a trade ideas, but I can try to bottle the same thing up in an email.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_312624">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis" title="George_Cotronis"><img alt="George_Cotronis" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/565/n86K6YUHZ386G.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/George_Cotronis">George_Cotronis</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/312624/#Comment_312624" name="Item_31" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-02-15T07:21:31+00:00" title="February 15, 2011  7:21AM">February 2011</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Frankly, AP has been nothing but useless for me.
