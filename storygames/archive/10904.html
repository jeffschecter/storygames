I'm wanting to fire up a game on Google Wave and considering a number of them: A Dirty World, Mouse Guard, Traveller, Shock:, Apocalypse World, Trail of Cthulhu, Contenders, etc. Are some games better suited to the pace of PbW, where you can't guarantee real-time interaction, as in a more traditional table-top experience? Are some games unsuited to it? Example: I play Danger Patrol in a high-energy, high-interaction kind of way that would suffer via PbW. Combat-heavy or high action games might suffer as well. More literary, mystery, investigation, social interaction games might fare better. Or so I'm wondering.

Contenders might be a bit of a nightmare, if your players only get on Wave once a day (or *ahem* FAR less than that *ahem*). You'll need a week just to get through a five-round bout. Then again, you can run turns in parallel, when folks have "simple" scenes like Work or training, so you can get through a round of scenes fairly efficiently (again: until a bout).<br/><br/>Heavy dialog will interfere, too, because of the lag between each line. In our Fiasco game, I am going to try to encourage more of an intent + tone approach to narrating dialog, in the hopes that we can wrap an exchange in days, not weeks. Third-person narration of a whole approach to a conversation, rather than line-by-line exchanges. Then again... some scene might just have to be done line-by-line, for proper build up and effect... and so patience will be key.<br/><br/>Main Advice: Pick a game that ALL of the players are REALLY passionate about... or it will stagnate and stall and eventually die for lack of traffic. I'd say motivation to play is five to ten times more important than relative speed of play or suitability to asynchronous play.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
