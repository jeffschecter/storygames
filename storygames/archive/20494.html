The remaining three had been re-acquired by Sauron and were held in Mordor, probably in Barad-d\xfbr.<br/><br/>Nothing is said in canon about the ultimate fate of the Nine given to Men upon the destruction of the Nazg\xfbl. It's not even entirely clear whether the Nazg\xfbl wore them, or whether Sauron kept them in Mordor. If they were worn, then they would presumably be wherever the wearer was when it fell. The Witch-King fell at Pelennor Fields. The other eight were at the Battle of the Black Gates, and were rushing toward Mount Doom when the One Ring was deatroyed (and Sauron, and apparently the Nazg\xfbl, with it). So, if these rings were not destroyed when the One Ring was destroyed, they might have tumbled to earth somewhere in Mordor between the Black Gates and Mount Doom.<br/><br/>If they weren't actually worn by the Nazg\xfbl, they're probably in Barad-d\xfbr, along with the three remaining rings of the Dwarves.<br/><br/>In either event, the rings are likely to be found sooner or later by the Gondorian armies and colonists that will presumably sweep into Mordor and make it civilized, or their descendants.<br/><br/>As for the remaining rings' power: the way I see it, there are three ways you could go. Either:<br/><br/>1. They lose their power completely when the One Ring is destroyed. This is probably what Tolkien intended. Or:<br/><br/>2. They retain some residual power. The possessor of one of these rings would have some minor sorcerous abilty and would be corrupted to evil, but would not be able to approach the Nazg\xfbl's power. This is a reasonably Tolkien-ish outcome, and provides lots of adventure opportunities without ramping the conflict up to LotR levels. Or, finally:<br/><br/>3. They remain at full strength, but no longer subject to the control of the One Ring. This seems to me to be the best option for high-stakes adventuring in the Fourth Age. It's broadly consistent with the letter of the text, if not its tone. Gandalf never seemed to be especially worried about the fate of any of the rings except the One Ring\u2014but there were limits to Gandalf's knowledge of the rings' power and nature. This option would make for an especially grim surprise, because it means facing down a new generation of sorcerers who could rival the Nazg\xfbl in power, but who are not controlled by Sauron and can act autonomously.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450460">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/creases" title="creases"><img alt="creases" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/creases">creases</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450460/#Comment_450460" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-07T19:32:17+00:00" title="January  7, 2016  7:32PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 7, 2016 7:35PM by creases.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            All of that said: Tolkien also toyed with the idea of a sequel to LotR that would revolve around the growth of a new secret cult of Morgoth in Fourth-Age Gondor.

I've been thinking about it along these lines since I started this post.<br/><br/>A quick look at the books shows that there are a few lines like (not verbatim), "The Witch-King's cry faded and was never heard again <i>in this Age</i>[...]" (emphasis mine).<br/><br/>Likewise, even Sauron is described vaguely as a shadow which rose into the sky and was blown away by the wind... (it's really not terribly clear whether this means destruction or a retreat). (Although perhaps there is more about this elsewhere in the legendarium?)<br/><br/>It seems believable to me that Tolkien was leaving some room for a "sequel", or, at least, believable enough for our purposes. <br/><br/>creases, of your options above, I like the second. It's very Tolkienesque and appropriate - it's right that, in Middle-Earth, the villains of the present are ever weaker than those of the past, mere shadows of them; but it is balanced by the fading of the heroes, as well. Eowyn, badass as she is, is no Glorfindel or Gandalf or Galadriel, but will have to deal with evil as a Woman, not an immortal being of power.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450505">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul88" title="Paul88"><img alt="Paul88" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/053/nWQZSY26H1EHE.JPG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul88">Paul88</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450505/#Comment_450505" name="Item_19" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-09T10:10:40+00:00" title="January  9, 2016 10:10AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2016 10:11AM by Paul88.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            On recovering a ring of power would she not be tempted by corruption?<br/>Maybe there could be relics to help protect her which she could adventure for or advice she must first seek.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450506">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450506/#Comment_450506" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-09T11:38:52+00:00" title="January  9, 2016 11:38AM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 9, 2016 11:41AM by David_Berg.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>On recovering a ring of power would she not be tempted by corruption?<br/>Maybe there could be relics to help protect her which she could adventure for or advice she must first seek.</blockquote>\nOoh, I like that idea!

He may hear Witch-kings whisper in his dreams, he hears echoes of his death-cry and sees ring of fire in front of him in broad daylight. He may settled in one of old Mordor fortresses on borders with Ithilien (either Minas Morgul against the ban of the King or for example Durthang) and became a tyrant, leader of evil men and raider. Powers of Ring are now unchanneled (without the evil will that focused them) and fuel him with strenght and torture him in the same time.<br/><br/>\xc9owyn estabilished connection with Witch-king in moment when she killed him as well... and so both she and main antagonist share some kind of bond, may see each other in their dreams or sense something from the other.<br/><br/>I imagine start of campaign when Faramir and most of men are gone to war alongside King and only \xc9owyn stays home in their home in Emyn Arnen with their small son Elboron, few servants and maids. They woke her in the middle of night because they have seen the light of nearby village burning against night sky. Raiders and main antagonist are coming to kill them. She takes sword, ready to defend her home and family against all evil. I imagine her bitter laughter as ring of steel in this dark hour, because she is not defeated yet, for she is the Lady of the Shield-arm, the White Lady of Rohan and Dernhelm still.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_450531">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450531/#Comment_450531" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-10T18:47:28+00:00" title="January 10, 2016  6:47PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 10, 2016 6:52PM by Paul_T.">edited January 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            That's beautiful! I love it.<br/><br/>Here's my own idea (which came to mind before I started this thread, and, as you will see, aligns quite coincidentally with some of the ideas posted here):<br/><br/>Sometime after the events of the War of the Ring, Eowyn finds herself haunted by dreams where she is desperately searching through the desolate wastes of the battle of Minas Tirith. In the dreams, she is looking for something, turning over the remains of the dead, scrabbling in the earth...<br/><br/>One night, unable to sleep, she wanders out into the garden. There she meets an apparition: an aged, noble, ancient, bearded man. He explains to her that he has long departed this world but seeks her aid.<br/><br/>He tells her that he is unable to enter the afterlife and he believes it is because he has been given a purpose. Someone or something has been at the battlefield and taken something from the place where the Witch-King fell in battle. He worries that this could be ill news - perhaps someone wishes to revive the Witch-King, or draw on some fell sorcery?<br/><br/>He beseeches her to find this person and stop them from whatever it is they are doing. As a ghost, he will accompany her and may be able to lend her his lore and wisdom, as well as guiding her towards their quarry, who appears to be heading South. There is not much time to spare!<br/><br/>(The player has indicated that she would like Eowyn to be send on a quest or adventure, so this is what I came up with.)<br/><br/>Possible Twist: The ghostly apparition guiding Eowyn could be, in fact, the shade of the Witch-King, hoping to get his hands on the Ring. (He may not know if it is the Ring which is being carried or not.)<br/><br/>Possible Twist #2: The Witch-King, no longer bound by Sauron's influence, can be redeemed!<br/><br/><br/>I'm still a little shocked at how close this is to some of the suggestions in this thread!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_450533">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/450533/#Comment_450533" name="Item_28" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-01-10T19:27:22+00:00" title="January 10, 2016  7:27PM">January 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Themes?

If we're playing the angle of "The Ghost is the Witch King" then it seems possible that he is still Cursed by his Ring.
