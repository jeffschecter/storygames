Breaking/altering/throwing out rules changes the game, making it, effectively, A Different Game, but it's not reliable (in my experience).<br/>\n<br/>\nNow, if a game is up-front about what's supposed to be fun about it, and the rules are About that fun (that is, they not only <i>allow</i> it to happen, but <i>actively cause it to happen</i> when followed properly) to the point that you never need to break them, well, that's what I call a pretty damned good game.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd, by the way:<br/>\nFor my money, that's what we need rules for <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/>\n<br/>\n-Marshall                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144469">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144469/#Comment_144469" name="Item_14" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T11:27:25+00:00" title="May 16, 2008 11:27AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Jesse</cite>For what it's worth, I consider any formal instruction to be a "rule."<br><br>In Spione it explicitly says that the purpose of Maneuvers is to put the Spy into The Cold where The Cold is defined as putting the spy at odds with his home agency.<br><br>I consider that a rule even though it's purely a creative mandate to the players.<br/></br></br></br></br></blockquote>\nAh, ok, that's a bit of what I was thinking of as a not-rule procedure                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144482">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Tristan" title="Tristan"><img alt="Tristan" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Tristan">Tristan</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144482/#Comment_144482" name="Item_15" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T11:55:34+00:00" title="May 16, 2008 11:55AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: merb101</cite>I've had long arguments with people when playing rpgs, board games, card games... i refer to the rules constantly until i get them in my head.

My response is always the same: "If we don't follow the rules, what's the point in playing?"</blockquote>\nMy insight. Rules are not for fun. They are to make the game fair for anyone (at least anyone agreeing with those rules). Somehow it has to do with the Ethos of having someone else tell you you can or can't do something... If a rulebook or mediator tells me I can't do something, somehow it seems more valid than if the one who would be affected by me doing that tells me so. (I take the Cops and Robbers classical example. "I hit you." "You did not!" "I did!" "You did not!" And then everyone is unhappy and consensus can't be reached. ^_^)<br><br>And in theory those rules are supposed to make the game fun for everyone. In theory... Some rules you might like, some rules might make the game more fun or less fun. And <i>then</i> the advise would be to try to find a game whose rules make it fun for you.<br><br>So rules are for maintaining fairness and order in the game.

They suppress conduct that is undersirable (don't kill people).<br><br>Some rules are constitutive.  They enable something that could not exist without the rule (corporations law permits the creation of "artificial persons" to act as vehicles of limited liability investment etc., condominium law makes "parcels of air" in to real estate, etc.).<br><br/>Many rules have elements of both of these - the first still-intact legal code in history stated that it was not acceptable for a member of the upper class to beat a member of the lower class for refusing to sell them something at the price offered by upper classer.  This is both part of suppressing coercive conduct amounting to theft and also part of creating a free market.<br/><br/>A game's rules suppress conduct that is not determined to be valid in the game.  This is usually because "it would be less fair, less fun".  The rules of some sports are adjusted, for example, to "increase the fun" (e.g., the fastplay version of cricket that is gaining popularity world wide).  It is more fun if the rules say there is some risk of my intent not coming to pass (as this creates tension and uncertainty, anticipation etc.).<br/><br/>A game's rules constitute things to be then pursued.  Just as some law creates forms of property a rule defines an advantage or benefit, some "cookie" that play pursues.  Magic items, experience, gold, "points towards the next advance".  Various designers have noted that "people love any kind of currency/counter, create something that allows they to rack up some kind of points and that alone can increase their enjoyment".  Baseball constitutes "bases" to progress around for example, where "gains are made but not yet solidified".  That "increments towards success that can still be lost" element is common in many games and sports for it permits a feeling of progress, the tension of win/loss, and continues it as "it ain't over till it's over".<br/><br/>Rob                        </br></br></br></br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_144486">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ry" title="Ry"><img alt="Ry" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/068/nG8VFF5KAMJET.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ry">Ry</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144486/#Comment_144486" name="Item_17" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-16T12:09:55+00:00" title="May 16, 2008 12:09PM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Prohibitive rules tend to take me out of the flow of the game.

For instance, a good set of rules can guarantee that no one person dominates the game. <br/>--Help resolve conflicts between players<br/>--Help resolve conflicts or even just creative differences/discussions, etc, _quickly_ (i.e. help everyone save some time--for example, a vote can help a group decide _which_ game to play on a given night than just sitting around and arguing about it)<br/>--Help create dynamics, either within the story, or between the players, consistently (a given group may not be able to create a thrilling moral dilemma every time; a certain set of rules may exist that can help them achieve it more consistently)<br/>--Establish fair ground for competition (without it, some forms of enjoyable competition are impossible--just imagine playing chess without having rules for where and how certain pieces can move)<br/>--Push people to do things they're not normally comfortable with (but may still enjoy and want).

But you mention that your troupe was all people who had acted before. Problem is, what if you try to do the same thing with a different set of people? I think that's where formal rules become really important. I'm thinking now that that's the main issue: portability, and the ability to inform Social Contract and mandate Techniques.<br/><br/>Someone who invents a game can probably play that game with their group to their heart's content without ever writing down a rule, if the group is intimate enough.

I really do understand where people are coming from and for the most part agree.

How are they supposed to know what to do?<br/><br/>That said, I've played freeform tabletop games were people just riffed off the background and each other. With the right people, i.e. those who know what to expect and how to play unsafe, this works really well. But even if you don't have explicit rules , there is an older deeper magic that controls the game. Things like narrative consistency, closure, reincorporation, doing the obvious, not blocking. These aren't rules as such, there's no in game penalty for breaking them (because there are no rules), except that perhaps the other players won't talk to you much if you do. If you've been sent to Coventry you can't join in, play, so it's not in your interest to do so.<br/><br/>There's a balance to be struck between bringing in new ideas and developing old ones, between change and status quo. The groups that can address these issues without recourse to explicit rules are likely to have a stimulating time.<br/><br/>Which is not to say that rules are bad. Rules encourage a certain kind of play. If you want to give that kind of guiding hand, then that's interesting to explore too. There are always some parameters to play and it's fun to play with them.<br/><br/>To the address the issue of how freeform can be a game, there are several things up for grabs in the game:<br/>- status<br/>- narrative control<br/>- narrative function<br/>- creation of conflicts<br/>- closure of conflicts (or not)<br/>- performance<br/>- persuasion<br/>- creative input<br/>- etc...<br/>Players compete for or with these aspects of the game. I'd agree that it's not a game if your doing this on your own but as soon as there's somebody else just the fact that you don't have direct access to their inner mental states creates a space to explore, playfully.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_144655">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/144655/#Comment_144655" name="Item_34" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2008-05-17T09:27:36+00:00" title="May 17, 2008  9:27AM">May 2008</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You don't have to have rules.
