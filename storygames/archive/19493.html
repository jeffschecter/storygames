(tentative name)</i> is a game I've been trying, testing and refining with my friends for a while and now, finally, I think it's reached a point where I can share it with the community.<br/><br/>My main goal with this game is to create an experience of exploration through storytelling. All of this in the setting of a post-apocalyptic world. The world and characters are created and discovered through play, and everyone is a part of the experience, since this game is GM-less (or, GM-full, depending on how you see it).<br/><br/>I post this "Beta" version of the rule set, which at the moments is roughly 3 pages long, with the intention smoothing the rough edges and making this something everyone can enjoy, for this I ask you, yes you in front of your computer, to play test the heck out of this system, make comments, suggestions and death threats (wait, what?) as you see fit to help me make this into a beautiful game.<br/><br/>The Character Sheet will be added shortly, but it really only consists of the three sections described in the text.<br/><br/>I hope you guys like and have fun with my little attempt at a gaming system, I haven't been around the forum much for a while, but rest assured, I lurk here every once in a while, watching every single one of you in your sleep... creepy music and stuff.<br/><br/>Thank you all in advance!

The only game I've come upon that really explores the fiction is <b>Polaris</b>, and possibly <b>Fiasco</b>. The effect of exploring the story were more present in Polaris because I had no idea where the story would go, even though the goals are the same in both games (it will all go to hell). I think it's the drives in Fiasco who made the game be less exploration and more establishment, combined with the fact that you make up most of the stuff. Polaris got rotating GM, which makes the social contingency more apparent, and all you got to start with is some setting elements.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see what you've made.<br/><br/>I also like the halftone better.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433695">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol" title="Lisa Padol"><img alt="Lisa Padol" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Lisa%20Padol">Lisa Padol</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433695/#Comment_433695" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-11T07:34:36+00:00" title="June 11, 2014  7:34AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Sounds like the larp Resonance, which I've not played, but it does some interesting things.

I might have missed some late changes, because I downloaded the document two days ago. For some reason, I don't like reading GDocs. You don't have to answer everything because, now when I read it through, I realize that the post is rather lengthy. I mostly want to share my experience from similar games, my analyze of those game, what I learned by playing them, and ideas to develop their designs.<br/><br/>The character development in your game was what I thought was the most interesting part.<br/><br/><b>Setting Up the Game</b><br/>The question about genre is good, but I kind of miss inspirational input from the game when it comes to creating the setting. If I can imagine anything, nothing will come to me, while limitations creates inspiration. Provide a list of questions, suggestions of general ideas to spark ideas (feelings, major events), or a structure of which the input from the players is turned into something else (you do this Character Creation. An apparent occupation -&gt; Who Am I).<br/><br/><b>Question of the Day</b><br/>I like The Question of the Day. Many collaborative games tend to sprawl in all kinds of directions, so you need something to keep everyone going in the same direction. Yes, I do count games like <b>Fiasco</b>, <b>Polaris</b> and <b>Archipelago</b> into that category (but <b>Univeralis</b> is the worst). Fiasco manage to keep itself slightly from that to happen by intertwining characters with each other, but it's still a "one story per character" game. I know it's a thing in Polaris, with rotating GMs, but still. I do think <b>Zombie Cinema</b> handles itself quiet well here, because everybody strives towards the same goal - to survive - even if the means differ. The conflict mechanic that makes the game go forward also forces the characters to interact.\n<blockquote>Every time time something is at conflict, you can use dice from your pool to act,</blockquote>\nYou never said how many dice each player got to start with.\n<blockquote>You can use whichever kind of die you want with this game. /.../ decide on a method to rotate Gm periodically,</blockquote>\nI prefer when games told me how to do things, instead of leaving it up to me. If a game uses coins as resolution or clockwise rotation of the game master, then I can decide to break the rules and, for example, use dice instead of coins. I want you to sell me your idea, and when I see rules like this, it gives me the impression that the creator isn't sure about his or her own game.\n<blockquote>Advancing your character</blockquote>\nInteresting mechanic. I wonder how it turns out in play.\n<blockquote>Game Mastering</blockquote>\nI don't really get a feel of how it looks like when the game is played out. Is it played out in slow pace? What is slow pace? Should we just frame an environmental obstacle that is solved by a die roll and then move on with the next scene? Is the scene over after the conflict? What do you have in mind when writing "interesting direction"? Try to avoid buzzwords like "fun", and describe instead what is fun but also <i>why </i>it's fun. I could otherwise design a game where you roll 1d6 and then add "...and try to have fun" to make it enjoyable.\n<blockquote>When it is your turn to be the GM, just take whatever was happening before and add to it,</blockquote>\nI really like this part, and I like that you point out that the environment should be what the conflict is about, or do you mean anything in the surrounding, even humans? Anyway, pointers like that helps the game (master) going. I've played a lot of games where they say "Look at someone's drive and create a scene around it". It may sound good, but it seldom helps, because they don't give any pointers in how to think when setting up a conflict. You kind of miss this too. What creates excitement in your game? (Note: not all games needs excitement but I assumed this one would, because it's a conflict driven game.)<br/><br/>Also, I know that it's so you can save space, but nothing has happened before the starting scene, and it's hard to give nothing a spin. I understand that I should ignore "take whatever was happening before and add to it" for the very first scene, but why not make it into a thing? Let the group come up with an event that forces them to act or do like in <b>InSpectres </b>and do some dice rolls on several tables. In my first iteration of <b>This Is Pulp</b>, I had four tables that gave input to a sentence. You are [place] [in an area] when suddenly [a threat] [arrives from somewhere]. So one result could be "You are in a [city] [under water] when suddenly [machines] [comes crashing through the walls]". I'm not saying to use those kind of results, because your game is non-setting specific but the example can hopefully give spark to ideas.\n<blockquote>Change GM every time a scene is concluded, a scene is an event that takes place in one<br/>place and / or with the same characters.</blockquote>\nI usually define a scene in roleplaying games as a change in either place or time. It's somewhat similar to how scenes are thought of in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_%28film%29" rel="nofollow">movies</a>. If theater and fiction,  "a scene is a unit of drama" (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_%28drama%29" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia</a>).<br/><br/>When reading about the game master, I wonder if one game master can take over and continue from the previous scene, not changing either time or place, to make up another conflict. If that is the case, I also wonder if you shouldn't rotate the game master based on new conflicts rather than scenes. When a participant wants to create a conflict, that person becomes the game master. This is kind of initiative system is something I experimented with both in <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/tip/" rel="nofollow">This Is Pulp</a> and <a href="http://erebaltor.se/rickard/TheMurderofMrCrow_RickardElimaa.pdf" rel="nofollow">The Murder of Mr Crow</a> where the one who wants to act takes the initiative. In This Is Pulp, each player that acts gets a (initiative) token and only the ones with the least tokens gets to act. Perhaps something similar can fit this game?<br/><br/>Here's a suggestion of an initiative system for the game master. "Anyone without a token can create a conflict, and when the conflict is resolved that person must take a token. Creating a conflict also gives the power to change the place, time and who is there at the time and add things freely until another conflict takes place. Everybody looses their tokens when all participants got one. A participant may pass by taking a token." What this mechanic means is that the one who got ideas can put them into use without having to wait for his or her turn. It's the initiative maker that leads the game, instead of forcing the initiative upon someone. The token mechanism makes everyone be the game master, even if I'm not sure that is a good thing.\n<blockquote>You can pay one of your dice and earn the right to add something to the scene,</blockquote>\nWhile this can make the players understand that they can take part of the game master role, even as a player, I wonder why they can't use "Yes, and" and "Yes, but" instead, just like the game master. I would probably let the players use only "Yes, and". In improv, "Yes, and" is about building on others ideas while "Yes, but" is about blocking other ideas. "I want to go through the door". "Yes, but it's locked". In roleplaying games, "Yes, and" is still about building but "Yes, but" is instead about creating conflicts. The door is locked\u2014conflict!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>I will finally quote from the Wikipedia article about scenes as drama.\n<blockquote>Jack M. Bickham /.../ portrays a scene as having a fundamental pattern:\n<ul><li>Statement of a goal</li>\n<li>Introduction and <b>development </b>of conflict</li></ul></blockquote>\nLook at my emphasis. Development of conflict is something that's seldom handled in roleplaying games. It's usually a <i>new </i>conflict per scene, and it's a recipe that I'm so tired of these days. I looked forward playing <b>The Shab-al-Hiri Roach</b> but when I found out that it had that way of playing out scenes, my heart died a little. It's an old game, so I can forgive it. (It had dog candy rewards in it too!)<br/><br/>So consider adding an option to develop a conflict instead of purely creating new ones. Something I also miss in storytelling games is to foreshadow a conflict. To set up the criteria for a conflict; to hint that it's going to be played out in the future. Is it <i>any</i> roleplaying game that can do that? Possibly <b>Fiasco</b> and <b>Archipelago</b> but none of these games tell us how to think when it comes to sow the seeds for a conflict to be reaped later. If you want to make this more apparent in the game, let the participant remove a conflict token to create the prerequisites for a conflict.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_433760">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez" title="Omar_Ramirez"><img alt="Omar_Ramirez" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/370/nVR0Z4SVM1FWT.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Omar_Ramirez">Omar_Ramirez</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433760/#Comment_433760" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-12T13:58:47+00:00" title="June 12, 2014  1:58PM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">@BeePeeGee</a> Never heard of that, what is it? I'd like to have a look XD. Thanks for the comment!<br/><br/><a href="/forums/profile/Rickard">@Rickard</a> Thanks a lot for the indeapth analysis, I'll do my best to adress all the issues, here it goes:<br/><br/><b>Setting Up the Game</b><br/>That's fair, maybe a little more structure here would help, some examples and what not, I'll try and see what I come up with, thanks!<br/><br/><b>Question of the day</b><br/>This game can spiral out of control, yes, and the question of the day was in part thought out to be a cohesion point for everything, but at the same time, in this game in particular, having things spiral out of control is part of the intended atmosphere, This is a world you know nothing about, and thing will surprise you.<br/><br/>To give you examples of what's happened, People have found out they were instrumental in the apocalypse, or turned out to find paramilitary groups from wich they turn out to be a part of, even prostitutes on the run and stuff like that, they've found improvised cities in the subway and seen strange machines that some of them, inexplicably, know they workings of, weird mega fauna that didn't come from space but from the bottom of the earth.<br/><br/>I'd hate to have too much focus on this game because the lack of focus makes for a really engaging discovery experience.<br/><br/><b>What kind of die?</b><br/>In this one I'm not sure, maybe it is an issue of phrasing, but the reality is that even using coins works for this, since just having one die land aboce 50% value means success. I'll see what I can do about this one, any suggestions are welcome.<br/><br/><b>How many dice?</b><br/>woops, I didn't realize i didn't say, I'll check that out, you are supposed to spart out with a pool of 6 dice and your pool can never get bigger than that.<br/><br/><b>Advancing your character</b><br/>This is the real basis of the game, when you answer a question or expand on an answer about your character strange things tend to happen, you sidcover something about yourself that normally cascades into trouble for everyone. If it turns out you were the evil mastermind of big pharma, it is probable a faction that was against you is now pursuing the party, Try it, I think this one's the pivot point of the system and it has happened naturally with every group I've play tested this with.<br/><br/><b>Game Mastering</b><br/>I guess I was a little too vague there, I'll re-write it, thank!<br/><br/>About the starting sceme, and maybe I wan't clear enough with this, but the test "As you wake up in a place you don't recognize, the realization that you don't even know who you are strikes yo..." and so on is itself the starting scene. What has happened naturally in this scenario is that people jump in to fill in the blanks quickly, the first gm in turn normally sets up something that's comming (a flock of murderous birds, explosions that keep getting closer, robotic voices saying "exterminate") it very quickly become a fully flesed out scenario, but maybe I should make emphases on that.<br/><br/><b>Rotating GM</b><br/>I've actually been thinking about this on and I think i will make that call final, since I've found that it gives play a nice rhythm and pacing, since everyone at the table is different it gives the pace some predictability, this predictability is, punctuated by the other player interjecting with facts, obviously, but that's the point, thanks for pointing that out.<br/><br/>The initiative system you describes sounds cool, I'll have to try it out, but for the reasons described above, I think a fixed rotation helps define pace better.<br/><br/><b>Pay on die to add something to the scene</b><br/><br/>This mechanic's reason to be is twofold, For one it limits the number of times someone can interject, therefore making them interject only when they really want to see something come into the story that can't wait (since they will get to GM later, it doesn't really matter, they'll have a turn) or something they feel invested in. Also, this makes the players deplete their dice pool and once it is empty they can advance their characters, this makes it so that they don't just add stuff to their characters arbitrarily, but actually wait a little and add to the game before every character advancement instance.<br/><br/><b>What constutites a scene?</b><br/>I like that definition "a change in either place or time" I might work with it, What normally has happened in play test is that the next GM takes over when the GM in turn seems to have run dry of ideas for the scene, any scene normally doesn't take up more than a few minutes. This might differ from other tables, so I'll see how to work around that.<br/><br/><b>Creating seeds for new conflicts</b><br/>A cool side effect of this system is that this thing you want to happen (having a conflict evolve or just be seeded for the future) happens all the time, the questions, answers and objects you have are all seeds that, because of the chaotic nature of playing a post apocalyptic world, don't all resolve right away.<br/><br/>To give you an example of my last play test (and granted, we were being silly and wacky) here's something that happened:<br/><br/>A players starting object was a dildo, this dildo turned out to be a weapon, one that produced a lot of blades, this was just a wacky thing that we didn't really take much into account until some time later, after it was discovered that that character was the leader of a rebel coalition, it turned out the "dildo looking weapon" was the weapon of choice of this coalition.<br/><br/>This are some of the things that have happened, some pretty intense, some pretty funny and other unnerving and scary.<br/><br/>Thanks a lot for your comments, I'll keep all of this in mind and see what I can do with it.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433779">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433779/#Comment_433779" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-13T10:13:57+00:00" title="June 13, 2014 10:13AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited June 13, 2014 10:14AM by BeePeeGee.">edited June 2014</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Microscope is a GMless, dice-less RPG that is about creating a world.<br/><a href="http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.lamemage.com/microscope/</a><br/><br/>You start with a story (i.e. how did the world end?).

My own collaborative apocalypse-generating game ("<a href="http://www.rpgnow.com/product/130592/Watch-the-World-Die" rel="nofollow">Watch the World Die</a>") moves forward in time and creates a timeline of the collapse running from the pre-apocalypse to "The Great Dying".  I can imagine using WTWD (just a single roll) as a prompt for answering the question of the day.  Maybe as an option for people who feel they need a prompt, because sometimes it's gonna be fairly obvious what has to happen.  ("Oh yeah you bet your ass the recom-DNA monkeyspiders get out of the lab!")<br/><br/>I'm also intrigued by <a href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee%27s">@BeePeeGee's</a> mention of playing HDTWE in conjunction with <i>Microscope</i>.<br/><br/>Right now I'm in a campaign called "700 Horsepower" which is run by <a href="/forums/profile/SquidLord">@SquidLord</a> (Alexander Williams).  It's a hybrid mashup using <i>After the Horsemen</i> and <i>Machinas</i> for the game system(s), while the backstory and worldbuilding stuff was created collaboratively using a combination of <i>Microscope</i> and <i>Watch the World Die</i>.  Alex has uploaded the AP videos so you can see how this plays out:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5Pexz8qEs0" rel="nofollow">700 Horsepower - Watch the World Die</a><br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8tSFH5fUU8" rel="nofollow">700 Horsepower - Microscope</a><br/>(For anyone interested in joining, the G+ group is <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/115440357595297385352" rel="nofollow">here</a>.)<br/><br/>Yeah, I'm getting ahead of things a bit.

I understand that game play can generate rather bizarre things, and that's fine, but what <b>Universalis</b> does is only creating new things. It was hard to tell where the story is going, because there wasn't any structure in how to create one. This made people loose interest.<br/><br/>The character development, together with the question of the day, seems to solve that predicament in a nice way.\n<blockquote><b>What kind of die?</b><br/>In this one I'm not sure, maybe it is an issue of phrasing, but the reality is that even using coins works for this, since just having one die land aboce 50% value means success.

Unless it's the style of the game, like in <a href="http://lookrobot.co.uk/doctor-magnethands/" rel="nofollow">Dr Magnethands</a>, it's better to be specific than vague. "Use d6s" (or coins) is specific. "Use any kind of dice" isn't.\n<blockquote>What normally has happened in play test is that the next GM takes over when the GM in turn seems to have run dry of ideas for the scene,</blockquote>\nHow is the GM role handed over? "Change GM every time a scene is concluded,". Does the game master say "cut" when the scene is over? Are you using hand gestures? This should be described in the game text.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_433812">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee" title="BeePeeGee"><img alt="BeePeeGee" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/BeePeeGee">BeePeeGee</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/433812/#Comment_433812" name="Item_16" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-06-14T05:08:25+00:00" title="June 14, 2014  5:08AM">June 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<a href="/forums/profile/Asif">@Asif</a>: thanks for sharing.
