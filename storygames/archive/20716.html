Sure, you might end up in a burned out van in the wasteland, with Dremmer somewhere out there with a sniper rifle ready to kill you the minute you move an inch, but probably a lot of things had to happen and snowball to get you there, and there were a bunch of chances to have avoided this fate.<br/><br/>The second kind is the one where even if you play your character by following her moves and interacting with the common moves, Death can still reach up and yank you into an early grave. You can be doing everything right in Night Witches, getting 2-3 in the mission pool every time, and two bad rolls over a German fuel depot can result in planes falling burning into the snow and massive death all around.<br/><br/>In those games, to really survive you have to go beyond following your moves and actually push against the fiction in order to guarantee survival. In Night Witches, being in command is crucial to your survival, but then you have to balance the attention the authorities pay you against the needs of your girls. Your moves won't save you; what will save you is clever use of them.<br/><br/>I'm not sure this is a system mastery thing per se, although it does somewhat fit into that pattern.<br/><br/>As a part of my recent encounters with tone issues, I am wondering if this needs to be presented more up front. When I introduce Night Witches to people, I have started saying a version of what I wrote above, so that everyone understands that when I kill two PCs because they have a fiery wreck, that's how the game is designed to work and they should be aware of it. My problems running Sagas of the Icelanders have generally revolved around the need to make <i>really</i> hard moves in combat, and not everyone being prepared for that.<br/><br/>Here is where I see some games falling in this typology:<br/><br/>First Kind:<br/><br/>Fellowship (maybe the first AW game explicitly designed around this idea)<br/>Apocalypse World<br/>Monster of the Week<br/>Dungeon World<br/>Maybe Monsterhearts (haven't played it enough)<br/><br/>Second Kind:<br/><br/>Night Witches<br/>Sagas of the Icelanders<br/>The Warren<br/><br/>Your comments are greatly appreciated.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455088">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar" title="Jason_Morningstar"><img alt="Jason_Morningstar" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/670/nAFAIJT4NCWC8.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Jason_Morningstar">Jason_Morningstar</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455088/#Comment_455088" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-14T14:00:48+00:00" title="July 14, 2016  2:00PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's probably telling that of your <a href="/forums/search?Search=%232&amp;Mode=like">#2</a> category I designed one, published another, and play the hell out of the third.                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_455089">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix" title="Aviatrix"><img alt="Aviatrix" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/765/nILPDIVNSI4FL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Aviatrix">Aviatrix</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455089/#Comment_455089" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-14T14:20:09+00:00" title="July 14, 2016  2:20PM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Indeed, Jason, and I also like to tell people when they play SotI that having a bit of a Fiasco attitude towards the fates of the characters probably helps.*<br/><br/>* A little goes a long way--considering that when I play Fiasco, if my character hasn't killed anyone or isn't dead by the end of the second act I feel I probably wasn't playing hard enough.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_455148">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Cneph" title="Cneph"><img alt="Cneph" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Cneph">Cneph</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/455148/#Comment_455148" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2016-07-18T04:12:52+00:00" title="July 18, 2016  4:12AM">July 2016</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 18, 2016 4:24AM by Cneph.">edited July 2016</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><br/>Maybe Monsterhearts (haven't played it enough)<br/></blockquote>\nCould be. Monsterhearts, like AW and MOTW have a 'cheat death' and/or 'avoid really bad outcome mechanics' (Luck, marking debilities to stats, or losing all strings/going darkest self to avoid Death, saying "Whoa, that was his <i>4 harm shotgun</i> in my face? Of course I'd have handed over the fuel canister!"). Dungeon World has a buffer pool of HP and a Last Breath roll, but that can OFC be failed.<br/><br/>Though I own NW, I've not played it recently enough to remember whether there is anything of the kind in it? Same with the Warren and Sagas, to be fair, but I don't think there is to the same degree.<br/><br/>Is this a kind of 'movie star' genre assumption difference? You are playing sexy badasses in most of your first list, and exceptional but frail, fallible mortals in extreme situations in the others. Does a cheat death mechanic explain the differences for you, or is there more at play? Is it in the differing 'Agendas and Principles' or actual move differences you see?<br/><br/>Monsterhearts is very much a game of giving you sufficient rope to hang your hormonal, monstrous pseudo-teenage self (and a few of your most intimate frienemies and lovers) and in AW at least one of the key questions for me is to find out whether the PCs stay strong and allied against a hostile world. Which supports (requires?) a more drawn-out death spiral, rather than the random outcome of one or two misses.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>
