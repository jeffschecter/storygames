I grew up in Mexico and the only thing I knew growing up was DnD. My first games were a reaction at DnD, and by the time I arrived to the US I was so busy with my own projects (Vaxia, at the time) that I never really got into finding out what other things exist out there. <br/><br/>I don't think I speak the right lingo, or know the right names, or have played the right games. But I do have very defined ideas about what I want out of a game, and how to get it, and I tried to put those in writing for the game kickstarting now. We reached our funding goal already (the first day too, Halloween, it was a good day) but I would still like you to see it. I'm happy to have a conversation with anyone about anything. <br/><br/>The link is here: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fableforge/enter-the-shadowside-destiny" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fableforge/enter-the-shadowside-destiny</a><br/><br/>For those interested in game design I also wrote a guest post for Troll in the Corner explaining how I went from a very crunchy system in the first version of Enter the Shadowside, to DESTINY, which is the *least* crunchy I've seen. I didn't want mechanics to get in the way of the story. That article is here: <a href="http://trollitc.com/2014/11/guest-post-from-marco-leon-creator-of-enter-the-shadowside-number-crunching-my-there-and-back-again/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://trollitc.com/2014/11/guest-post-from-marco-leon-creator-of-enter-the-shadowside-number-crunching-my-there-and-back-again/</a><br/><br/>I look forward to chatting about this, or about anything else, and thank you for having me!<br/><br/>Marco                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell" title="J B Bell"><img alt="J B Bell" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/J%20B%20Bell">J B Bell</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440017/#Comment_440017" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-07T23:48:06+00:00" title="November  7, 2014 11:48PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            As someone who knows a bit of lingo, I'd like to help Marco out here. I've backed his Kickstarter, because it looks pretty neat.<br/><br/>To me the Destiny system looks like someone took Fate Accelerated, decided to use cards, then grabbed some Freeform Universal DNA. Resolution is relatively number-free. You're still doing a bit of addition and subtraction, functionally speaking, but it's no more intense than moving up and down a four-point number line, mostly. The results scale goes "yes, and; yes; yes, but; no, but; no; no, and" just like FU. One very clever bit was giving each card both a "yes, and; ... no, and" rating and a Difficulty that it can be used on. So you can use your "hard/yes" card on a hard challenge, not so hard, or easy. Your "easy/yes" card will only work for an easy challenge. This all maps prettily onto a standard playing-card deck and you could whomp one up in a few minutes with a Sharpie.<br/><br/>Conflicts are divided into arenas. In the case of Shadowside, that's Magic, Combat, Influence, and Everything Else. Those get ratings from 1-3 (I think?) and that determines how many cards are in your hand for each arena (represented by the suits). So you are strictly choosing your successes and failures, but the hand is random.<br/><br/>Skills, items, and potentially things like relationships are all basically difficulty modifiers. I like this a lot particularly, as in my own experiments with "yes, and"-type systems, I never had a good idea how to scale things except unsatisfying stuff that ends up with "yes, and, and, and . . . " The extra dimension of difficulty and its tidy representation with cards really hits it out of the park.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's thoroughly summarized in the Kickstarter text. I think there may also be a "success at a cost" mechanic. Can you comment on that, Marco? I noticed it hinted at in the reddit board.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440019">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FableForge" title="FableForge"><img alt="FableForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/648/nXJ4O51HY3RHE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FableForge">FableForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440019/#Comment_440019" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-08T03:29:02+00:00" title="November  8, 2014  3:29AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hello J B!<br/><br/>Thank you for the welcome -and everything you said it's spot-on! I call the ratings "Strong", "Average" and "Weak", but yes, they are essentially 3, 2 or 1 card. <br/><br/>I wanted to add that "Combat", "Magic" and "Influence" just happen to be the "game changers" for the particular setting of Enter the Shadowside, but if DESTINY was applied to some other setting -the example I usually go with is a High School comedy adventure- then other attributes could drive the story better, such as "Academics", "Sports" and "Popularity". If ever we wanted a Lovecraft kind of story we could go with "Lore", "Sanity" and maybe "Occult Arts"? The thinking is that we just want to cover the most frequent kinds of actions that drive our kind of story down one path or another, and leave everything else to the "Everything Else" trait, which represents some generic resourcefulness to resolve conflicts that aren't (in EtS's case) violent, magical, nor persuasive in nature. <br/><br/>"Success at a cost!" In the first edition of Enter the Shadowside we used a lot of math, and we had a separate counter called "Belief Points" -essentially a pool you could draw from whenever your rolls fell short. This came from a desire to represent mechanically one of the major themes of the setting, which is that individuals in "Hierogamy" (that is, serving as hosts to a foreign spirit) are endowed with supernatural foresight and know, to some degree, when they're going to succeed and when they're going to fail. In the new edition we represent that knowledge implicitly just by holding the cards in our hands, so the concept of Belief Points didn't have to carry over (and I was glad to cut out yet another mechanic; my general policy for EtS being that less-is-more).<br/><br/>What we *do* have, however, are Aces. Belief Points were a desirable reward StoryHosts would dispense to encourage good roleplay, and regular poker decks have Aces, so we put  two and two together. StoryHosts have a limited number of Aces to award (which enforces value-through-scarcity) for each Trait. Players can turn in their Ace at any time and return a card from their hand back to the deck, unspent, and instantly get another. It's the honorable way to offload a "No", but thematically it also represents a character whose strength of will (at least temporarily) is so strong that he essentially rejects his prescribed Destiny and takes another -by getting a new card. <br/><br/>I also have to thank poker decks for Jokers! These are mixed in in the decks at random, and are dispensed like regular cards. Answering a trait-check with a Joker doesn't mean "Yes" or "No", but rather "I'mma let you finish but first check out this crazy thing popping in suddenly out of left field". It's an invitation for some chaos and creativity on the part of the StoryHost. Say, instead of resolving a combat situation in favor of either contender, suddenly both of them have to dodge a drunk-driver who's barreling down on them from the highway overhead. <br/><br/>I just realized this is a giant big post <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> I have this tendency to tl;dr, so sorry!<br/><br/>Thanks again for the welcome, and for being a backer!                         </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440036">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440036/#Comment_440036" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-10T02:20:52+00:00" title="November 10, 2014  2:20AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This is an interesting Kickstarter rewards setup - will people also just be able to order the book and cards through drivethrurpg without backing? <br/><br/>Or, to put it another way, why back now, since you've gotten what you wanted and we can just buy it through drivethrurpg later?<br/><br/>Note, this is not a criticism, I actually quite like Kickstarter people asking for what they need and no more, and if you have what you need, we can high five each other for your success.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440043">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FableForge" title="FableForge"><img alt="FableForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/648/nXJ4O51HY3RHE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FableForge">FableForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440043/#Comment_440043" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-10T08:17:18+00:00" title="November 10, 2014  8:17AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote>Or, to put it another way, why back now, since you've gotten what you wanted and we can just buy it through drivethrurpg later?</blockquote>\nHi JD, you're absolutely right: anyone who prefers to buy the book later from DriveThruRPG will be able to for the same or similar price, so from that point of view there's really no reason to back now. But I'm fine with that.<br/><br/>The only two differences between backing now and buying the book later: if you back now then 100% of the profit I make from your pledge goes to the first batch of artwork, vs if you buy later, then first DriveThruRPG gets its 30% cut, and then the other 70% waits in a pile until it grows large enough to buy the second batch of artwork. I'm fine with that too; to be honest kickstarter is in a way a competitor to DriveThruRPG, and DriveThruRPG deserves its money too, finally, after putting up with serving every backer's order at cost, whether printed or digital. The only big winner who makes bank no matter what is Lighting Source, the printer.<br/><br/>A bit tangent to your point, but I think only the really really big name publishers are doing this for a living; most everyone else (I assume based on how little the big names are making per year) can't be doing it only for the money, and surely must have conventional jobs on the side. And I love that. Money shouldn't be the primary driver for making art, because if it is, then sooner or later you face the ugly choice of either selling out your baby or paying the rent, and that's a choice I wouldn't wish on anybody. So I'm happy most everyone has (again, I assume) a different source of income. That's part of what it's still beautiful and salvageable about our hobby as compared to nearly all others in the entertainment industry. It's getting harder though, and that has more to do with the demand side than the supply one, but I've gone long enough again and maybe that's a different discussion <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/><br/><br/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_440061">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley" title="JDCorley"><img alt="JDCorley" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/JDCorley">JDCorley</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440061/#Comment_440061" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-10T18:15:33+00:00" title="November 10, 2014  6:15PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            You answered my question thoroughly, and I absolutely agree with your approach.

The Seeing thing means a lot to me; now I wish I had included more of that chapter in the preview.<br/><br/>To answer your question: I've always known that what I want the most out of my roleplaying games is that fuzzy feeling of *foreign authenticity*, this emotion that if I had to put it into words, it would roughly read as "wow, that *really* happened. Somewhere, somehow, in our minds, in another world, in Plato's hyperuranium -I can't know where and I don't care, but *somewhere*... somewhere this thing actually happened. It took place and it lives apart from me, from us -but we get to see it somehow...". Writers are familiar with this "zone" where characters seemingly write themselves and the writer feels like he has to type faster just to catch up. That's real magic to me; that's why I play, and what I want other people to feel. And slowly it dawned on me that the ruler and chart were getting in the way. <br/><br/>It would often be in the middle of some amazing moment, some climatic overreach that we all would soon know as either heroic or idiotic, and everyone was on pins and needless (no one more than the SH) and it was just *painful* (sometimes in a good way, don't get wrong) to have to go "okay, what's your Agility stat again? 12, okay, and you're wearing the Amulet of Magnus for +5 right? And this guy, Mr. Geist, I have to give him at least 5 points for being in his home turf, but let's not forget the -7 from John's Hex -oh, did that time-out already? Oh yeah, it's the third round. Okay, hand me the ruler-" Etc, etc. It just slowed things down. And then, when you finally got The Number, say "OK Jim, you need to roll a *6* or better on this, or else she drops into the Devil's Maw" and then he'd roll a 3 or something -it felt sometimes *unfair*. Like... Jim deserved better... -and we all understand success and failure are just two sides of the same coin when it comes to building stories (there's this term I heard, "falling forward", which I love) but sometimes it felt like the dice had *too much* power. Why would the Gods of Randomness have more *say* in this story than us, the players, who are vested heart and soul into this thing?<br/><br/>So I knew I had to change things. I had the best number-cruncher, for sure, but numbers were fundamentally alien to what we wanted out of our storytelling.<br/><br/>Now, I've heard that some people who have had this same realization sometimes swing completely to the other side, and the game stops being a "game" as much as an exercise in collaborative storytelling -which is perfectly fine if everyone is in synch and enjoys the low stakes, but it's not what I wanted either. It would rob authenticity from the story if we could just change anything we wanted just because it makes us feel better. Realz &gt; Feelz. In the end, I wanted to put the authenticity of the story even above my own temporary preferences, because in the end -I made the bet- I would feel much more rewarded to *earn* something that was truly hard to earn. I wanted all the feelings of merit and realization which come with achieving difficult things, without making those difficult things slow down the story, or put more agency in randomness than in players.<br/><br/>So yeah, getting long again, lol.

Anyone can do a normal review.<br/><br/>I doubt I'll think it will stink because I actually quite like the original Shadowside, including the numbers (though I'm in the process of crunching through them). It's got a really solid cosmology, which many urban fantasy/horror game worlds don't have - since authors can get away with it in literary worlds (just try to explain Dresden Files vampires!) they assume GMs should do the same in game worlds. That's not the case; in fantasy we have to be really grounded in a consistent way and...well, that's my hook for the review. <img alt=":)" class="emoji" height="20" src="/forums/resources/emoji/smile.png" title=":)"/> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440093">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DarkMoonINC" title="DarkMoonINC"><img alt="DarkMoonINC" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DarkMoonINC">DarkMoonINC</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440093/#Comment_440093" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-12T09:03:02+00:00" title="November 12, 2014  9:03AM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Fable... did we just get a nod from the Out of Character Jason Corley &amp; The Pulp Gamer Crew show?

It feels a little odd for me to put myself back in the number-crunching mindset that the older version had. I'm biased for sure, but the new version feels so.... unburdened of numbers and chores that it makes me wonder how did I ever live with the previous one. Clearly, I had a different mindset before: "<i>Do all the chores before the session (like adding up Hierogamy + PC, averaging Secondary Stats, coming up with "Might" figures for combat per weapon, etc etc) so that the session runs smoothly</i>". It was a decent mindset, although a bit contradicting with the StoryHost policy of "don't plan"... <br/><br/>... the new mindset, by contrast, is "<i>Why chores?</i>". <br/><br/>Anyway, before I ramble too much: thank you for a very in-depth review, and I can't wait to hear what you think of the new one. I suspect you may find some counterpoints to the policies in the "Seeing" chapter which may be a tad too sink-or-swim, but we'll see! <br/><br/>Thank you again!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_440551">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/FableForge" title="FableForge"><img alt="FableForge" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/648/nXJ4O51HY3RHE.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/FableForge">FableForge</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/440551/#Comment_440551" name="Item_20" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2014-11-28T15:23:44+00:00" title="November 28, 2014  3:23PM">November 2014</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            P.S.
