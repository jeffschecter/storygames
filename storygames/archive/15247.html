He is referring to my use of orcs as natives in a conflict where the players are settlers.<blockquote><cite>Posted By: brayo</cite>Tomas is tricking his players, yes, but that's what GMs do.</blockquote>No, actually I'm not tricking my players. Most GMs I know don't trick their players.<br/><br/>If you want to understand my way of playing, and the results I get, this is a very important point. <br/><br/>I am <i>feeding the players interaction</i> with elements that are volatile, laden, provocative or shocking, to have the players experience that the situations are hard to control, and choices hard to make. And when choices are made, I follow up with consequences that makes the world come alive around them.<br/><br/>This is not trickery; it is <i>working the imaginative field</i>, deepening the theme and strengthening the conflicts, by simple and effective means. The players never have any reason to doubt my intentions. I will support their characters in scenes of harmony, in dealing with their everyday life, to make it easy to build a social base for their personality. But I will challenge their characters in scenes of conflict, to see how their personalities plays up in crisis. Through the characters, I will also strive to challenge the players themselves.<br/><br/>The point is to make players engage in the game, and to have them produce an emotional content that is in support of the game theme.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: brayo</cite>But a better question might be not whether orcs are truly evil, but: does the range of attitudes towards orcs map to the range of attitudes towards Indians?</blockquote>No, that is not a very interesting question at all; the orcs are not indians. <br/><br/>They are orcs, humanoids caught in a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">similar situation</span> to that of the indians (and other people that have been victims in such conflicts). I want them to act somewhat <span style="text-decoration: underline;">like humans</span> in that situation, invested with feelings of their own. The orcs should, being a fantasy-race, be sprinkled with exotic elements, of course. But ultimately; having orcs (or other NPCs) behaving in ways which are recognizable, helps us trigger emotional responses in the players. <br/><br/>That's where such game-play come alive. When we acknowledge feelings in others, it triggers feelings in ourselves. This is strengthening the emotional content of the game.<br/><br/>Doing this in fantasy games is great fun. It makes the games ten times as entertaining, and infinitely more interesting.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_346520">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla" title="Sodzilla"><img alt="Sodzilla" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Sodzilla">Sodzilla</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346520/#Comment_346520" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T04:50:58+00:00" title="October 20, 2011  4:50AM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2011 4:53AM by Sodzilla.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            *sigh* If you lead your players to expect one thing and then reveal another, that IS trickery.

Back in the late 80's and early 90's, we were doing "oh no, you massacred the orcs, but they're PEOPLE, gotcha you f*cking fascists!" setups and feeling terribly edgy and cool over it around here (Denmark). Is it really fresh wit elsewhere?<br/><br/>I mean, OD&amp;D GAZ10, "The Orcs of Thar" had D&amp;D humanoids satirically cast as every imaginable offensive ethnic stereotype and then inviting this kind of mind games about it, only very, very openly. And that's from (googlegoogle) 1988. With, yes, Native American orcs, alongside Arab gnolls and Imperial German kobolds.

The way I could imagine it going wrong was if your players somehow read it as a cast-iron guarantee that these beings were objectively evil. <br/><br/>To put it another way, at what level in the game is this going to be asserted as truth, from "it's just what some people in this world call them" upwards? If it is flagged too heavily as "just a name in the world" then it might give the game away too soon. But if asserted at too high a level, your players might legitimately feel misled later.<br/><br/>I don't know if that's clear, so I'll give an example from a LARP I played which is one of the few times I've ever felt cheated, although the GM acted in perfectly good faith. The person who played the murder victim of course died fairly early on, so when a police inspector turned up to investigate the crime, no-one was particularly surprised to see this player reappear in a new guise. The problem was that the GM had decided to make a virtue of a necessity, and make the resemblance between the murder victim and the policeman part of the plot (they were related). But we all deliberately looked past the resemblance in game, and never commented on it, because we didn't want to flag up something that might damage people's immersion. You see the problem? It arises from confusing in-game vs out-of-game truths, I think.<br/><br/>Edit: cross-posted with Troels who is making the same sort of point about how this can become problematic if done too crudely, although I don't see you as likely to fall into this trap.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment Banned" id="Comment_346557">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap Banned" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM" title="TomasHVM (Banned)"><img alt="TomasHVM" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://cd8ba0b44a15c10065fd-24461f391e20b7336331d5789078af53.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/images/banned_large.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/TomasHVM">TomasHVM</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/346557/#Comment_346557" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2011-10-20T15:34:49+00:00" title="October 20, 2011  3:34PM">October 2011</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited October 20, 2011 3:39PM by TomasHVM.">edited October 2011</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Dave Hallett</cite>it wasn't quite clear how the "these are orcs" part was going to be presented</blockquote>They've been presented in various ways, always as an implied fact of the world,<br/><b>depending on who is talking:</b><br/>- prejudiced rumormongers: Orcs are filthy, thieving, murderous beasts!
