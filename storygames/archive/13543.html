One of the reasons I've come to enjoy the Story Games so much is that many of them have this baked right in, but its perfectly possible to easily inject the right amount of it into DnD or Savage Worlds or whatever... I'm much more interested in the gestalt being Macro in nature, and less worried about the freedom to micromanage every little aspect of every encounter... 'I roll GM describes' is usually fine if the descriptions are good, and I have some input into how we got there and where 'there' is, exactly.<br/><br/>-Jim C.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306010">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Nameless" title="Nameless"><img alt="Nameless" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Nameless">Nameless</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306010/#Comment_306010" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-26T23:13:17+00:00" title="December 26, 2010 11:13PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            This may be a cop out, but look at Lady Blackbird. It has all the things that make a campaign great for me. Evocative but lightly detailed world ready to be explored and contributed to by every participant, and harnessing fun tropes that allow people to almost instinctually understand the setting. Baked in situation that outlines the interests and motivations of the key players, while allowing the possibility for "changes of heart." Interesting characters with connections to the world and each other, but with enough freedom for interpretation and growth. A GMing style of guided contribution to encourage player creation of the setting. Starting with a bang, and progressing at a pace that reiterates the themes and tone of the game. Game mechanics that do not detract from the smooth creation of narrative and meaning in the fiction. Lady Blackbird is almost a perfect case study in how to create campaigns that matter to me.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306017">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/migo" title="migo"><img alt="migo" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/migo">migo</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306017/#Comment_306017" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T02:21:34+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  2:21AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Something I've found works reasonably well is having a good reason to keep everyone close, even if they're doing their own thing. Having the game set in a school, where all the school events are a backdrop keeps everyone together. It also supports having someone not show up one session and then be there the next - their character is obviously home sick.<br/><br/>Expanding to a university setting for adults would do the same thing. If all the characters are enrolled in one fashion or another, there's a reason for them to all be around there in the general area, they have flexible schedules to do the adventuring stuff, but having to work on a term essay right before it's due is again a reasonable enough reason for one character not being there for a session. It even makes sense for having them show up out of the blue (which is really the session is picking up where it left off on the next day).<br/><br/>The other thing with this kind of setup is it's plenty great for intra-party conflict, which leads to some rather interesting roleplay that can make the game a little more compelling for some people                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306050">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Andy" title="Andy"><img alt="Andy" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/194/nVH754K87RJBR.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Andy">Andy</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306050/#Comment_306050" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T09:51:27+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  9:51AM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            For me, it's all about the people.  The reason that the same doofuses assemble around the table week after week for years is that we really enjoy gaming with each other regardless of system or campaign. From With Great Power to Hellas to L5R, "when in doubt, Roleplay". The strength of in-character role-playing has carried us through both awesome and mediocre games.<br/><br/>Lately, my sweet spot is the "5-12 session campaign". I am also loving systems with equal parts traditional (stats/skills/combat) and hippie elements (fanmail, setting your own goals, etc).<br/><br/>-Andy                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_306068">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom" title="jdfristrom"><img alt="jdfristrom" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/304/n7P7805BO4MLT.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/jdfristrom">jdfristrom</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306068/#Comment_306068" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T14:10:43+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  2:10PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited December 27, 2010 2:21PM by jdfristrom.">edited December 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I thought I knew what love was and then I played Apocalypse World.<br/><br/>One thing that may have helped keep our AW run going despite absences was I'd e-mail AP to everyone, let them know what they missed...                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_306080">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg" title="David_Berg"><img alt="David_Berg" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/060/n3Y7XYSNN00G5.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/David_Berg">David_Berg</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/306080/#Comment_306080" name="Item_6" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-12-27T16:07:52+00:00" title="December 27, 2010  4:07PM">December 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            1) GM has lotsa cool secrets about people and schemes and powers and how stuff works<br/>2) players have goals and ways to pursue them, but also have the ability to modify them depending on what grabs their interest<br/>3) pursuit of player goals reveals GM secrets<br/><br/>Alternatively:<br/>Char-gen gets each player psyched to see what they can do with this character in this situation (whether strategically, thematically, or just putting on a memorable show), and each character change refreshes this passion.
