The game is what HG Wells would have played (I think). The situation is that Austrian Captain Von Fritz leads a detachment into a village on the Ottoman frontier. They are there to round up deserters (but everyone will have a secret agenda as well). The Captain has ten stands of infantry (15mm figs) a few cavalry scouts and a stand for himself. The village contains women and children, fields surrounded by flocks of sheep, an Imam (cos this is a Bosnian village), and a few men. It sits on a river which is the border. Across the river there is an Ottoman outpost with a small detachment of guards with a small cannon. Off board there is the potential for a lot more Ottoman infantry and cavalry, and for more deserters for the village. The players will add them in as they play.<br/><br/>All the players are in a way playing Von Fritz (who wants to round up the deserters) but they will also be championing (and moving) other people on the board (villagers, deserters, Turkish nobles, Turkish infantry, and Austrian soldiers.) The secondary goals are for those characters (hooking up with a local sweetheart, stealing sheep, fighting a duel with a Turk nobleman, ravishing the local virgins, etc.) Each goal also assigns the player a role - Good or Bad. If the are good they are to try and help Von Fritz out. If they are bad, they want to make his life difficult. <br/><br/>So the question about what the game is about is:<br/><br/>Accomplish the mission objective<br/>Accomplish your individual objective<br/>And help or mess over the hero of the story.<br/><br/>As they play, the player give one another coins to show they like what the person has done. At the end of the game the winner is the one with the most coins (minus coins they did not hand out). So the game is really about doing the most entertaining moves.<br/><br/>The rules are simple. Each turn the players may move all their figures.<br/><br/>Cavalry - One cubit<br/>Infantry - One hand span<br/>Artillery - One finger length<br/><br/>In a turn a player points at a spot on the board and starts a scene. They say what happens, (then people can move). Other players may jump in and challenge that by saying what happens instead. They settle which happens by Rock-Paper-Scissors. Other wise the next player to the left says what happens next. At any point a player can jump in and point at another part of the board and start a new scene. The game goes on scene by scene until the game host ends the game. The host is to give lots of foreshadowing that this is about to happen so people can hand out their remaining coins. <br/><br/>I'm doing some on line play with these rules and done some face to face play using picture cards to start scene, and it players like a conversation. Energy builds and people get excited and rambunctious. Pretty fun. <br/><br/>I really looking forward to how it plays with the historical wargamers. <br/><br/>What do you think?<br/><br/>Chris Engle                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368929">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368929/#Comment_368929" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-22T23:18:25+00:00" title="March 22, 2012 11:18PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            A few general thoughts:<br/><br/>1) I'm am deeply saddened that I live so far away across the country that I don't get to play in one of these games when you're putting them on!!!!<br/><br/>2) Beyond that, I'm still muddling through similar types of concepts myself. here's where I'm at in my thinking right now. i don't know whether this stuff will help with your game, but please steal, test and modify any of this stuff and please let me know how it turns out.<br/><br/>The Central Conceit:The Players are the Creative Team making a film about the given scenario.<br/><br/>This is kinda big and central for a few reasons.<br/><br/>First, it implies that players are detached from the  characters. Normally, in an RPG or wargame, this is a Bad Thing. In this case though, it's a good thing. <br/><br/>It frees players to portray different characters throughout the course of the event. Multiple players playing a given character at different times may help to smooth out and develop a very basically sketched character.<br/><br/>It frees the GM to free up and open up backstory. Instead of having a direct player to character relationship, the GM can put all of the "secret" stuff out there for all players to engage with.<br/><br/>It allows for players and the GM to  make asides in or out of character and even just discuss or state what they think ought to hapen, including possibly interesting Bad Things happening to a character that they've been portraying. It's a bit like the way a writer can write up all sorts of horrible things happening to one of their main characters without trauma, frustration, or guilt.<br/><br/>It means that even if disaster befalls a character, the player can still play throughout the whole event (no player Freeze Out due to in-fiction events).<br/><br/>Kibbitzers and bystanders can sub in and players that need to take a break or leave early can do so with massive game-play disruption.<br/><br/>Players can pick and choose what parts of the fictional character pool and situation the want to explore and emphasize in the developing fiction (a bit like Vanilla Narrativism in Forge-y lingo).<br/><br/>Implications for miniatures tabletop usage:<br/><br/>By going with the film conceit, we can dispense with fiddly measures of time and space, much the way that people who use no miniatures or maps do. Except we still get to play with all of the cool toys, so <i>Yay Us!</i> we get the best of both worlds!!<br/><br/>So, rather than worrying about exact measures of moving around prior to a scene, we could just plain let a participant do something like say, simply declare where a scene takes place and who is there, and what the boundaries of the scene shoot are ( I found this to actually be kinda important ina test run of an old rule set). They can do it on their own or, better, with help from everyone ( again bystanders and kibbitzers can come in here).<br/><br/>For that matter, we can kinda ignore some of this stuff in scene too. We can speed up the action, or slow it down as we choose and have interest in the goings on. We don't even need to be really consistent in this. Mostly we can do it by way of agreement and freeplay, only throwing in some kind of resolution mechanic as we see interest in variable result possibilities.<br/><br/>Playing like this also has practical implications for table top modelling too. An interesting interior location where we have a whole lot of foreseen action going on can have a large tabletop footprint, while an outside area that should in scale be much larger might have a smaller or similar one, and it's all okay. It isn't a direct military map at scale; it's a Hollywood backlot and implications of camera technique and sets representing the concepts of spatial relations for the audience.<br/><br/>I know that's kinda vague, but if you'd like an example, hypothetcal or actual play, I can try to descibe one.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_368930">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/komradebob" title="komradebob"><img alt="komradebob" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/komradebob">komradebob</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368930/#Comment_368930" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-22T23:59:56+00:00" title="March 22, 2012 11:59PM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            General structure of game<br/><br/>How the scene based play works out will depend upon the number of players and the amount of time you have total.<br/><br/>As part of the central conceit, the amount of time you have for the game slot represents the total shooting and production time you have for the film in scale.<br/><br/>If you have a four hour game slot, the scenes for the film need to be shot and the film in the can (and the response from udiences) all taken care of in that amount of real world time.<br/><br/>If you're putting on the event, it'll be up to you to watch the clock and facillitate wrapping up scenes and the shoot as  whole.<br/><br/><b>The game with 2-4 players plus GM</b><br/><i>First Reel</i><br/>GM deals out cards labelled 1,2,3,4(only equal to number of players)<br/>GM sets starting scene, recruits players for key roles in scene<br/>Play scene, with GM facilitating and demonstrating by example and questions any key resolution mechanics being used.<br/>GM ends first scene<br/>Player holding scene card one is now in charge of setting next scene. t can extend the previous scene, follow the previous scene in the near future, or take place elsewhere with different characters ( <i>Meanwhile, Back at the ranch...)</i><br/>Play scene, GM facilitates, asks input, encourages players to use resoltion mechanics or call for their use, and facilitates ending of scene.<br/>Players with other cards each in sequence set up a scene as above, GM continues to facilitate scenes and demonstrate mechanisc usage, encouraging players to take up more personal initiative.<br/>After last player plays out scene, we take a break.<br/><br/><i>First Intermission</i><br/>Real world people relax, BS about the event, what they'd like to see,what characters and secrets and scenario/setting stuff they'd like to see more of, and have refreshments and snacks.<br/><br/>GM facilitates above, watches time, and calls everyone back to game.<br/><br/><i>Seond reel</i><br/>The GM deals out cards as in the first reel, but deals themself a card also.<br/>Play pretty much proceeds as in the first reel, but the GM doesn't start the second reel unless they have the 1 card.<br/>Play as above. The GM acts as a helpful expert player, but eases back and lets players mostly take the lead in all of the above. Still keeps track of time.<br/><br/><i>Second Intermission</i> <br/>Pretty much same as first. M encourages discussion with all players on how they'd like the Big Final scene to go off. Encourages some collective ideas, and wrangles players towards consensus electing one player as faciliator of the Big End Scene. GM calls players back to table for climax.<br/><br/><i>The Big Finale</i><br/>For the Big Finale, use the whole board as a location.<br/>GM faciltates and aids the elected "director" among the players tying everything all together among any surviving characters and setting up a bunch of ways eerything connects, but is NOT finallized.<br/>Once this is in order, it's just plain free play with the GM facilitating, aiding, encouraging players to call for resolution mechanics use and so on, and looking for a good stopping point to close the curtain. Loose ends are fine.<br/><br/><i>Wrap session</i><br/>The GM officially announces the event is over and the film is in the can and has been released.<br/><br/>The GM then hands out or places cards with questions on them about how audiences reacted to the film. If he hands them out, each player gets one. The other option is to place them face up and have players choose among them, one each, order of picking the cards by any convenient method.<br/><br/>The question cards are open ended and come in two varieties.<br/><br/>The main variety is simply for any game, especially though for convention games or play with strangers or one-offs. These are really just a way  to encourage players to say nice thigs ( or funny things) about each others' play and performance, without being quite as intimidating as stuff like fan mail. it doesn't have any direct game play effect. It's just a nice way, post event play, of giving each other warm fuzzies (perhaps in the way of gentle ribbing).<br/><br/>The second variety is optional, and can be included at GM's choice, perhaps mixed in with the main type. Some of them are frankly compliment grubbing for the GM. hey, why not? More practically, they're there to elicit feedback from players about what they liked, and help the GM come up with ideas for follow up events using the same or a similar set of toys.<br/><br/>( Again, examples available upon request).<br/><br/>That's pretty much it.  By this point, the game time slot should be over. Declare a player winner and perhaps in-fiction winner, by group acclaim, if desired. Perhaps secondary sorts of recognition can be given as well, although the answers to the questions on the cards should already imply some of this kind of stuff.<br/><br/>Variation: Larger number of players, 6-16<br/> <br/>Instead of having individual cards for setting scenes, have two sets or even three sets numbered 1-6 or 1-8 or whatever. Deal out as above, but players with the same number are going to have to come up with the scene as a commitee.<br/><br/>Variation: really large numbers:<br/>Have a second GM and two "filming units". During first reel play, each unit is seperate and the second GM makes sure things stay seperate. At first intermission, everyone comes back together for snack time and compares notes. At this point, memebrs from each unit can switch up as they choose, but must break back into roughly equal teams for the second reel. GMs must make sure to leave extra time for the Big Finale.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_368960">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer" title="MatrixGamer"><img alt="MatrixGamer" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/MatrixGamer">MatrixGamer</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/368960/#Comment_368960" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-03-23T08:15:11+00:00" title="March 23, 2012  8:15AM">March 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I've seen a lot of the things you described in the first post happen. I especially like the ability for player to come in and out of the game. Not certain others see that as a strength but I think it's cool. <br/><br/>I wasn't planning on using any movie structure to guide the play this time. I want to see how leaving out that structure works. Last years I was heavily structuring the board games I made. They work but are a lot of work. This year my kick seems to be moving towards the most minimal rules possible. To see where that leads. One thing it allows is to make an on-line facebook game.<br/><br/>Someday I think it would be cook to bring a miniatures game to the Games on Demand room at Origins or Gen Con. The pick up nature of it wll would fit the format and maybe the toys would appeal to players.
