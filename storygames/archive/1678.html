                    I just had an epiphany about the ADRP system, and why people like it.<br/><br/>Players don't see any difference.<br/><br/>D&amp;D Player: "I rolled a fourteen, with my +2 sword that makes sixteen.  Did I hit him?"<br/>GM, looking down behind his GM screen, and pretending to check the AC: "Hm, yes."<br/><br/>ADRP Player: "My warfare is 32.  I also have better armor and a horse.  Can I beat him?"<br/>GM, looking at his notes: "Hm, yes."<br/><br/>Players have much the same experience playing ADRP as they do with a GM who's fudging.<br/><br/>GM's like it better because they don't have to lie -- they're playing it by the book.<br/><br/>Just another reason why recruiting from existing hardcore ADRP fans makes no sense for my Amber LARP rules.                </div>

                            I'd imagine that there are other reasons people like ADRP but that said, this could be why it doesn't feel like much of a stretch to some gamers.                        </div>

                            Thanks for the link, Judd.  I've read that essay before, but didn't mind reading it again.<br/><br/>I don't know that it really answers my question, though.<br/><br/>While everyone is familiar with diceless roleplaying if they have ever roleplayed <i>(assuming that Mr. Wujick is correct in his essay)</i>, why does it follow that folks that enjoy playing Amber will not be interested in Fred's mechanical variation on the setting?<br/><br/>I've been playing Amber for going on thirteen years now, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the <b>Call of Cthulhu</b>, <b>World of Darkness</b>, or <b>D&amp;D</b> games that I played.<br/><br/>Why would I be less interested in Fred's Amber variant than I would be in those games?<br/><br/>I feel like he's saying that I wouldn't enjoy playing <b>Burning Wheel</b> because I've been playing <b>Middle Earth Roleplaying</b> for so many years.                        </div>

                            Some Hardcore ADRGP player, and they exist, though their numbers are in question literally play _nothing else_ but the DRPG and variants on it.  Anecdotally, this is frequently accompanied by assertions that other systems are too fiddly, complicated, or whatnot, and that they don't want to learn any new system.  <br/><br/>For these players I'd extend Fred's realization a tad and say that playing the Amber DRPG is functionally indentical to playing a game which you do not wish to understand.  To wit, the guy who knows D&amp;D is going to put some meaning in the roll, but the person who just wants to play their character and simply rolls what they're told when they're told could really be using any system, and if that's their goal, the ADRPG serves them very well indeed for the sheer amount of stuff they don't need to keep track of.<br/><br/>This is certainly not all Amber players, but this particular segment is probably the hardest sell for Fred's ideas.   <br/><br/>-Rob D.                        </div>

                            Okay, let me put this a little more plainly.<br/><br/>There are certain DnD gamemasters who don't keep track of monster hit points, or armor class, or much of anything; when they feel that the heroes have taken an appropriate amount of punishment given the skill of the heroes and the toughness of the monsters, the monsters die and the heroes win.  This is a deeply illusionist style.... and more common than you might expect.<br/><br/>This is not a game where the player doesn't care to understand the game... he has no chance of ever understanding the game.  His to-hit rolls and damage rolls are meaningless.  It's not really DnD at all but the players don't know that.<br/><br/>As such, however, it is no different from the ADRP conflict resolution mechanism!  So if that group starts playing ADRP... they find it a very comfortable match.                        </div>

                            So, as I understand it then, what you're saying is that current Amber players won't like your game because they've never used a system that they have understood before.<br/><br/>Now I'm back to being confused.                        </div>

                            Hm.  I'm going to AmberCon NorthWest in a week and a half, who are pretty much hard-core Amber players.  As far as I've seen, they're pretty open to new systems -- they just also tend to like the Amber Diceless system.  Last year there I played Polaris, Primetime Adventures, a variant of Dogs in the Vineyard, and Lee Short's GMless tarot-based system.  <br/><br/>I guess as far as recruiting them goes, the key would be to not sell it as "A better system for Amber because ADRPG is for players who like to be ignorant and lead around by the nose."  Don't think of it as the "right" Amber system, think of it as an alternate Amber system.                        </div>

Of course "assuming Wujick is correct" is a really big assumption. What I always took away from that essay was the feeling that Wujick was exactly the kind of guy I would rather stick forks in my eyes than run a game for. The whole essay is basically him congratulating himself for browbeating his GM into letting him get away with stuff.<br/><br/>As for why ADRPG fans wouldn't be interested in a new Amber variant ... well this is just my feeling, but I think a lot of ADRPG players are as much into the DRPG as they are into the A (if you see what I mean). This is particularly true of Wujick himself - there's that awful, awful bit in the back of the rulebook where he talks about how "the best form of roleplaying is pure role-playing ... no dice, no books, no rules" and I think a lot of ADRPG players buy into that philosophy.                        </div>

                            I wonder if that's why Amber made such an impact.  It recgnised what was important about that particular style of play and just jetissoned all the rules baggage that sometimes undermined it or diverted player attention at the table.  It identified and catered to an already extant (and incredibly popular) play style.  <br/><br/>The value of it isn't that it necessarily brings something new to the table, but that it stripped everything back to enable The Fun as much as possiblet.  Which goes along nicely with that article - Erick Wujcik identified what was fun and unfun about the gaming he'd experienced and simpy ostracised the unfun.  It's just that in this case the unfun was most of the formal mechanical systems and the fun was the basic model of what was actually going on at the table.  And that the system behind  the fun at the table wasn't terribly amenable to being formally described.<br/><br/>Amber does strike me as one of those games that capitalises on the inherent fun of rpgness as much as it brings its own awesome to the table.  Which isn't to say that it <i>doesn't</i> bring its own stuff of course.  There's no small amount of nifty in there - but the core of the game ain't it.<br/><br/>But then maybe I'm talking out of my ass.  I've always had trouble grokking Amber's <i>identity</i> as a system.<br/><br/><i>Disclaimer: Please take me at my word that I'm in no way trying to portray Amber in a negative light.</i> </div>

Taking him at his word, he identified the underlying "system" behind the game and cleverly used that to his advantage. Taking the more cynical interpretation, he decided on the system he wanted to use, and needled the GM into letting him use it.<br/><br/>Either way, though, I think Fred's initial observation - the Amber can be thought of as GM Fudging codified into an RPG, and that the (very large) number of people who like to play that way will clearly enjoy it - is a good one.                        </div>

                            Amber DRPG <i>can be thought of</i> as GM fudging codified into an RPG.<br/>It <i>can be thought of</i> as a 'deeply illusionist style' where Players cannot hope to understand the mechanics.<br/><br/>It certainly isn't written that way. It <b>is</b> written in a way that allows the GM to adapt/drift the mechanics as far as they like. But as written the conflict system on four axis reminds you to <i>parse ahead in character</i> and avoid conflict where you will lose and take advantage where you will win.<br/><br/>Online, I've seen the mechanics changed to D20. I've seen the mechanics changed to 'logic tree' style. I've seen the mechanics changed to Everway style. I've seen the mechanics done as letter game and as social game. I've played some of these.<br/><br/>Conventions are perhaps not a good example of play, since folks spend $$$ and precious time to converge and have fun. An easy way to do this is to know (very well) ahead of time what you are playing and how it works. Even so, there are games played that use D20, or Everway, or home brew at conventions.<br/><br/>I agree with Thomas: Amber players are all about the fun and avoiding the unfun.<br/>Do you notice a pattern between parsing fun/unfun and what I've said about conflict in the game system?<br/><br/>To broadly suggest that these bright people are beholden to a system of deception is odd. To suppose a large segment of the Amber players are ok with flexible trust mechanics could be accurate.                        </div>

Hmm.<br/><br/>I think that to some extent that's an issue with the nature of the playstyle it's trying to cater to.  I'm not comfortable using the  term illusionism, because I'm not 100% on the term, but I mean that whole "ask GM for permission, he tells you what happens" thing with a dose of "pay no attention to the man behind the curtain" GMing techniques.  That style's pretty much incompatible with any kind of system that restricts GM authority.<br/><br/>See I reckon that the core of Amber's system <i>is</i> that playstyle.  The mechanics of the game - what <i>looks</i> like a system (highest stat wins) - is not the important bit of the game's system.  It's a red herring.  Just a tool to provide a baseline for GM judgements and (maybe) a handle for players without providing so much structure that it can challenge the GM's power.<br/><br/>Being overruled by GM whim is the mechanics working as intended, because it trusts (requires!) the GM to be making the right decisions rather than (helping the GM by) telling them what those right decisions are.  It's a minimal support structure designed to facilitate that play style that I'm not sure I should be calling illusionism.  The meat of the system is the knowledge of RPGing that you bring from your prior experience, and all the rants and advice about what "real roleplaying" looks like and how to be a good GM in the book.<br/><br/>Which, incidently, is why I don't like ADRPG.  I don't like that play style.  I also don't think Amber gives GMs enough tools to do it really well unless they already know what they're doing.  I don't feel that I'm necessarily better off with the amber book than I am without it.<br/><br/>By the way - this (pretty much everything I've posted in this thread) is me thinking out loud.  I'm being verbose because I'm working ideas through for my own benefit, not because I'm trying to beat other people's opinions into the ground and raise mine up like the tower of Babel.  Apologies to Vaxalon if I've contributed to de-usefulising the thread for him.  But for what it's worth he's helped me get a better handle on Amber.  Also apologising if I'm breaching forum etiquette by doing the thinking-out-loud thing - new here and still not entirely sure of what' is and isn't out of line.<br/><br/>But, getting back to what I was replying to before I started babbling, Tony; what kind of stuff did you mean when you talk about the implicit system you end up using when you play Amber?  I think I might be agreeing with you, but I'm not entirely sure.  Hence question asking.  Plus I'm intrigued.                        </div>

                            Both play styles Fred observes (in Amber and D&amp;D) are GM fiat. The style greatly overlaps, but is not 100% equal to Illusionism.<br/><br/>Why is this controversial or offensive to some? It's a play style preference. Some people like it, some people don't. Why do discussions about Amber frequently result in emotional battery on one side or the other? It's needless. Saying "Hey, Amber uses GM Fiat as a system" is sort of like saying "Hey, you wear shoes with velcro instead of shoestrings" or "Hey, the cover is red."                        </div>

                            Well, Matt, it's because the velcro can rub you the wrong way if you try it.<br/>
<br/>
Amber is, if not broken, misleading. People have had very bad times playing it because of this (I'm one). Yes the playstyle is valid. But the system is not. People will percieve an attack on the system that they're using as an attack on their style of play - and there's nothing so heretical to a RPG player as somebody attacking your style of play. So between people who have strong problems with the system, and people who support it, and feel crticism's are attacks.<br/>
<br/>
Now, that all said, I'm not really seeing much acrimony here. Did I miss the contentious part?<br/>

Er, Vaxalon's left -- but I'll answer his questions anyway.  At AmberCon NorthWest there was a lot of play set in the Amber universe but not using the Wujcik ADRPG system.  <br/><br/>Last year, I played in the Amber setting using a GMless tarot-based system (Lee Short's <i>Star, Moon, &amp; Cross</i>) as well as a Dogs in the Vineyard variant ("Amber's Watchdogs").  I've heard a lot about "Amberway" (Amber using the <i>Everway</i> system), though that's also diceless.  This year, there's also a <i>Don't Rest Your Head</i> Amber game this year, along with "AmberQuest" (Amber using <i>HeroQuest</i>), and a few larps.                        </div>

                            First time I showed up at ACNW, I ran a "young elders" game using a minimized version of Fudge and a story concept that was kitbashed with the original D&amp;D cartoon.  I've encountered a TON of weird-ass homebrews there; the community, in my experience of it, is more there for the community-itself and the gestalt of folks familiar with the base setting.                        </div>

True enough on the camps, though IME, of all the rpg mailing lists I've been on, Amber-L had the highest product of "traffic x comity." There were flame wars - I understand Fred was recently blasted pretty hard frex - but a lot of it was just good clean hard-hitting but fair intellectual fun.<br/><br/>I think the real "constant among Amberoids" isn't "strong GM play" so much as <em>high mimesis play</em>. It's just that nobody has yet come up with a good system for producing high-mimesis play with a weak GM - or at least, if they have, they haven't bottled it. My money's on Neel.<br/><br/>Best,<br/><br/><br/>Jim                        </div>
