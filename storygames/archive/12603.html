The paper is Forest Stewardship Council Certified, which basically means it comes from recognised sustainable sources. It provides a viable alternative to recycled paper, which is nice.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalcolm                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_282931">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/walkerp" title="walkerp"><img alt="walkerp" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.conventionofassassins.org/blog/mortimer90Transparent.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/walkerp">walkerp</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/282931/#Comment_282931" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-26T10:59:36+00:00" title="July 26, 2010 10:59AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I downloaded this issue after seeing you discuss it on the thread over on therpgsite and it is really impressive.

Let's see if we can make that happen in the next possible Atlantic coast connection we make.<br><br>I have to admit that I'm a bit intimidated by Cold City and Hot War.  I'm a big consumer of British genre fiction.  John Christopher is one of my all-time favourite authors and I love all the other great classics of literature and television that came out of Britian's post-war anxiety.  But I feel that I wouldn't be a strong producer of it.  I get the British mindset from that period, but I really don't know if I could capture it for others.  I think this is why I've been hesitant to dive into these games since they are otherwise so much in my wheelhouse.  So that's a long way of saying if you want to take charge, I would be totally psyched to participate.                        </br></br></div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_283053">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig" title="Malcolm Craig"><img alt="Malcolm Craig" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://picasaweb.google.com/contestedground/UntitledAlbum/photo?authkey=UQZ1oivg8Lc#5239981636020065186"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Malcolm%20Craig">Malcolm Craig</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283053/#Comment_283053" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T01:29:41+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  1:29AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited July 27, 2010 1:30AM by Malcolm Craig.">edited July 2010</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey guys,<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks for the kind comments. The issue of the British cultural milieu and mindset was actually raised by Jason in a discussion elsewhere (actually, in the rpgsite thread that you mentioned) and it prompted me to write this (which relates primarily to Hot War, rather than Cold City:<br/>\n<i><br/>\nIt has always been my hope with Hot War that the way the game is presented would help people understand the setting and milleu in a way that gets past the "I know nothing about Britain in the 1960s!" gut reaction. The majority of the game development actually took place while I was living in New Zealand, with great success. Although, it must be admitted that there are strong cultural links between NZ and the UK that still exist.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's been my experience that people unfamiliar with the time period actually do have more of a grasp than they thought: the archetypes of 'Swinging London', the Beatles, even Austin Powers movies. Even these little associations with British culture of the early 60s are often present and can help form the basis for understanding.<br/>\n<br/>\nTo flick back to your initial paragraph, there is a certain 'Britishness' about the game and its setting. It is very firmly rooted in the work of J G Ballard, John Wydham, TV series such as 'Quatermass and the Pit', and films such as 'The War Game' and 'Threads'. All of these present a British view of the apocalypse, horror, SF, and the nuclear threat. Yet, many of these basic ideas are touchstones that we are all familiar with.<br/>\n<br/>\nIn the end, I don't think lack of familiarity would be a barrier to enjoying the game. I certainly can't seen any more difficulty than coming new to Greyhawk or the Cthulhu Mythos, for example (although, I'll admit that those are both settings which are far more expansively detailed and in-depth that Hot War!). Each group would, and should, create their own vision of the UK in post-apocalypse 1963. If that's a vision coming from Sean Connery era 'James Bond' movies rather than the nuclear brutality of 'Threads' or the new-wave stylings of Ballard, then that's far from a problem. Things like the Player's Primer in the back of the book should, I hope, give a fictional framework that people can hang things on. But, it's not proscriptive.</i><br/>\n<br/>\nAlthough, if you end up playing a game with Joshua (and I sincerely hope you do), do not under any circumstances let him play James Bond.<br/>\n<br/>\nCheers<br/>\nMalcolm                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_283056">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion" title="Silverlion"><img alt="Silverlion" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/943/nF5ZRHUHC8M5A.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Silverlion">Silverlion</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/283056/#Comment_283056" name="Item_5" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-07-27T02:26:12+00:00" title="July 27, 2010  2:26AM">July 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Awesome stuff as usual.<br>I really want to try this out as a player before I GM it.
