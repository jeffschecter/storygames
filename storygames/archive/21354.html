It's been a while since I visited. I've been working on a few different systems. This one is called This and That, and it's a more lightweight set of rules.The system is genre-neutral, through I'm going to write up a medieval romance setting for it, with more to follow later.<br/><br/>The game takes some inspiration from the Cypher System, some from PbtA (mostly about fictional positioning) and a few other games. Just a note that the red text is to show what I changed in the latest content update.<br/><br/>If you're interested in checking it out I'd love feedback, either here or as a comment on the Google doc. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1stq6RmhSTf0C8c6DEwELQHx6J_1IaUNzhmEnuIG-Djc/edit?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1stq6RmhSTf0C8c6DEwELQHx6J_1IaUNzhmEnuIG-Djc/edit?usp=sharing</a> </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467567">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467567/#Comment_467567" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-08T21:45:40+00:00" title="November  8, 2017  9:45PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey there. I'm a bit sad that no one commented on this thread, so I'm jumping in.<br/><br/>Unfortunately (and this may be why others didn't comment), I don't have a whole lot to say.<br/><br/>The "system" looks like a fairly derivative clone of a "lite RPG" from about 20 years ago. It doesn't tell me anything about how to actually play the game, what makes that interesting or fun, or how it's different from other RPGs.<br/><br/>That leaves us with a decent text and a basic dice mechanic (which, to me, at least, doesn't offer anything new or interesting). I don't particularly like doing the math before rolling (I bet you could design this more elegantly - adding and subtracting a number before making a roll is OK but not terribly smooth), but that's ultimately a taste issue.<br/><br/>Does your game offer anything new, different, or unique? If so, you've done a poor job of communicating that. Some more detail about that in your post here might have attracted more attention! <br/><br/>How does one actually play? What does the GM do? What is the creative focus of the game, and what makes for a good session?<br/><br/>I don't want to be entirely negative: the text is well written, and you've clearly put some thought and some work into this. I like the attention placed on how to declare actions in the game - most games just ignore that kind of detail and leave it up to the group, but you've tackled it, which is nice to see.<br/><br/>I hope that helps you in the future! It's entirely possible that this is not a design issue but a presentation issue. (For instance, even the title communicates very little about the game, and may be limiting the attention you're receiving.)<br/><br/>In any case, talking about your game some more - design goals, parameters, struggles, etc - might do the trick, instead of just posting a link. (People here get barraged with new drafts of games daily, so their fatigue is understandable.) Good luck!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467569">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup" title="DiscoSoup"><img alt="DiscoSoup" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DiscoSoup">DiscoSoup</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467569/#Comment_467569" name="Item_2" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-08T22:00:41+00:00" title="November  8, 2017 10:00PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Hey, this is actually pretty useful feedback. I was thinking that It might makes things go smoothly if everyone had their Skills, stats, powers/special gear and core concept on cards. So you just whip out the ones that you want when you're rolling and that could allow for faster play.<br/><br/>I'd be interested in knowing which game from 20 years ago this reminds you of. I wouldn't mind checking it out.<br/><br/>The idea for this game was to make it easier to write up after action reports or to write in play-by-post games. That way you get "Lothar mightily [or a similar adverb for strong] swung his axe" or "Lothar Mightily (9) Swung (4) his axe (2)" instead of "Lothar applied his STR bonus (+3), BHB of 10 and Heavy Weapons (Axe) skill (7) to the roll.<br/><br/>I do plan on a GM advice section. That is probably going to be the last part of the game that gets written up.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467571">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T" title="Paul_T"><img alt="Paul_T" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Paul_T">Paul_T</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467571/#Comment_467571" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-08T23:39:39+00:00" title="November  8, 2017 11:39PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Glad that was helpful to you.<br/><br/>It's not reminding me of a particular game, although of course the d20-roll-under mechanics are very <i>D&amp;D</i> or <i>GURPS</i>-esque, while the interest in English-readable action statements reminds me quite a bit of <i>Fudge</i>.<br/><br/>I developed a system at some point (about 15 years ago) which used a scale of Adverbs to create very English-readable mechanics in concert with <i>Fudge</i> mechanics. You could say, for instance, that it would be Very Hard for you to knock down a Reinforced door, given your Poor strength (or, because you are Weak), and have that translate directly into dice and odds.<br/><br/>Speaking for myself personally, I think game design has evolved beyond such concerns these days, and exciting developments are about how we interact with each other in a game, and what kinds of behaviours the game creates. Where does it push us? Where does it lead us to explore something in detail we normally might be tempted to ignore? What are the creative goals of this particular game - why do we play? How does this design help us do that? Etc.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_467573">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk" title="WarriorMonk"><img alt="WarriorMonk" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/WarriorMonk">WarriorMonk</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467573/#Comment_467573" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-09T06:04:23+00:00" title="November  9, 2017  6:04AM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I did commented on the document though, as others did for what I've seen. What I wrote there was perhaps more an opinion than advice, though it comes from testing with similar designs. The argument goes around these lines: Tabletop rpgs are, above everything, a conversation about a shared fiction. This conversation gets interrupted by conflict resolution mechanics that produce changes in the fiction, then the conversation goes back to the fiction.<br/><br/>Making the system produce artificially part of the conversation is somewhat unefficient, as it forces the players to switch to thinking on math and then on grammar mechanics, then back on math and then finally back to the fiction. I admit the result will probably be added quality for the literary component of the conversation, but asking the players "How exactly do you do that?" whenever they start to limit their input to mechanical terms does a more efficient work on this IMHO, by saving time and not forcing the players this back and forth switch between opposite frames of mind.<br/><br/>These kind of mechanics tend to look amazing in paper, but their performance at the table leaves much to be desired.

Stanburh Castle, and maybe the Crookshead section, is going to have options for romance.<br/><br/>I'm starting with the Scadrey Woods section because it's easier to write and helps me get a clearer direction. I know that it looks mostly like combat now, but the bandit section and the Golden Tree section have the opportunity for diplomacy and intrigue. <br/><br/>The Northern Moors are going to be about exploration, combat and rabble-rousing. The more urban and castle sections are also going to have the opportunity for intrigue and courtly stuff. Like do you want to support Lord Westenra's bid for the throne or make your own? Not to give anything away, but you can use some of the quests in the Woods and the Moors to build a power base or credibility for yourself.<br/><br/>The full release is also going to detail two other counties. You can ally with, support, subvert or conquer any of the provincial rulers in the quest to see who takes the throne. <br/><br/>I'm going to give each of the three nobles a positive and negative trait. Lord Westenra is committed to the rule of law, but he's not concerned about peasant rights and is very draconian in his application of punishment and conscripts laborers for military service that they can't afford to perform.<br/><br/>The Countess to the east of Westenra lives ina county with few natural resources. Her woods are a swamp and there are no mines. Her people live primarily off of farming. TO expand her power base the Countess sponsors education and technological development. She's paranoid that others have so much more than her, military-wise, that she doesn't have any qualms about sending saboteurs out to collapse mines, burn fields and assassinate people, all in the name of maintaining political equilibrium.<br/><br/>The third ruler is the Earl of the county in which the royal castle sits. He's the one that most people view as the popular choice to take the throne, and he has the church's backing. He's relatively easy-going and lenient with the peasants, so long as they fall in line with the church. He also hands out favors to the clergy and overlooks any crimes that their members commit.<br/><br/>Sorry if this is TL;DR. Just wanted to give you a picture of where it's going, and that it's not all combat. You might ascend to the throne or back your chosen lord without ever going to war.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_467581">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/DeReel" title="DeReel"><img alt="DeReel" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/149/nNS7SNDJ10GP6.jpeg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/DeReel">DeReel</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/467581/#Comment_467581" name="Item_7" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2017-11-09T16:53:36+00:00" title="November  9, 2017  4:53PM">November 2017</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited November 9, 2017 4:54PM by DeReel.">edited November 2017</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            It's not too long, but is is combat oriented.
