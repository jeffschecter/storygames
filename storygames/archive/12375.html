Once he released ATFM, I kinda lost interest in the project, but here's the latest version for your perusal, downloadable free from lulu.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.lulu.com/product/ebook/hearts-clubs-murders/11478411" rel="nofollow">Linky.</a><br/><br/>So what's this? By association with ATFM, it's obvious: it's an Agatha Christie murder mystery-type oracle, with a few game mechanics bolted on. It's far from polished, but hey, what the hell, free games. If you read or god-forbid play it, let me know so I can make it better some time down the road.<br/><br/>Oh, and the cover sucks because it was auto-generated online. And the layout sucks because my Publisher decided to crash and burn and took the pretty version with it. So, despite what the text says, the document was NOT laid out in MS Publisher, but in Open Office.<br/><br/>Tell me how hard it sucks.                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_277752">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277752/#Comment_277752" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-24T17:54:06+00:00" title="June 24, 2010  5:54PM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Oh, that looks really interesting.

I'm not proud of it, it's not a finished game, it doesn't work reliably. I'm just trying to warn you, in my own, hyperbolic way, that your experience will it might be bad. It's just a little thing I worked on for a while that has reached a standstill, but I want it out there because someone might find it useful or offer me useful feedback.<br/><br/>Be sure that when I get something out that I'm happy with, I'll announce it with all the fanfare. (When I get Pilgrims to Ruin done or my AW hack is finished.)\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Graham</cite>Oh, that looks really interesting. Have you tried playing it?</blockquote>\nSeveral times, both with my girlfriend and my gamer group.<br/><br/>It relies a lot on the player's skill and genre-savviness to produce effect. You have to introduce your own speculations and facts to make sense of the relationships. Then about 65% of the time you get really cool stories like "the murderer was the father of the murdered secretary's employer, because she was blackmailing him with proof of his son's homosexuality" or "the killer was the sister of the victim's husband, because the victim was a slut that slept around a lot, including with the sister's fianc\xe9e". And the other 35% all you get is just a relationship map with no friction at all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_277791">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Graham" title="Graham"><img alt="Graham" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.catchyourhare.com/images/LittleChef.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Graham">Graham</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/277791/#Comment_277791" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2010-06-25T03:36:45+00:00" title="June 25, 2010  3:36AM">June 2010</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Gregor, we should get in touch about this.
