As a gamer and a queer person, I'm eager to see how Joe has addressed these issues of identity and desire within the game text and its structure.<br/>\n<br/>\nJoe, could you tell us more about how you approached such topics in the text? You've been clearly vocal about it with the fundraising campaign, but I didn't run into these things when I participated in a playtest last fall. Was 'queer' on your mind when you set out to make the game? How did it become wrapped into the project? Are there specific mechanics and rules in the game that bring the topic up, or is it mostly embedded in the setting and flavor of the game?<br/>\n<br/>\nFor those of you that have played Monsterhearts, did queer desire and identity come up in your play? What was the tone at the table like? Did you or your group come to new ideas and understanding through your play? Was playing through the game more transformative than watching it on screen would have been?                </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356946">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman" title="Ross_Cowman"><img alt="Ross_Cowman" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-2VVx8Kc--zY/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAACZ8/3Pco6NeJ4Ng/photo.jpg?sz=32"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ross_Cowman">Ross_Cowman</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356946/#Comment_356946" name="Item_1" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T09:56:45+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  9:56AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            There is a section of the book specifically about including queer content which I find well written and awesome.

You're hiding that difference, and you feel like it makes you a monster in the eyes of the rest of the world. If the wrong people were to learn your secret, it could lead to a lot of pain and danger for you. That secret is inextricably tied up in your body and your sexuality. Being a flesh-eating creature of the night is equal parts literal premise and allegorical premise. It's an exploration of what it means to be non-normative.<br/><br/><b>The Queer Mechanics</b><br/>In Monsterhearts (like in the real world!), you don't get to control what you find sexy. You get to control how you react to that information. The <i>turn someone on</i> move (as well as other mechanical bits throughout) are structured to make sexuality a messy and unpredictable force in the game, very specifically allowing the possibility of queer desire. Not every session played has queer characters or queer arousal, but importantly the mechanics create that space and highlight its potential.\n<blockquote>When you <b>turn someone on</b>, roll with hot. On a 10 up, take a String against them. \u2022 On a 7-9, they choose one: give themselves to you, promise something they think you want, give you a String against them.<br/><br/>When you use this move, you have the opportunity to step outside of your character role, and speak like an author would. Describe your character\u2019s pouty lips, how the sweat rolls off their strong brow, and how they look silhouetted against the pale moon. Unlike other basic moves, this one can be triggered without a specific action being taken. If the player describes how arousing the scene is, without their PC actually doing anything other than standing around and looking sexy, the move can still be triggered.<br/><br/>This move implies something about sexuality, and particularly teenage sexuality. We don\u2019t get to decide what turns us on. When you make a move to <i>turn someone on</i> (with a character action or with scene description), the other player doesn\u2019t get to exclaim, \u201cWait, my character is straight! There\u2019s no way that\u2019d turn them on.\u201d That\u2019s a decision that we as players can\u2019t make for our characters. The dice are going to be the ultimate referees of what is and isn\u2019t sexy for these characters. Their own sexuality will confuse them and surprise them; it\u2019ll show up in situations they didn\u2019t expect to find it in. Regardless of the results of the roll, however, each player still gets to decide how their character reacts. Being turned on by someone doesn\u2019t imply or demand a reaction.</blockquote>\n<b>The Queer Text</b><br/>I was vigilant in ensuring that queer examples and mentions of the kind of alienation that queer youth face is sown throughout the text in little ways. My goal here was simply to normalize the possibility of queer characters, and to remind people to step outside their expectations.<br/><br/>There's also a section about why &amp; how to go about introducing queer content into your game. I wrote it with a great deal of support and critique from a queer, trans, poly friend of mine.\n<blockquote><b>Queer Content</b><br/><br/>This isn\u2019t really a game about monsters. It\u2019s a game about the confusion that arises when your body and your social world start changing without your permission.<br/><br/>Your story will be more interesting and real if it includes queer content. It\u2019s another dimension of isolation and anxiety to explore through your characters. It\u2019s another way to keep the story feral, by breaking down our own expectations of heteronormativity. It\u2019s another way to introduce messy, unrequited love interests into the picture.<br/><br/>Remember that the turn someone on move can create statements about a character\u2019s sexuality. If Lukas rolls to turn on Jackson, and succeeds, then we know that Jackson sometimes gets turned on by other guys, at least this once. It doesn\u2019t replace what was previously true about Jackson, necessarily, but it does add a new dimension to the character. Maybe Jackson\u2019s still straight, maybe his relationship with his girlfriend is still as stable as it\u2019s ever been, but we also know about these other feelings he's experienced. And given that Monsterhearts is a game about messy, sexy melodrama, chances are it\u2019ll push Jackson into new and uncomfortable territory.<br/><br/>When I suggest that you introduce queer content, here are some examples of what I mean:<br/>\u2022 Be willing to be surprised about who your character turns out to be and what turns them on.<br/>\u2022 If you\u2019re a vampire, ask yourself: does feeding on boys feel the same as feeding on girls? Do your feeding preferences line up with your sexual preferences? In what ways is vampiric feeding a sexual thing?<br/>\u2022 If you\u2019re a mortal, take a couple as your true love.<br/>\u2022 Explore what it means to be betrayed by your body, whether it\u2019s becoming a flesh-eating monster that stalks the night, or being trans and experiencing the wrong puberty, or both.<br/>\u2022 If you\u2019re the MC, introduce queer characters, and make them fundamentally different from one another. Let their sexuality and gender be incidental in some cases, and let it be the chaotic thing that drives the story forward in others.<br/><br/>Use the game to explore and challenge your own ideas about gender, sexuality, relationships, what\u2019s normal and what\u2019s monstrous.</blockquote>\nNote: All text quoted here is draft text, as the editor is still hard at work behind a curtain somewhere.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_356990">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/356990/#Comment_356990" name="Item_3" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T11:35:28+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 11:35AM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe, you know, you're a really fucking awesome dude!<br/><br/>I just wanted to say that publicly, as if there was any doubt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357008">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen" title="James_Mullen"><img alt="James_Mullen" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/767/nQ4UFI2NS0OJ1.PNG"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/James_Mullen">James_Mullen</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357008/#Comment_357008" name="Item_4" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T12:34:49+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 12:34PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2012 12:35PM by James_Mullen.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Yeah, that rocks: I love how the <b>turn someone on</b> move works... but has anybody ever objected to or questioned it?

A number of people have questioned it or expressed concern with it. My default answer is, "Well, try playing the game as written, and see how it turns out for you." I feel like the entire Monsterhearts package is really alienating to some folks, and those people have probably already decided that the game isn't for them by the time they encounter this move.<br/><br/>The move's explanatory text was worded differently at one point, and it carried connotations that I hadn't meant for it to carry... and on that subject, a playtester unpacked at great length how it made him uncomfortable and was problematic. But that's part of what playtesting is about, I think. Words and ideas mean different things to each of us, and playtesting helps us learn about our own assumptions. It happens to be that I'm playing with volatile words and ideas in the design and writing of this game.  The playtester's concerns were about a few careless sentences that made a sweeping and unintentional statement about "how much control you get over your character's reaction." So I changed them, and now that problem isn't alive.<br/><br/>The important thing about the <b>turn someone on</b> move is that it doesn't dictate or demand a response. Rick turns Mitt on, with his beautiful green eyes and his half-smirk. Rick gets a String on Mitt. It's now a totally valid response for Mitt's player to say, "Yeah, so maybe I'm turned on, but I don't show it. I go back to working on my science project." That's not bad roleplaying or blocking; it's a totally normal way to process weird information - by just ignoring it. Rick still gets what he was after, that String over Mitt.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357020">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357020/#Comment_357020" name="Item_8" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T12:59:09+00:00" title="January 31, 2012 12:59PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>Yes!

Someone does something to you, how do you react?<br/><br/>So, first up, I'd explain that to Potential Unhappy Buyer. If they already understood that, then I'd fall back on standard customer service: if someone was unhappy with a product they bought, and they expressed their unhappiness to me in a civil tone, I'd go out of my way to make things right (a refund, or sending them an additional game, or something like that). If they expressed their unhappiness like a jerk, I'd apologize curtly and move on.<br/><br/>In the promotional material, I try to make it as clear as possible what Monsterhearts is. There are pictures of shirtless dudes in almost all of the art that I use to promote the game. I use words like "messy" and "volatile love triangles" and "teenage angst" wherever possible. I've made clear on the IndieGoGo page that proceeds will (hopefully) be going towards an LGBT charitable organization (and will do so on the Buried Without Ceremony page once the game is available for regular sale).  I feel like I've given people a pretty good idea what to expect in this regard.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357023">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone" title="Johnstone"><img alt="Johnstone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/157/nDQVQ7V3KPJ20.gif"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Johnstone">Johnstone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357023/#Comment_357023" name="Item_10" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T13:19:44+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  1:19PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I would think a simple picture of two guys making out would seriously limit that particular sort of buyer's remorse, yeah?                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357027">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357027/#Comment_357027" name="Item_11" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T13:24:38+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  1:24PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2012 1:25PM by Mcdaldno.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            [redacted]                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357029">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost" title="skinnyghost"><img alt="skinnyghost" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/42UpB.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/skinnyghost">skinnyghost</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357029/#Comment_357029" name="Item_12" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T13:32:49+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  1:32PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Joe: I wasn't implying that you weren't already making efforts, I just wanted to see how you were addressing what might be an issue.  I think it's a different sort of affect than being stabbed and I think that the GM in most games can't or won't say to a character "you feel sad / happy / embarrassed" even though those are things that happen to a person regardless of what they want to feel.  Monsterhearts having direct mechanical means to say "this move makes you feel a thing" and then ask "what do you do about it" is an interesting element and not something I've seen before.  Anyway, it looks to me like you've got it totally covered.  Very cool.<br/><br/>Johnstone: I didn't mean "people will have buyers' remorse when they realize the game contains LGBT material / themes / whatever"  I meant "buyers remorse" when they realize the game contains a rule that's a bit out of left field.  Primarily, people who buy the game before, as Joe said,  "probably already decid[ing] that the game isn't for them by the time they encounter this move".  Some folks, I suspect, when the GM says "okay, well, Captain of the Football Team Werewolf just rolled to turn you on and you are turned on." are going to feel a little out of their element and discomfort can lead to bad press.  I was curious how Joe was thinking about that, is all.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357037">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz" title="ccreitz"><img alt="ccreitz" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://www.entirelysafeandfun.com/hi5.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/ccreitz">ccreitz</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357037/#Comment_357037" name="Item_13" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T13:55:43+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  1:55PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n<span class="MItem"> <span class="DateUpdated" title="Edited January 31, 2012 2:09PM by ccreitz.">edited January 2012</span> </span> </div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Mcdaldno</cite>The dice are going to be the ultimate referees of what is and isn\u2019t sexy for these characters.

You know?  I mean, when I go a whole AW campaign without anyone using a sex move, it feels a bit like we did it wrong.  I wonder if Monsterhearts without any of the I turn you on / you turn him on stuff is "doing it wrong" as the rules are written.  It kind of sounds like a game where you can't veil that stuff in the same ways.\n<blockquote> i want to avoid any sexual interplay between our two characters because you're giving me a ride home later and that makes me feel squeamish,  then i won't make that move towards your character.</blockquote>\nI guess this is where I sort of wonder about veils and lines and Monsterhearts, because you're allowed to not make those moves towards my character, but if I say "I do X and it turns you on" and I roll well enough, doesn't that mean your character is turned on?  I guess this is where Joe's bit about having the character just ignore it works out.  <br/><br/>Interesting stuff, this.

The best way to get strings on other PC's is to turn them on, and you need the strings for some of the custom moves.

Turning someone on is crucial to the game, as it ties directly into the String mechanics, which are the fundamental mechanical engine for turning the teen-angst melodrama up to 11. You can gain Strings in other ways -- including Shutting Someone Down emotionally, which I imagine is a very popular response to being turned on by someone who you'd really rather not find sexy -- but turning people on is the fastest, easiest way to do so.\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: CamBanks</cite>And no, it isn't the LGBT/queer aspect of it, but the entire sexuality/turned on/control of physiological response mechanics. It's a critical part of the genre, though, so putting it right out there is spot on.</blockquote>\nMost of us worked our asses off to get to the stage of our lives where we can at least pretend that we are in control of our bodies and our sexuality. And many of us suffered at small or great length before we managed the trick, if we ever managed it at all. Going back to that place -- and not just going back there, but realizing that the game is built to revolve around the horror and consequence of that particular feeling of power &amp; powerlesness -- is not exactly a casual activity. But it is a critical part of not just the genre but the teenage  experience that the genre uses as a touchstone. <br/><br/>That said, whether you go to the place itself or to the genre-trappings that live on top of it is going to be up to the group, and I think that while the stuff quoted and discussed in this thread present a very real and important facet of the game, the game remains effective if you choose to tread lightly, and lean on genre emulation whenever you would otherwise start to feel uncomfortable.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357085">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno" title="Mcdaldno"><img alt="Mcdaldno" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Mcdaldno">Mcdaldno</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357085/#Comment_357085" name="Item_21" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T17:09:35+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  5:09PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            Thanks for all the lovely discussion, people.<br/><br/>I'd just like to call out two things:<br/><br/>(1) This is a thread where I was asked to highlight how the game handles queer content, sexuality, desire, and the like. And so I really went under-the-hood with my description, and brought a lot of my own personal politics along with me. But in play, this stuff is often as simple/unexamined as, "So, my sexy vampire totally gives you a sultry look as you brush shoulders in the hall. I'm rolling to turn you on. 10. Sweet, I totally get a String on you." MC: "So, Vicky, Raleigh bumps shoulders and gives you this look, right? What do you do next?" I don't want to downplay the fact that it's a game about brooding hotties, because that's a huge part of the game... but I want to stress that it's not as... charged at the table as it might appear in this thread.<br/><br/>(2) This is a game I've played at several cons with strangers. It's not for everyone, definitely, but I've felt totally comfortable playing this with strangers, and strangers have felt totally comfortable playing this with me. The moves and mechanics and "vying for most Strings held" all work together to ease people into the idea of playing characters whose sexuality matters. And just like in any other game, player discomfort can be addressed at a social contract level: lines, veils, excusing oneself from the session to go play Munchkin instead, etc. But most people, I find, quickly slide into a comfort zone that they didn't expect.<br/><br/>That said, my favourite games include Bacchanal, Hot Guys Making Out, and Apocalypse World.

This has been an uncontroversial aspect of gaming for decades. As a recent example, nobody is pissed as hell at Geoffrey McKinney for including it in <i>Isle of the Unknown</i> (on page 88/90, if you must know). Nobody has even mentioned it.<br/><br/>It's not being able to say, absolutely, "my character's not gay" that would cause the buyer's remorse (or, granted, the incest example, above), if anything. And it's <i>a lot</i> harder for that person to rationalize away two guys making out, <i>especially</i> butch guys in leather jackets, than just shirtless guys, volatile love triangles, messy teenagers, or even the LGBT charity.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357103">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/UserClone" title="UserClone"><img alt="UserClone" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://i.imgur.com/npxRL.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/UserClone">UserClone</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357103/#Comment_357103" name="Item_25" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-01-31T19:36:26+00:00" title="January 31, 2012  7:36PM">January 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: skinnyghost</cite>I mean "doing it wrong" in the sense of like, ignoring some crucial in-the-rules aspect of the game.

I mean, I remember being 15 and having a serious crush on some of my wrestling teammates, and being at the same time so turned on and wishing I wasn't because of what I thought the consequences would be if anybody found out.  <br/><br/>And that's a pretty terrifying place to be, emotionally.  I can totally understand why people would want to change the rules as written to get away from that, or to interpret "turned on by" broadly, though it seems to me that the rules as written are aimed precisely at that sort of experience.  Sometimes games are unintentional therapy for me -- in retrospect, I realize I worked through a lot of these issues in a Vampire game I ran, one that still gets mentioned fondly, and I think it was such high quality because I was so invested in it, although it wasn't conscious.  Other times, games need to be escapism, and if I found myself wanting to play Monsterhearts as escapism, I'd probably dial back the "turned on by" rule as well, *because* it hits so close to home.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357115">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper" title="John_Harper"><img alt="John_Harper" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/uploads/userpics/004/nT4BI8NP40ONN.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/John_Harper">John_Harper</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357115/#Comment_357115" name="Item_27" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-01T00:32:04+00:00" title="February  1, 2012 12:32AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            I am *so* thrilled with this aspect of the game, Joe.

Recently, in a Primetime Adventures one-shot, I played a girl who'd seduced her father to get even with her mother. I've played a gay, pedophile priest convincingly enough that nobody at the table dared talk to me afterwards. I ran a game with only female players that turned into a huge lesbian drama (and got turned on when I had three girls hugging on the floor, waking up from a threesome* (but hey, what man wouldn't???)).<br/>I love the challenge. I love that I occasionally learn something about myself from the game. I love bleeding afterwards**.

There was a bit of a pause for discussion there, because she felt that the mechanics reinforced a sort of male "hey, I'm gonna turn this lesbian straight cause I'm awesome" thing. <br/><br/>We talked a little about how in the game world and in the media it pulls from, sexuality is more open and fluid, and that it's not really connected to any one person's perception of reality OR has any real scientific backing, but is just indicative of the source material. Everyone was familiar with the source materials I think Joe was going for and we all threw out examples, both supporting and defending. Every was cool and we had a cool discussion that stemmed from a game, so yay.<br/><br/>It's a game that needs trust, I think, or at least a disclaimer, but I think it's important to note that the game isn't necessarily about reality, but about a certain type of fiction that necessitates a fluid sexual code.                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item Alt ItemComment" id="Comment_357327">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K." title="Ethan K."><img alt="Ethan K." class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2475/3619178655_cd765940c5_s.jpg"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Ethan%20K.">Ethan K.</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357327/#Comment_357327" name="Item_39" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T10:13:36+00:00" title="February  2, 2012 10:13AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n<blockquote><cite>Posted By: Christopher</cite><br/>It's a game that needs trust, I think, or at least a disclaimer, but I think it's important to note that the game isn't necessarily about reality, but about a certain type of fiction that necessitates a fluid sexual code.</blockquote>\nI won't get into an argument here about fluidity of sexuality and gender, but I want to note that it's really cool that the game is prompting players to articulate and interrogate their ideas about 'real' sexuality and desire.<br/><br/>Bravo, Joe!                        </div>\n<div class="Reactions"></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li><li class="Item ItemComment" id="Comment_357331">\n<div class="Comment">\n<div class="Options">\n</div>\n<div class="Item-Header CommentHeader">\n<div class="AuthorWrap">\n<span class="Author">\n<a class="PhotoWrap" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson" title="Orlando_Wilson"><img alt="Orlando_Wilson" class="ProfilePhoto ProfilePhotoMedium" src="http://story-games.com/forums/applications/dashboard/design/images/defaulticon.png"/></a><a class="Username" href="/forums/profile/Orlando_Wilson">Orlando_Wilson</a> </span>\n<span class="AuthorInfo">\n</span>\n</div>\n<div class="Meta CommentMeta CommentInfo">\n<span class="MItem DateCreated">\n<a class="Permalink" href="/forums/discussion/comment/357331/#Comment_357331" name="Item_40" rel="nofollow"><time datetime="2012-02-02T10:25:41+00:00" title="February  2, 2012 10:25AM">February 2012</time></a> </span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="Item-BodyWrap">\n<div class="Item-Body">\n<div class="Message">\n                            "Might have smoked a few in my time <br/>But never thought it was a crime <br/>Knew the day would surely come <br/>When I'd chill and settle down <br/>When I think I've found a good old-fashioned girl <br/>Then she put me in my place <br/>If everyone's a little queer <br/>Can't she be a little straight?"<br/><br/>Also, the mechanics also reinforce "The gays are gonna turn you gay with their gay agenda and homosex!" conservative rhetoric. <br/><br/>Speaking from my own, real life experiences in the queer scene, I've had strictly lesbians say things to me like, "I really want to fuck you but you have a dick and I'm not okay with that."
