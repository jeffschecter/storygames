                    One of the things I'd like to spend some time on with my Summer Project for Kids is haggling and bargaining basics.  Negotiation being so important both in gaming and outside, as well as a part of so many fantasy stories, I'm looking for both games where this is part of the strategy, as well as good examples in general to strengthen both mine and my students' skills.  Anyone working with something like this?                </div>

                            Stake-setting is essentially social bargaining for mutually acceptable (and ideally mutually satisfying) outcomes.  I'd look to games where you negotiate stakes, which are manifold.                        </div>

                            Pretend for a moment I am a complete idiot, or newbie to the terminology, since it's not a stretch.  Can you give me some concrete examples?

                            If both parties are committed to bringing the fun, I don't think you can fail at stake-setting.  It is a skill, though, that you have to learn and polish.<br/><br/>REMI:  OK, so the Cuban mafia boss whose son I had an affair with has sent his assassins to kill me, and they've caught me in my underwear in a laundrymat?<br/><br/>JASON:  Yes!  Conflict!<br/><br/>REMI:  OK.  If I win, they shoot me in the stomach and take me to the crime boss in the trunk of their Mercury Sable.<br/><br/>JASON:  Cool!  Those are some high stakes.  And if you lose, they kill you in the head!<br/><br/>REMI:  No, that's no fun.  <br/><br/>JASON:  OK, how about if you lose, they kill your lover Miguel before your eyes!<br/><br/>REMI:  Lame and also impossible if we play by the rules. <br/><br/>JASON:  If you lose, you get away scott-free but feel terrible about yourself?<br/><br/>REMI:  What's wrong with you?  How about if I lose, I kill <i>them</i> in the head while a Cincinnati news crew films it?<br/><br/>JASON:  Agreed!  You better spend some fan mail on this one...                        </div>

                            Stake-setting sounds nothing like bargaining or negotiation, at least in that context. It sounds like brainstorming.<br/>
<br/>
The key to negotiation is controlling the flow of factual information and linking it to the flow of emotional decisions.  This holds true even if all sides have access to all information.  Let me give you two real life negotiation examples from my work with me as a participant-negotiator. I represent Child Protective Services in cases of child abuse and neglect and one step in the process is a settlement conference where the parents and their attorneys haggle with us over what their clients are willing to admit to, and we haggle with them over what we require them to admit to. Failure of settlement means a costly and tedious trial whose outcome is very rarely in doubt.<br/>
<br/>
Situation 1: Deep In Denial<br/>
<br/>
Father's Attorney: "Well, JDCorley, it looks like my client wants a trial."<br/>
<br/>
JDCorley: "That's his right of course, but what can we do to resolve this situation without a trial?" (information provided: 'I want to resolve this')<br/>
<br/>
FA: "He isn't willing to admit that he failed to protect the children from the mother's abuse, he didn't know it was happening." (information provided: 'father is in denial')<br/>
<br/>
JDCorley: "Well, he doesn't have any beef with the idea that the abuse occurred, right? We have medical records, the statement of the child and the mother..." (information provided: the first step of proving the allegation)<br/>
<br/>
FA: "No, that's true. He just didn't specifically know about this abuse." (information provided: first step of establishing limits of father's knowledge)<br/>
<br/>
JDCorley: "He had some idea something was going on, though, right? I mean, he was seeing the kids pretty regularly and this was not the first time that anything happened, he may not have known specifics, but..." (information provided: I will cross-examine your guy on this point and he will admit he knew something.)<br/>
<br/>
FA: "Let me talk to him, perhaps he will admit that he had concerns but didn't know specifics..." <br/>
<br/>
JDCorley: "Thus leading to a failure to protect. Really that's our chief goal, he needs to take some responsibility for leaving this child in the care of the person who ended up abusing the children." (information provided: my general goal)<br/>
<br/>
As a participant-negotiator, I know that in order to reach my goal of an agreement with this man, I can't hit him hard between the eyes with all the evidence I'm going to put on at trial, that will just firm up his positino that he needs to deny everything and not cooperate with me at all. Instead, I need to provide information in a steady stream that carries him towards the decision I want him to make - and then at the end, instead of ending with a "hardball" statement of specifics and demands, I end with a "softball" statement of general principle. That way the father's attorney doesn't have to go back and box his client into a corner, he can instead allow him to make the decision I've led him to.<br/>
<br/>
The emotional end of this is important too.  When I was in law school we want to a professional mediator to observe how he worked. <br/>
<br/>
Situation 2: The Mediator<br/>
<br/>
We had a mock case involving two companies in a dispute over a business deal. The plaintiffs were asking for $500,000, but were secretly willing to settle for $400,000.  The defendants had made a previous settlement offer for $250,000.  You would think that this would be intractable. Oh hell no. The mediator told us that normally he would be keeping the attorneys separate and shuttling between them but for purposes of observation he was keeping us in the same room. <br/>
<br/>
Mediator to Team 1: "What's your bottom line?"<br/>
<br/>
Team 1: "We will settle for $400,000, that's our bottom line."<br/>
<br/>
Mediator: "All right, hang on." (goes to Team 2) "Okay. I've looked at this case. Do you really think it's only worth $250,000? I mean, okay, $500,000 is ridiculous, but how high can you go? You know it'll easily cost you a million to litigate this. I'm not asking you for a figure, but could you go higher than your previous offer? No figures. I don't want a figure, just think about it..."<br/>
<br/>
Team 2: "Well...we could go higher."<br/>
<br/>
Mediator: "I THINK I can get the plaintiffs down to $400,000. I can't guarantee it. But I think I can. If I can get them down to $400,000, would you be willing to talk over amongst yourselves where exactly your ceiling is? Just talk about it, no guarantees, no pressure."<br/>
<br/>
Team 2: "...sure, we'd be wiling to talk, if you could do that."<br/>
<br/>
Mediator: "I'll see what I can do." (back to team 1) "All right, guys. They've agreed to talk about coming up on the figure, I want to throw your $400,000 figure out there, is that cool?"<br/>
<br/>
Team 1: "They're willing to talk? Sure, that's cool."<br/>
<br/>
Mediator: "All right, but you have to give me some kind of range so I can know what we're dealing with. I got the $400 grand, what kind of wiggle room do you have on that? IF they're really willing to talk turkey and throw out this stupid $250 grand offer."<br/>
<br/>
Team 1: "If they want to talk, let's say you have fifty grand to work with."<br/>
<br/>
Mediator: "Sounds good." Back to Team 2. "Guys...they came down to $400 grand...but I think they're a ltitle shaky even on that. They could go lower. I'm confident that they can go lower. It's their choice of course but I'm not going to let them walk out of here with a $400 grand offer on the table, at least, at LEAST they're going to have to come down another fifty to $350 grand. You agreed to talk it over, how high can you go?"<br/>
<br/>
Team 2: "They came down to $400 grand?"<br/>
<br/>
Mediator: "Forget the $400 grand, that's a bad offer and we all know it's not worth that much. But they gave up $100 grand of the lawsuit, that puts you in a good position, can I take back an offer of $300 grand? That's only fifty grand more than you already offered, you're spending that much on this mediation anyway."<br/>
<br/>
Team 2: "...okay, $300 grand."<br/>
<br/>
Mediator: "But unless they come down from that $400 grand bullshit I'm not even going to talk to them, they need to be serious about this case."<br/>
<br/>
And so on.  Basically the mediator used what the other side had already agreed to, in order to emotionally manipulate the situation until both sides felt they had the upper hand in the negotiation.  It was really amazing to watch - and even KNOWING he was manipulating us, you still felt the same emotions of "we're winning" even though you knew from hearing his conversations with the other side, that he had already achieved what he was promising to attempt if only we would promise to get a little closer.                        </div>

<b>JDCorley</b>, that was fabulous, and just the kind of thing I'm trying to show the kids (and, it looks like, the adults in the group.)  I wanted to bring attention to this line, though:
<blockquote>The key to negotiation is controlling the flow of factual information and linking it to the flow of emotional decisions.</blockquote>
I'm sure there's a wealth of information out there on how one of the things we want in "successful" gaming is to have the players <em>feeling</em> their characters and events as much as it is easy to <strong>think</strong> them through.  (Goodness knows I've made decisions on sudden impulse that have changed games, both as GM and player.   Of course, when they're "<em>from the gut</em>" they tend to be more memorable.)  <br/><br/>Now, I'm gaming with kids, and emotional manipulation of children is a dark "grey zone" for me.  Just one of my little personal rules.  In the context of gaming I'm willing to let go a little because one of the reasons I'm roleplaying with them in the first place is to kind of solidify the rules between fantasy and reality (a line that will help limit the drama they're heir to in the future!)  <br/><br/>I think part of it is that when reading <b>Jason Morningstar</b>'s "stake setting" example the emotional conviction was only implied.  It DOES suggest that when I use this kind of negotiation, I should "make it an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">event</span>," rather than "<em>simply another encounter</em>."  So unless I have hooks (or stakes or whatever you want to call them) in the market, or the players want to make more of haggling for the price of tack, (as opposed to the price of <b>tact</b>) I can let it go with rolled dice or a gentle play through or whatnot as to the bargaining.  If they want to pull some kind of "hard sell," I can look at these guidelines to see how to run it.<br/><br/>(I'm beginning to suspect that this is why we're seeing a lot less of a "charisma" score kind of thing in more 'modern' games.)                        </div>

                            Well, negotiation IS emotional manipulation. That is one reason there really isn't negotiation (in the normal sense) between parents and small children - that's not what the term is about, the power differential is too great, one person holds all the cards, and so on.  The difference between negotiation and brainstorming is that negotiation takes place in an atmosphere of limited resources. It might not quite be a zero-sum game (indeed, in some cases, it's "worse" than a zero sum game) but it's pretty close. Even if you have the same goal, and one hundred percent transparency, you're giving something up in "real" negotiation.  The two stake-setters in the first example above give up absolutely nothing by going with each other's ideas or rejecting them. They are neither impoverished by giving ground or gain by taking it. <br/>
<br/>
That's not to say that every negotiation is two-sided or that an agreement is not better than a failed negotiation. In my first example, I really didn't give any ground up at all to the father's attorney, because I needed to get him from "no" to "maybe", before we could even talk about where we could agree.                        </div>
